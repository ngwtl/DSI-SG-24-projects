*(I created a reddit account to post this trip report - apologies in advance for any formatting issues!)*  


Despite the resurgence of ultramarathon races post 2020-season cancellations, venturing out to Killarney to run the full La Cloche Silhouette trail has maintained a constant pull on my running ambitions. La Cloche was the trail that ignited my passion for backpacking, which leant itself to climbing, then to alpinism, to hobby-jogging when climbing gym closed due to the pandemic, to serious ultra-running and racing. Now, having just completed running La Cloche in its entirety, I find myself back where I began, the same yet entirely different.

Running La Cloche felt like the end of an early chapter in my outdoor pursuits; something that remained unfinished before moving on to bigger things. I’ve done my best to recount my experience in hopes that it might inform – or perhaps inspire? – others who seek to do the same.

  
**Trip Report**

Anticipation and angst meant I didn’t hit snooze when my 4 a.m. alarm nagged me out of my sleeping bag. After a cup of coffee, two leftover pancakes from the previous night’s breakfast-for-dinner (highly recommended), and a reluctant shedding of my warm puffy, we started the running watches\* and set out at 4:50 a.m. from George Lake’s campsite 30, fittingly the single farthest point from the eastern trailhead of the La Cloche Silhouette Trail. 

*(\*in a rather pointless attempt at good style, we ran a true loop: campsite to campsite rather than the usual east trailhead to west trailhead loop, adding a few kilometres)* 

We began the trail in a counterclockwise fashion, allowing early egress on day-hiking side trails should any nagging injuries rear their ugly head (such options do not exist after the first third of the trail). The goal was not to gun for a fast completion time, nor the vaunted FKT, but to get it done in good style and get back to camp without allowing misery to completely take over our day. 

Upon starting the trail proper, we immediately had to contend with the difficulty of navigating La Cloche’s characteristic mix of granite slab and deep forest by headlamp. After a brief acclimatization (and some fresh headlight batteries), we were well on our way to the Crack, travelling quickly on reasonably runnable terrain. We arrived at the top of the Crack at sunrise, where we were surprised and disheartened to see a number of hammock campers had spent the night.

The reality of the rest of the trail to come set in once we left the Crack. Terrain and trail conditions suitable to fast travel became a distant memory, replaced by sudden and relentless transitions between steep ascents and descents on generally very rocky, rooted singletrack. The mental concentration required to move quickly on such terrain proved to be the real crux of the day, as the challenge rarely let up from this point onward.

We were granted a short break in the form of a brief portion of runnable double-track on the way to the Silver Peak side trail junction. Feeling strong, adventurous, motivated and a little stupid, we elected in a split second decision to add the Silver Peak side trail to our loop. We ascended, tagged the summit, inhaled a few PB&amp;Js, and descended in well under and hour, and continued our loop. The views at the top were well worth the climb, as was the change of pace from the relentless mental grind of the rugged forest trails. While grateful for the brief diversion, we joked the added elevation might come back to haunt us.

The next 20 kilometres were as beautiful as they were relentless. Dangerously root-y forested sections were punctuated by stunning exposed granite ridges, which offered short glimpses of fast travel. The direct sun on the high slabs was punishing, but we were treated to the occasional refreshing northern gust of wind as we traversed the more exposed parts of the La Cloche high ridge. This section was perhaps most defined by the steep ascent up Moose Pass, where distant trail markers leered at us from above tall sections of exposed granite, with no clear path or direction other than “up”.

As we exited the Hansen Township section and entered Threenarrows, I had my first and thankfully only moment of deep-seated worry, as my outer thighs began threatening to cramp, causing my stride to stiffen. In turn, my now-awkward stride quickly brought on a sharp inner knee pain each time my left foot hit the ground. Thankfully, something in the cocktail of salt pills, ibuprofen and water I nervously sucked back kept the potential injury at bay. The potentially disastrous ramifications of an injury so far into the backcountry were jarring, despite the degree to which we had prepared for such a moment. To be 55 kilometres into an attempt to run the La Cloche loop is to be truly alone, and to be there worrying about injury without true shelter only made the feeling more exposed and sobering. 

The remainder of the run was blissfully uneventful, though our mental fortitude began to give way to regular distance check-ins and the occasional muttered complaint as we closed in on the final 20 kilometres back to camp. As we tired, turn-offs and trail markers were missed, backtracks were more frequent, and morale was tested. The terrain remained too technical to run with any consistency, forcing us to run where possible only to give up after a few hundred meters in favour of a feverish-yet-laboured power hike.

In the final few kilometres, familiar sights and the ever-closer promise of the comfort of our campsite kept the pace quick (or at least it felt quick at the time), and after a quick fist-bump on the bridge that marked the western trailhead, we speed-shuffled back to our distant campsite, quietly cursing our idealized full loop from campsite to campsite idea. We arrived back at camp 16 hours after we left for a total distance of 82.59 kilometres and a total elevation gain of a whopping 3,267 meters.

I can hardly remember eating dinner, and I certainly can’t remember falling asleep.

Yes, I would do it again.

**Thoughts on Gear**

On to the fun stuff. Gear selection for this attempt was subject to much scrutiny, but the final decisions proved to work in a general sense.

VJ Ultras were the shoe of choice for this run, given their ideal balance between cushion and ground feel and their emphasis on grip for potentially slick granite slab, wet roots, and classic Killarney clay-rich mud. They performed admirably – especially on wet terrain – despite my relative lack of experience with them (I had only put 50 kilometres on them prior to La Cloche). 

The Salomon Sense Pro 10 was the vest of choice for this run. A 10 litre capacity vest for an unsupported 80+ kilometre run was certainly a risk, but with careful packing and plenty stored in the front pockets, it proved adequately roomy. Comfort was excellent despite humid, sweaty conditions through a very long day on the trail. I used the standard Solomon soft flasks, topped with dual Salomon XA filters for quick water filtration on trail – this setup was crucial in order to minimize wasted time actively filtering water. I carried a third, empty Salomon soft flask in the main vest pocket to fill and carry through longer sections that were without reasonable expectation of water access, though this proved unnecessary and the third flask was never used.

Layers were simple, and brought to you by a well-timed Patagonia sale: A Patagonia Capilene baselayer, coupled with a (seldom-used) Airshed Pullover for wind and light precipitation. While shorts may not seem like a gear choice worthy of discussion, I should call out Patagonia’s now-discontinued Endless Run hybrid short/tight for stellar all-day comfort and truly excellent pockets. For long efforts like these, the chafe protection and ample storage make them worth the increased weight over a pair of split shorts. Fair warning – they look stupid as heck.

Nutrition was a case of “if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it”. Tailwind, stroopwafels and (caffeinated) Endurance Taps made up the bulk of my calorie intake. A peanut butter &amp; jam (no one likes jelly) sandwich and some salt &amp; vinegar cashews quelled palate fatigue and provided some much needed fat and salt, while a couple Snickers bars ended up being the star of the show – every full day out in the backcountry needs a snack that you actually look forward to consuming.

Safety gear took the form of a Garmin InReach, a single down puffy and Gore-Tex ShakeDry shell (each to be shared if needed), and a well-stocked first aid kit. Shelter was omitted by virtue of the excellent weather forecast, though I am well aware of the increased risk created by this decision.",1632676882
ultrarunning,FlyingSquirrel225,Training Plan Question,"Hi - hope this is not too specific of a question. Long time reader, first time poster -  I am training for my first ever ultra in February (60k) with another potential ultra in December (signed up for 50k but there is a 35k option).

I ran a half (not anything too fast, 9:30 mm) last weekend and felt fine during/immediately after, but have since had ankle pain that will not go away (wearing a compression sleeve around the house). I haven't run on it since last weekend but have to walk a decent amount where I live. I'm getting nervous that I have already skipped the first week of the training plan - will this be a problem? Any recommendations to get back on track and avoid overuse injuries?

&amp;#x200B;

More context:

* My longest training run so far is 16 miles at 10 mm pace, relatively flat terrain
* I have hiked quite a bit in the last year and am in strong hiking shape, unfortunately just moved to a new city where most of the trails are flatter but planning some hiking/trail running trips for the weekends",1632676824

ultrarunning,Freshlystallone,Failed at 100km..Feel terrible.,"Hey guys,

 I'm not sure this belongs here as I technically walked most of the route however yesterday I attempted the trailwalker 100 in the UK and failed and it stings like hell. Made it to 80km and not sure what happened to me, felt dizzee, nauseous, heart racing even at rest etc. The painful thing is my team mates went on to finish without me.

I'm jusy really looking for any similar stories and advice how to deal with failure. I absolutely hate myself right now and am not sure how to deal with it. Also, does anyone have an explanation as to what happened to me? Was it just lack of willpower? Did I not eat enough calories (my team we're eating constantly however I feel like I couldn't do that because of nauseous feeling)

Thanks very much.",1632649597

Winter is quickly approaching and I spend nearly every weekend snowboarding Friday night to Sunday night. My issue herein is how do y’all keep your base mileage relatively high but also have your weekends?

In my head and some training plans, people that do bigger and longer races, basically write off the weekends for back to back long runs. The better three quarters would kill me if I didn’t go to the mountains with her (I’m on thin ice with anything over a 6 hour run on a weekend).

ultrarunning,fire_foot,"Longest long run for first 50k, and hiking translations to running","Hi all, first post here, some questions that I'd really appreciate your help with:

What, would you say, is the minimum longest training run needed for a hilly 50k? Not seriously ‘racing’, but just wanting to get around and have fun as it’ll be my first ultra. On trails such as the one I’ll be racing I am about 14 minutes/mile, so I’m rounding that to 15 minutes and thinking an 8-8.5 hour finish is doable. Longest run so far is 20 miles (on a pretty easy trail), and I've had several 15+ milers on trails like what I will be racing on. 

Obviously, my long training runs take ages. Which I’m totally okay with. But I have three long runs left before I start tapering and I’m not quite hitting my plan so I’m wondering if hitting the marathon distance on a trail is critical or not. Between running and hiking (95% running) I have been around 40mpw for the past couple few months, which I feel like should be higher but oh well. For the next the long runs, I am thinking 22, 24, 26... thoughts?

Also, after my last long run, I will be going on holiday and doing a lot of hiking. I will also still be running (supposed to be around 30-35 miles that week). The hikes will be fairly intense mountain hikes in the northern Appalachians, probably no longer than 12 miles per hike though due to my old dog, but easily 2500-4000' gain. Due to less sunlight, traveling/driving places, being on holiday with boyfriend, hiking a lot, etc., I'm anticipating not being able to hit every single run and wondering how much this will hurt me? I go on holiday on the 10th, my race is on the 30th, so will a) hiking a lot and running some will be a nice way to taper or b) hiking will be nice but I need to hit all my runs?

ultrarunning,atxgossiphound,This community is great - Big thanks to everyone who helped me when I tripped attempting RRR!,"I made my second attempt at Run Rabbit Run 100 last weekend. The race was going well early on. I was generally feeling strong and on my target pace. It was hot in the mountains (low 80s) but I had been training in the heat in Texas all summer, so I thought things were fine.

As I rounded a switchback on the first major descent around mile 13 (just above upper Fish Creek Falls, if you know the course), I stumbled. I extended my leg to catch my balance and - BAM! - my calf seized up and I hit the rocks.

Without missing a beat, a nearby runner stopped to help me out. Once it was sure I was not seriously injured, he gave up a few minutes of his race pushing my foot back and forth to help work out the cramp, all while I'm cursing and moaning in agony (apologies to anyone who heard that echoing across the canyon). Throughout this, *every* runner that passed offered help in the form of salts, blocks, and moral support. Despite it looking like my race was over, everyone was willing to lose a little time or gear to make sure I was OK.

We worked out the worst of the cramp and after a little time sitting on the sidelines I managed to hobble down to the aid station. There, the nurse immediately noticed what was going on and came over and started massaging my calf while other volunteers brought me water and offered food (my stomach was not having food at that point). She spend a good portion of my stay there working it out with me (and the other cramped runners - there was a theme).

After a slow ascent with my muscles right on the edge of another cramp, I spent some more time at the next aid station (Long Lake) getting salts balanced. From there, I committed to see if I could make it.

The next sections were 5 miles of easy climbing up a road followed by 20 miles of downhill. I managed to get back on my target pace and gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, the few hours lost in recovery were the buffer I needed and I came into the midway aid station (Olympian) 5 minutes (!!!) past the cutoff. Even with the accident, I was still two hours ahead of my time from 2019 - a victory for me.

**Words cannot express how grateful I am for everyone's help.  In particular, if you're the guy who stopped and helped me work it out, the nurse and aid station volunteers, or the person who threw blocks at me despite my reluctance to accept, thank you! I would not have continued without your support!**

In hindsight, it's pretty clear that I miscalculated on salts and should have upped the amount as it started to heat up. Live and learn and on to the next one!",1632323026

### Training
I didn't follow a specific training plan or guide. But my weekely runs consisted of Wednesday hills/trails 4-6km, Friday road ~5km+, and easy long slow distances on Sundays with cross training in the gym tuesday and thursday mornings. I tried following a plan to train for this race in prior years, but I ended up getting injured and I really just didn't have it in me to run every single day. So training for this I decided to go at my own pace and actually quite enjoyed all of my runs.

I ended up driving out to the course and did 25km there as a trial run which was the longest distance I had done up to this. Initially I had planned to do 30-32km but the course was far more difficult that I realized. But spending 5+ hours on the course I learned quite a bit about what to expect. 

### Pre-race
In the days leading up to the event my anxiety was at an alltime high which resulted in me getting really poor sleeps. However, come race day, I was absolutely fired up and ready to go.

In my vest I carried two 500ml soft flasks. One with water, the other with Nuun. Stinger waffles, Huma gels, Fruit bars and candy. 

### Race
Conditions looked awful, 30-35 degrees celcius with 50km/hr+ winds or more. But more on that later. 

The first 20km was amazing. The hills are hard but fairly straightforward and there were plenty of relatively flat sections that allowed me to run at a comfortable and relaxed pace. The ~11km and ~16km aid stations were welcome sights but I was not quite desperate for them yet. 

The sun came out around the 20km mark and that’s where things went slowly downhill. 

I left the 23km aid station with 1L of water. The high heat with the harsh winds made hydration a real challenge. The wind feels nice because it kind of makes the heat of the sun feel not so bad, but it is a nasty trick. 

By 25km I was rationing water. One sip per 1km. I didn’t run as much because the more I ran, the more my body demanded water. I was desperate for the next aid station. I switched to technique I called “hiking with confidence”, it’s the walk you do when you’re at the airport kind of late on the way to the gate - but you’re not about to full blown run. 

Between 28-32km I decided to quit but changed my mind a few times. I arrived at the 32k aid station at 6hours 30mins. The wonderful team there dumped a bucket of ice water on my face and that changed everything. Suddenly I felt ready to go and figured I could slam the last 18km in just over 3 hours, but the damage was already done. 

I was still able to eat solids. Putting down a fruit to go bar, waffle, banana or energy gels more or less fine. But after this aid station I couldn’t run anymore. I believe I was just too dehydrated from the last leg. Whenever my heart rate elevated my stomach wanted to purge itself. Finishing today was not longer an option but I figured I could slog my way to the next aid station. 

The last leg I was more or less alone. And one of the sweepers (volunteers making sure nobody was left on the course) came up behind me and we walked it in to the 42k aid station together, it was nice to have some company. 

I was DNF’d at the last aid station at 9hours and 46 minutes. But really there was zero chance of me going back out there had they let me. 

It was the hardest thing I have ever done and I had such a fun time doing it. 


### Post-race

In summary:

Training / preparedness ✅
I felt I was prepared enough to finish. The heat just got to me so bad.

Nutrition ✅.
I was still able to eat solids and had a pretty good variety of foods

Hydration ❌.
More water.

Footwear ❌. 
My Saucony Peregrines ended up not being really all that comfortable after 25km. My left foot was falling asleep so I had to loosen the laces, but that created more movement. Blister city. 

Attitude / Mental health ✅. 
It sucked for sure but I was in high spirits for the most part. Really enjoyed it.

People ✅.
The people that run these races are the nicest people I have ever met. I love being a part of this sport.

Again? ✅. 
Absolutely. I need to finish next year.",1632257938
ultrarunning,Mookid94,Elevation Gain per Week,"Hello!  I’m training for my first ultra at the moment which is in 7 weeks.  The race is 50 miles with 3000 metres/10,000 ft of elevation gain on trail. 

I live in London so I’m not used to massive amounts of vertical when running so I have been conscious to focus on getting as much as I can.  However, I’m not exactly sure what to aim for?

I have been building up to (and last week I hit) 1,500 metres / 5,000 ft per week. The aim is to peak in 4 weeks with 3,000 metres / 10,000 ft.  Is that a good plan? Is that too much for the purposes of my race? Too little??

### About

BMM is held in June in a park near downtown Black Mountain, NC, on a 3.25 mile runnable trail loop (no, not up in the mountains ala Quest for the Crest, Seven Sisters, etc). After some serious flooding a few years ago the course was altered slightly in 2021, lengthening from 5km to 3.25mi and the start/finish was moved to a better location. No real vert, maybe 100-200ft/lap. There are 6, 12, and 24 hr options.

### Training

I’ve only been running ultra distance for two years with a handful of 50ks and one self-supported 50 miler under my belt. For the buildup for this one, in the spring I raced a 50k in Raleigh and crashed hard in some unexpected (for early April) 80 degree heat. I was huffing it in the last 8-9 miles and vomiting. Not a fun one. I learned a lot from that crash that came in handy for BMM re: heat and nutrition prep. (That’s the point of buildup races, right!) A few weeks later I ran/hiked the Black Mountain Crest Trail out and back (23 miles 8,000ft vert) with a buddy which was a really helpful training run in terms of time on feet + vert. Peak training was between 55-65mpw with weekend moderately long back-to-backs, the last of which was 21 and 17 miles. I was in a positive space coming into the race. Of course there is always a bit of “could I have done more?” but in general I felt ready to roll. My goal for the race was to get between 55-60 miles in these 12 hours and place Top 10. If the weather really broke for us (which, spoiler alert, it did not) my stretch goal was 100k. My bottom-of-the-barrel, wheels-come-off goal was a distance PR (over 50mi). 

### Race
The day was shaping up to be sunny, hot, and humid. I grew up in these mountains and I would describe it as a standard summer day. 80 and sticky. When the gun went off (10am start) many went out fast but I was determined to hang back.

The middle of the day really started to take its toll on the field fairly quickly. Everyone slowed significantly. (What is mentally tricky about looped races like these is that the 6, 12, and 24 hour runners were all on the same loop simultaneously so it was impossible to ‘run off’ other people unless you peeked at their bib. Overall I just tried to ignore others and run my own race. When the 6 hour guys finished it was a lot easier to avoid chasing.) Slowly I was finding a rhythm around the course. 

My plan for our personal aid tent each loop was to ‘blow through’ every time (less than 30 seconds), only stopping for a cold water douse and water refill. Then every 15 miles (3x in the race) I would stop for 3-5 minutes to regroup for a bit and fill up on food. And that’s exactly how it worked out minus one extra 2-3 minute stop I took around mile 20. It was hot out there. Many were commenting their stomachs were struggling. Mine was as well (I had a hard time with gels) but not nearly as much as others, it seemed. My wife was awesome at quickly switching out water bottles, dousing my buff in ice water, ice down the arm sleeves, etc. I’m a lucky man. My 3 little girls were a fun morale boost as well, running 50-100 yards with me out of the aid station each loop and ‘helping’ mom. Looped ultras are a real benefit in this way. Crews are able to stay in the same spot and then we all get into a nice rhythm at each stop that point-to-points can’t do.

Even though I was already feeling pretty good all things considered, it was after 50k/~6hrs was when things started to come together really nicely. I put together some solid laps and gained a few more spots. The lead male dropped with an injury. (Sorry, man!) Roughly mile 40-45 I moved up into 4th but, most importantly, was in a great headspace for the last few hours. As the day cooled off, things continued to click. Even effort, no real low spots. Gels never went down well, but Bugles (yes, shout-out to America’s finger hats), watermelon, and pierogis went down nicely. 

At 52 miles I did a little math on the fly and figured out I could complete two more laps and still get in under 12 hours. Finished in 11:50ish with 58.5 miles. 18 laps.

Shoutout to all the finishers. I yoyo’ed quite a bit with the 24hour female eventual winner and was so impressed with some of the 24 hour folks running what was my 12 hour pace. Great athletes out there, way to go everybody. I would recommend this race to others. Well-organized and a fun environment with all the tents and personal aid stations along the course. And definitely a chance to go for an ultra PB that is still on trail but less technical/vert. 

### Post-race
A) Recovery: was feeling great by Wednesday or Thursday.  Except for a gnarly toenail blister I escaped this race without any issues. (Edit: a few weeks later I aggravated some ITB issues which have persisted) B) Aggressive heat management really helped me out. Even though 80 degrees isn’t exactly western states, I’d learned at the 50k in April that I’m a pretty below-average heat runner and need to be more aggressive than most and not overcook it early. Switching out ice cold buffs and hats and stuffing ice in the buff, sleeves, and belt seemed to do the trick for me. C) Looped courses can be an exciting test if you relish the challenge of ‘figuring out’ a course and want to grow mentally to overcome the monotony. I found it fascinating.

### Gear/eats
Nike Pegasus trail 2 (great for non-tech trail like this though my toes ran out of room towards the end of the race), darn tough socks, some cheap amazon arm sleeves, Garmin 945, petzl iko core for the last 90 minutes in the dark, Naked running belt with Salomon flasks, tailwind, Clif gels, pierogis, bugles, mountain dew, and watermelon.

### Training
 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

### Race
 
The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!


The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”


With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 


At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.


I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn’t affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‘move slowly and eat a lot’ strategy would pay off.


As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.


The third lap started well, and I saw another couple of headlamps that were on the back half of the loop which continued to grow my confidence. I was moving well in the rain for the first 20 minutes on the shale paths and asphalt, but then I came to the first climb of the lap. I couldn’t get up the first 10 foot section, as the rain had turned the trail into a slip and slide. After failing to get any traction on the trail for a few tries, I realized the only way up was to hike on the side of the trail, climbing with my hands when necessary. It was still slippery off the trail, but I could make slow progress. As I came over the top of the long, slow climb and into the descent, I realized that running was out of question. I tried to surf down the trail, however I would pick up speed quickly and fell a few times on this first descent alone.


At the bottom of the hill I realized that I had a new problem; my hands were covered in mud and I was running out of places to wipe them off. This meant that eating would be difficult. I tried to eat some of my snacks with some difficulty before deciding to wear my gloves while running. This way the gloves would get dirty, and I could take them off to eat. In practice my hands just got dirty messing around with my gloves so nothing really got solved.


The rest of the loop was a complete slog. The trails were either flooded or so slick it felt like running on ice. Despite moving slower than I had all race, I was using far more energy and was quickly becoming tired. The descents were the toughest part, with multiple falls and butt slides on each one. During one of the falls I tweaked my knee; I knew I could still run with it on solid ground but on the slippery trails it seemed like I was just asking for an injury. 


As the loop came to an end I had made a decision; if the directors had changed to the wet weather course (all gravel and shale) I would finish the race, but if I had to continue to run on trails then I would have to stop. As I came into the aid station I asked about the situation and was given two options: I could either wait around for ~2.5 hours while they collected runners that were stranded on the course and set up the wet weather loop, or I could take a 100 km finish now. My first thought was that a 100 mile race with a 2.5 hour rest didn’t seem very fair (to the race course? I don’t know, I was tired) as I would have time to regain my energy and refuel. Shortly after thinking this I realized that after a break that long I wasn’t sure I would be able to move at all, and I would need to be constantly moving during the break to ensure that my legs didn’t seize up. On top of that I wasn’t sure how my hurt knee would fare either. After a couple minutes of internal debate, I went over to the timing table and let them know I would take a 100 km finish. My final totals were 114.8 km in 21:56, and the race gave me an official 100 km finish (actually 108 km) of 20:07.


I left the timing table and walked through the finish line. I raised my hands and I think someone cheered. It certainly wasn’t the finish I was expecting and it felt incredibly anti-climactic. I was a bit jealous of the 100 km runners that were running down the final stretch triumphantly to scattered cheers. I sat around for a bit, texting the people who were following my race and chatting with runners that were making it back. Stories of people hitching rides in cars, losing equipment or bushwhacking to the closest aid station made me feel a bit better about my own muddy adventure. Once I heard back from my wife and knew I could get into my hotel room, I made the slow, cold 1 km walk back to the hotel.


Overall I’m a little disappointed with the result. I went to Lethbridge to run 100 miles, and have no doubt that had the trails held up I could have done it under the cut-off time. I held back on my second lap in preparation for a third lap I didn’t get to run, so it doesn’t really feel like a true 100 km effort either. On the other hand, running 115 km in my first ultra is something I can be proud of, and I’m excited to use the experience I gained in the future.

\### Training

 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

 

The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!

The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”

With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 

At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not.

ultrarunning,pysouth,Powerlifting programming while training for a 55k?,"I’m doing a 55k in December. My goal is really just to finish, I don’t care about being competitive with anyone but myself. I’m running about 40MPW but will hopefully be hitting around 50MPW deeper into the training cycle.

Currently I’m also running NSuns. I was doing 5 day, then moved to 4 day to give myself another running-only day. I’m starting to feel my lifts become much harder as I bump mileage up and add in speed work here and there. My caloric intake has been in a slight surplus and I’m getting 8+ hours of sleep every night.

I did unfortunately cut my last 4 weeks of training shorter than I would have liked due to recovering from covid so admittedly I don’t have loads to taper off, but more just making sure my body has recovered from being ill too. 

I have just started back at work in a very physical job, picking up and lifting heavy things, lots of walking, physical labour etc, will this be okay to continue doing a week before race day? 

Feel a bit tired currently but hoping the 11 days of taper freshens me up, but I do still have a few work shifts.",1631619672
ultrarunning,blladnar,Crazy foot issues. Anyone ever see or experience anything like this?,"Yesterday I finished the Teanaway Country 100. After about 40 miles I felt a bubble on the bottom of my heal. It almost felt like I was wearing some nike shoes with the huge bubbles on them.

I checked it out at an aid station and it was so deep that you couldn't even tell there was a blister there. Since there was nothing obvious to do about it I kept running. 

At about mile 60 I noticed this happening on my other foot and the original blister was spreading so it felt like most of my heal was a giant blister.

As the race continued it got worse and worse eventually spreading to the entire bottoms of my feet. The best way I can describe it is like I was wearing socks made out of my own skin. 

On downhills my feet would slide to the front of my ""sock"" and then they'd slide back as soon as the ground evened out. This was, as you can imagine, very uncomfortable. Any uneven ground or rock caused my foot to shift in its own skin, sometimes with extreme pain. At one point I thought my sock had fallen down my ankle into my shoe. It wasn't my sock, it was the skin of my foot rolling up.

Here's a photo. Warning, these feet grossed out the seasoned ultra runners at the finish line.  
https://imgur.com/a/9osyO8V

ultrarunning,Pro_Noobius,First 50k in April 2022,"Every year I try to do something new that challenges my mind and body. In the past, I’ve run a marathon, done an Olympic triathlon, and a 3-day 75 mile backpacking trip. My goal is to eventually do a 50-mile run. 
A little about myself: I’m 42 yrs old, 5’11” 200lbs. I do not have a “runner’s body.” I work for UPS so I have a very active job. I get between 15k-20k steps a day. Right now I can go run 8-10 miles on demand @ about a 10:00 min pace. I’m not a runner that wants to podium. I’m more interested in just doing the best I can and completing the event. I also mountain bike on the weekends. 
With this in mind, I’m looking for advice regarding all aspects of a 50k trail run. Everything from: nutrition during and after the runs (I sweat ALOT and can get headaches if I don’t drink/eat enough; and I don’t ever feel the difference if I eat Gus or gels), training schedules (looking for something that will mesh with my ups job) and clothing (right now I wear basketball shorts and quick dri UA or Nike shirts; because I sweat a lot these can get uncomfortable. I’ve been looking at the Exoskin line of compression wear). I ran my marathon in basketball shorts and ate whatever they had at the aid stations (which I regret). 
It’ll be hard to train daily as I put in about 9-12hrs a day at work. November and December will be nearly impossible to train except on the weekends. Christmas season will be 14hr days. 
I want to start training now so I can slowly build up to April. If I wait until 3 months before the run then I’m afraid that’ll be too much, too quick on my body and I’ll injure myself.

Unfortunately it took me way longer to recover from that race, considering it was really just part of my 100 mile training block. Since that race, my motivation has just been sucking lately. 

Honestly, I hate running right now, it doesn’t seem fun anymore. I really just want to move on and lift weights again (my first love is CrossFit type lifting, and I pulled back on it to run more).

As of now I'm not training for any ultra or trail race or event but hope to once I've got a good base.  

Hoping to either design myself or find an easy online plan that can help me slowly ramp up to a good 30+ miles per week base that mixes all or some of road, trail, speed, slow/long runs, strength, xt, hills/elevation gain, etc.  

Anyone successfully done this before?  Looking for either some tips, easy guidance, or any sort of online training plan that may work well for ultra/trail runners, but is not specific for an event or race.   

Seems most of the online running plans are tailored toward a specific distance event, but I'm hoping for something that focuses more on creating and maintaining a base.

My main concern was finishing before the cutoff, and I beat it comfortably by 45 minutes.

It could not have gone any better for my first 50.

ultrarunning,Rallih_,What watch to buy? Restricted budget,"Hi all,

What watch do you recommend for a fellow Ultrarunner to buy? My budget is 300-400€. I would like to pay less. I don't need to fancy functions. I think a battery time is one of the most important in comparison to data.   


I have looked at:  
Garmin Instinct Solar  
My eye caught this due to it looks. The brain due to it's price and battery. I really like it. But - it is missing the VO2 estimation, recovery data etc. I am not sure if this will bother me or not. GPS and wrist HR works good on this model. I will not have to care so much about battery due to its battery saving tweaks when running 12-24 hours runs.  
Price for a new is 235€. An amazing price I would say for a new Garmin watch.

Coros Pace 2  
Battery monster as well, cheap and alot of data. I can get this for 170€, new. What I do not like is it's ecosystem (I do not know anything about it). I don't know so much about how much I can tweak the battery usage. But as I understand I should be able to run 12-24 hours easily. I think it says 30? hours in GPS-mode. Downside is that it's only offered in white. I am not sure I really like that color on my wrist 24/7. Any reviews on this watch here from other ultra runners that are in this ecosystem already?

Suunto Spartan Ultra  
An old Suunto, that I actually already own. It's ok and it has the data I need for running. But yea, the battery starts getting old and I am not really comfortable with the ecosystem and I'm having a bit trouble tweaking the battery to get out more than 16 hours from this when running. That is a big issue for me before next season when running up to 24 hours. But maybe I've missed some settings?  


Is there any other watches that I should look at? And no, an old used Fenix I am not interested of.",1631261903

Any Ultra Runners here using the Garmin Instinct Solar?

\### Training

I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

\### Pre-race

Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

\### Race

There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them \~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

\### Post-race

Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

ultrarunning,LordSaddler,Is it dumb to sign up for an ultra at my level of experience?,"So I've been running (mainly trail and fell) consistently for the last 2.5 years. My furthest run has been a 30k with about 1000 metres of elevation. When I finished that, I felt like I could definitely have carried on of it wasn't for my feet being sore from tendonitis. Small injuries and niggles are what have been stopping me from breaking into that marathon/ultra territory and I feel like everytime I try to increase my distances (even when very gradually), I get a small injury which sets me back a week or so. I've been to physios and tried to improve my form a lot but I can't seem to avoid these minor setbacks.

I'm now considering just saying f it and signing up for a trail ultra in November of this year. It's about 60k (3 laps of a course that I'm very familiar with) and around 1500m of elevation. Since I've started taking running seriously, I've known I definitely want to eventually do ultras. So I want to get the first one under my belt soon.

Is this a really dumb idea? I know it'll be painful but I know I could do it if I just go really slowly and steadily. I'm sick of progressing a little bit and then falling back to square one.",1631175565

ultrarunning,scrimbibbly,Beginner’s luck and beginner’s misfortune: the Grand Traverse,"September 4th, 2020
Crested Butte to Aspen
40.5 miles

First ultra in the books! Thank you to all those in this sub who helped answer the questions I had along the way. 

The beginning: 
We started the day just before sunrise at 6am, winding our way around the base of Mount Crested Butte with views of the foggy valley below peeking out between Aspen groves. My running partner and I were feeling great, riding high on the energy of race day. We had signed up for the Grand Traverse spur-of-the-moment back in May, inspired by a particularly fun day of trail running. We are not inexperienced runners, but brand new to ultras and both coming off long breaks from running. We had trained hard all summer and were excited to see what we were capable of now that we had finally reached the start line. I knew we were both a bit undertrained given our short training period, but fully believed that we were both capable of finishing. 

Four miles in, my running partner stumbled and tripped, her arms flying out in front of her. I had done the same thing a couple weeks earlier, ending up with a nasty bruise on my knee that had mostly stopped aching in time for race day. I figured she’d be dealing with a nice scrape and bruise too, but nothing she couldn’t run through. She hopped up and turned towards me, and I felt the color leave my face. Instead of blood, I saw the white of fatty tissue and bone. She cried out in shock and stumbled backwards off the trail. A couple that had been just behind us immediately offered their assistance, pulling out a much more equipped med kit than my own. Another runner who happened to be a nurse stepped in to help as well. I was so appreciative for these kind and selfless people who I knew were giving up precious time. Fortunately, we still had service and I contacted race support, figuring out how we could get my friend off the trail and down the nearest road. After our new friends had her wound sufficiently compressed, she and I began a slow journey back the way we had came, towards a trail that would lead us down towards a service road. We were both heartbroken, knowing that the day had ended before it had even really began. We ran into the sweep along the way and explained what had happened and where we were headed. Ten or so minutes later, he appeared back behind us on the trail. “Hey, I just spoke to race support, and they said that you should continue on if you’d like. I can help your friend the rest of the way down.” I looked back and forth between the sweep and my friend. “Go!” she yelled. “Are you sure?” “Yes, go!!” Well, I thought, this is not the way either of us pictured the day, but I had to at least try. I took off back the way we’d came, trying to move as fast as I could while knowing that I risked burning myself out. I was at least 45 minutes behind the last group of runners, and I was going to be cutting it close to making the first cutoff at 11:15am at the top of Star Pass. I had to push the pace, otherwise there was no point in continuing on. I knew I was going to be lucky to pull this off, but I was so grateful for the opportunity to continue and I had to try. 

I only saw one other runner in the span of almost an hour, and my doubts continued to grow. Before the first aid station, a supporter with a giant sombrero and a cowbell cheered me on. “How far behind do you think I am?” I asked. “Don’t worry about that, you just run your own race!” “No really, how far behind am I?” “You just run your own race, this is about you!”  Yikes, I thought. While I did appreciate the sentiment, there was clearly no hope for me. I was too far behind. I kept pushing, finally passing two other women at the first wet stream crossing at Brush Creek just before Aid 1, 9.5 miles in. A handful of other runners were still at the station, and I breathed a small sigh of relief knowing that I was finally starting to catch up. I just had to keep moving forward.

The middle: 
As I left the aid station, the knee I had bruised a couple weeks prior seized up. I limped my way along. Great, I thought. Not even 10 miles in and it’s already giving me problems. There’s no way I can make it if this doesn’t let up. But, sure enough, it loosened back up and I was feeling good again. It stiffened up every time I stopped moving throughout the day, but the pain was always temporary. 

I moved through Death Pass escarpment onto East Brush Creek jeep road, where I slowly began to pass other runners. It wasn’t long before the trail started to slowly ascend towards Star Pass. By this time, I had caught up to the couple that had supplied their med kit and helped take care of my friend. I kept pace just behind them, finally feeling like I had a good chance of making the Star Pass cutoff. I followed them all the way to the top of the pass, making the cutoff with 30 minutes to spare. We chatted for awhile as we descended the pass, and I let them know how thankful we were for their help. I had 2 hours to make it 6 miles to the next cutoff at mile 23.5, the summit of Taylor Pass, and I had regained much of my confidence by this point. I was still feeling strong and had managed to avoid any stomach or feet issues, my two worries. 

I powered through to Taylor Pass, once again arriving 30 minutes before the cutoff. I restocked what I needed to from my drop bag and headed towards Richmond Ridge.  There were no more cutoffs after this. I could see the Maroon Bells just behind another mountain range to my left. I knew I was going to make it. I kicked my hiking muscles into gear and moved up and over Richmond Ridge, realizing part way up that I had just completed my first marathon. 

I rolled in to Aid 4 at mile 29. I had 11 miles to go. I could feel some blisters beginning to form between my big toes. I should have reapplied Aquaphor after the last wet crossing, but it was too late now. I kept moving. I was finally beginning to feel the weight of the day. I moved through much of the next 5 miles alone, finally catching up to some other runners as we got closer to Aid 5. This gave me the motivation I needed to pick up the pace. I was getting so close. 

The end: 
I reached the final aid station at the top of Aspen mountain at 3:30pm. I knew that this final stretch was supposed to be brutal, descending 3,200 feet over five miles. The knowledge that was actually going to cross the finish line spurred me on, and I bombed it downhill as fast a I could without completely destroying my quads or risking a wipe out. At this point, the blisters were finally starting to get to me but it really didn’t matter. I was going to make it. Those 5 miles seemed to keep going and going, and the trail got steeper and steeper to the point where I almost wanted to scoot down on my butt in certain sections. It was the only time during the day where I wished I had poles. 

Finally, I rounded the corner into Ajax Park, almost exactly 10 hours and 30 minutes from when we’d started. My husband, my now patched-up friend, and her boyfriend were awaiting me. My friend and I immediately embraced. It was a bittersweet ending to a journey that we had started together and had planned to end together. I knew I would never have even made it the start line had it not been for her, and I had channeled her throughout the day all the way through to the finish line. I felt so grateful to have made it there and for the incredible support system waiting for me. Fortunately, while she did need plenty of stitches, my friend’s injury didn’t damage any bones or tendons. I know she’ll be back up and running in no time at all, and there will be mountains waiting for her. 

TLDR: Trained hard for the Grand Traverse. Four miles in, I thought both myself and my running partner were both done for thanks to a perfectly placed rock and an unlucky fall. After getting my friend to safety, I was given the opportunity to continue but didn’t know if I could catch up in time to make the cutoffs. Managed to reach the cutoffs in time and make it across the finish line! I know my friend will get her opportunity to do the same.",1631033955
ultrarunning,djc0,Maintaining “form” while running so slowly,"In the last few years I’ve gone from easy runs at 5:45/km pace to 8:00/km pace (reasons in my post history, not relevant here).

worried about developing a chronic injury.

Foot landing under centre-of-mass is the main one I follow (true at any pace). Any others you’ve found help transition to slow (aka zone 2) running?",1630969565

I've been running about 65-70 mpw pretty consistently as part of preparation for an upcoming Ironman (also biking 15 or 16 hours per week and swimming 20k or so per week). Every Sunday I put in a SLOW 4-5 hour long run (25-30 miles), and it's my favorite day of the week. Every time I go out the door it's hard for me to stop. Running far makes me happiest, so I've been thinking about switching from faster, more frequent runs to longer ones two or three days a week; last Sunday I went 28, then I put in 25 on Wednesday. Tomorrow I've got my long brick workout, so I'll run for an hour after a seven-hour bike, and then put in my usual 4-5 hour run on Sunday. Is anybody else distributing their mileage similarly? It seems like most ultramarathoners go that long much less frequently; am I setting myself up for an injury? So far, no niggles to speak of.

ultrarunning,fourandthree,Overtraining at low mileage?,"I sprained my ankle really badly last fall and took a few months off running to actually do my physio exercises, then started building back my base by following a half-marathon training plan, with the intention to use that as my first training block before starting back into my ultra training plan (which starts at around 50km/week) with the eventual goal of a 50M next spring. I've previously used this training plan for a 55km and a 65km race successfully (""success"" defined here as ""finishing without injury,"" not ""smashing course records"").

I was feeling strong and powerful until I hit about 30km/week in July. This was right about the time it got crazy hot and humid here, so I decided to take a few easy weeks, because I could definitely feel myself struggling and my paces were getting slower, along with my HR getting much higher. I did a few weeks of 30km mileage, then took a two-week break due to a vacation (though subbed in lots of paddling and hiking). 

Now, however, fall has hit, the air is crisp, and here I am struggling to run a 10k on relatively flat roads. My legs feel like they're made of lead, and my HR makes me look like I'm an overweight smoker in my 80s instead of a relatively fit 35 y/o (though I acknowledge that since I'm using a wrist sensor this isn't necessarily super-accurate).

Is it possible that I ramped up too fast post-injury? Did I have asymptomatic COVID that damaged my heart? Has some prankster filled my shoes with ball bearings?

I have had a pretty solid training block (averaging 100km per week) but recently my glute has been giving me grief mid-run. After grinding through it several times, I opted to rest this week and have been to see a physio. He reckons it's just *very* tight, so gave me a deep tissue massage, recommended I take some more time off, and try running again in a day or two.

Mentally, I am struggling with the situation and the loss of miles this week. I know that this close to race day, it's near impossible to improve - I constantly tell myself this, but doubt continues to creep in. I guess this is the norm, but some reassurance would be appreciated.

I am also a little anxious that my first couple of runs back are a disaster and there is no improvement. Two weeks on the exercise bike doesn't sound like a great taper to me.

ultrarunning,spon0039,Help with estimating how much water I should bring,"Hi all, I have a question about estimating how much water I should bring with me on a solo 100K I'm planning. Basically, I'm looking at attempting an FKT (unsupported) along a flat rail-to-trail line. The route only has something like 600 ft of vertical gain (gross) over the full distance and will have net elevation loss, so it's quite flat. 

Since this is the first time I'll be attempting this distance without support, I'm wondering how I should estimate my hydration needs. **Are there ways to calculate how much water I'd need per hour or per mile?** I have time to test hydration equations.

A Google search didn't yield reliable information – One blogger recommended 1L per hour, which seemed excessive and would be too much for me to carry. And I can't really go off of any race experience as I often re-fill my flasks at every opportunity as a precaution. 

Some additional details that may help:

* Looking to run later this fall in cooler weather (shooting for highs in the 50s F)
* I'm estimating the run will take me about 12 hours without support
* I regularly run marathon distances with just two 750 ml soft flasks
* Not concerned with nutrition as I have a pretty good grasp of how many calories I need per hour to keep moving

If needed, I could pull off the run and purchase water from one of the towns the route goes through, which would bump the attempt to the self-supported category. This would be okay but I'd like to try and carry it all with me if I can.

I recognize we all have different needs, but I don't really know where to even start with estimations. Should I just triple what I normally take for a 25ish mile run?

- Packing around 3-4k calories, mix of sweet potatoes, pb&amp;j sandwiches, trail mix, gummy bears, protein+granola bars, electrolyte tablets, drink mix. Any other good items to pack and bring? We can also get some real food somewhere in the middle right?

I increased my milage way too much. Nobody ever told me the price for an injury was a ruined life. I thought it would at max be a year recovery. Not permanent damage. Not a meniscus repair that gives me arthritis, that then needs a knee replacement, that leads to agony and immobility later in life.

I can't fucking believe that this is happening to me.

The doctor thinks it's a meniscus injury. I've been off for 4 months from running. My knees are only getting worse. I fear that the tear is worsening. I'm going to call in to speed up the MRI, because 8 weeks isn't enough.

I fear that at best, I'll need to trim to meniscus, causing me to lose my knees eventually.

The pain onset was gradual, but as I was 10 odd mile from the finish I hobbled on and literally limped over the line I real pain. I distinctly remember that the pain was far worse when walking, and seemed to subside when running, hence why I kept running! I ended up in A&amp;E the nex day, told it was not broken, but was in a boot and off work for two weeks. The pain was a few inches above the ankle on the front of my leg, lower shin area. 

Fast forward many years and this injury is a distant memory with many races done since. But this weekend I was 46 miles into another ultra when I felt a instant, yet mild pain in the same place. I knew it was back. Right enough when I stopped running it was worse, and running make it better, but then the subsequent stop was worse. Knowing how this story goes I called it a day and pulled out from the race.

A few days later and I have no pain walking whatsoever, but just three inches above my ankle, just to the right of the bone is area tender when I press with my finger.  When I tense the muscle however, the tenderness dissapears!

I’ve done some yoga in the past, but often feel like I don’t get enough training benefit from it (stretching and mobility, though, it’s brilliant), but I also feel like I need a little bit more fun than just strength exercises in the living room after the kid is tucked in. 

Is there some good internet resource where I can find, say, five different 20 minute yoga practices that I can do as my  strength, conditioning and mobility routine? Anyone that’s had good results/experiences with something similar?

ultrarunning,Accomplished_Goat448,The little story of my 50km trail race after 2 months of bad training,"Ok I know a 50km run is barely considered as ultra running, but

I never ran in my life

Did olympic weightlifting as a teen and got good , started breaking local records.

I also got into bodybuilding after and bulked up for 86kg for 177cm

Then i got interested into alpinism and running

My first run session was about 2km in 25 minutes with lot of pain everywhere, still weighing 85kg and with sneaker 

Second session I did 20 kilometers in 2h30 minutes.
It was a flat trail '

Then i got injured 5 months ago.
 Couldnt run nor walk without pain  for 2 months so i stopped everything and dropped weight to 73kg

Then i a ran a little bit, like 10km in 1h30 wich was bad but only because i had weird pain in  my Calf

During the last 3 months, I have never ran more than   5km continuously  because of pain everywhere

One day I managed to run 8km in 40 minutes

Then i took a break to walk in the alps
Only 2 running training here

I was back in town, absolutely no serious training and never Ran more than 15km since my bad 20km run before my big injury. 

i have done 4 or 5 painfull run during this time and injured myself in high tight

But two days ago, after being impressed by killian Jornet, I decided that today I was going to run 50km. 

I still had my thight injury but i felt great 

Ran the 30 kilometers in 3 hours 12 minutes, 

Ran the 41 kilometers in 4 hours 25 minutes

And ran the 50 kilometers in 5 hours 30 minutes with

 two 10 minutes breaks  and multiple 20 seconds breaks 

I felt good, and i could hold the 10 kilometers per hour for hours, but my tight injury Prevented me from doing so, but that's no excuse, I don't think I could have done better. I ran low pace, breathing was easy, everything was good.


But i only took 4 little bottle of 90g of mashed apple  wich represent 20g of carbs per bottle wich is not a lot
. Since i had no running kind of backpack. 

I think I would have needed 200 calories of carbohydrate per hour. 


I really think if i managed to do a 50km run in a OK time without any proper training in just 3 months post  big  injury, I'm on the right path 

And yes, it was a mistake to run this far without proper training or anything. I'm not going to do it again for a while. 

In addition, as I had no water on me, I had to stay close to a tap, which forced me to do trail running on the same trail  circuit for 5 hours. 

And i couldnt run uphill or downhill because of my tight injury, Fortunaly i am near Paris and the highest point is 200m. 
What do you think? If i made mistakes, im sorry, im french.",1630316574
ultrarunning,pooze12,First 50 mile. Training run has me concerned.,"Hello,

I have a 50 mile ultra in ~1 month. The vert on it is about 6,000 ft. I did a training run yesterday (long run day) which was 21 miles with about 6,000 ft. At the end of it I was dead. The run was three loops up to a peak and I walked the uphills  and ran the downs as much as I could (really no flats). The third loop I could not stay in zone 2, even on the downs. 

My long run before this was 28 miles with 4k vert and I didn't feel nearly as dead. And doubled up the next day for another 10 miles. 

Should this concern me? 

Thanks in advance.",1630276336
ultrarunning,beaudusseault,Salomon adv skin 5,"Thoughts anyone? I recently bought the Salomon Advanced Skin 5L hydration vest. I got it for an upcoming 50k (first ultra for me, hopefully many more to come). 

I love the pockets and stretchy fabric, but here are two things I’ve noticed and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

1) I am struggling getting it to really dial in fit-wise. Mainly an issue when I use the front two water bottle pockets. That weight seems to make it bounce. I have to really pull the cord to make the chest tight but nothing seems to really settle it in. Based on measurements I am a medium but not far from a small. Wondering about smaller size?

2) even more important, it seems that my favorite running shirts are getting messed up. Specifically the front right chest area. It doesn’t feel abnormal to my hands, but it seems that maybe the rubbing of the material on my shirts is running them raw, so to speak, right behind where the water bottle is. I don’t know if it’s an issue without the front water, but I feel that shouldn’t matter.

## Training

My qualifying races were from way back in 2017 and 2018 and I wasn't selected when I applied for 2020. Thanks to COVID, I had another chance to be selected in the lottery. I only really started to train for the race when I got in through the lottery in January.

I started with short daily runs in January, but I ramped up to 100km per week by May. I also went to Chamonix for a couple of weeks of proper training and I went hiking in the Alps.

I ran an ""easy"" 80km trial race with 1500m of elevation at the beginning of July, but I had to DNF because of tendinitis below my knee. I didn't want to waste my chance to participate in the CCC, so I dropped my mileage in July and did a bit of hiking in early August to try and make up for it.

Because I don't live anywhere near hills, I ran most mileage on pretty flat paths and roads. 

To give some perspective of my general running fitness, I run 19:30 for 5km and I did one 20km training run with 1300m of gain loss in 3:10.

## Pre-race

Of course, like everyone else in Chamonix, I was shocked and saddened to hear that a fellow runner died on the TDS course. The volunteers do so much to make the courses as safe as possible, but these races are still high in the Alps and can be dangerous. 

I raced the OCC at the UTMB in 2017 and finished in the top 600 out of 2000 starters, so I thought that I could finish the CCC in a similar position or in about 22 hours. My training and fitness was pretty similar. However, I was placed in the final, fifth wave of runners because I effectively don't have an ITRA ranking. This means that to reach my goal of finishing in 22 hours, I would need to pass more than 1,000 people, which is a serious challenge given that the whole race is primarily on steep, mountain single track.

I also had a couple of other disadvantages. My girlfriend was visiting family, so she couldn't be there in person to crew me (Crews are allowed at every big aid station from Lac Champex on). I also picked the wrong shuttle time from Chamonix, so I had to wake up 5 hours before my race started.

Basically, my training, injury status, crew, and sleep were all suboptimal for a race of this magnitude. 

## Race

**Start to Tête de la Tronche - 0km to 9km**

I started about 3/4 back in the last wave or behind roughly 1900 other runners. I did manage to pass a lot of people in the first kilometers of the race. I heard that there can be a long wait for the first climb and I was expecting the worst given that I was starting in the final wave. As expected, I spent a lot of time standing around and not moving - at least 45 minutes. However, this might have been beneficial because when I got to the top I felt fresh, even if I heard others wheezing around me.

**Tête de la Tronche to La Fouly - 9km to 40km**

The next section was downhill, flat and pretty fast, but the huge number of runners meant that it was easy to get caught up in a slowish line. Going uphill to Col Ferret meant another conga line, if not as bad as the first. I passed over 100 people between Col Ferret and Anouvaz alone.

Unfortunately, I was having stomach pain through this section and I was really not eating enough calories. At the first aid station in Bertone at 15km, I felt like I could barely eat and I didn't get much better by Anouvaz. Nevertheless, I passed more than 350 people total from the start when I reached La Fouly on the descent - the equivalent of nearly every single person in front of me in my wave.

**La Fouly to Lac Champex - 40km to 55km**

This downhill section flew by. I passed another 100 people and hit the half way point in 10 hours. In fact, I was only about 30 minutes behind schedule for a 22:00 hour finish at Lac Champex. However, on the short climb up to Lac Champex, I was starting to feel weak.

**Lac Champex to Trient - 55km to 70km**

People started suffering at Lac Champex, me included. I stopped for over 20 minutes here because I felt woozy and I called my girlfriend for moral support before I started the race at night. The continued lack of food caused me to absolutely struggle on the climb up to La Giete. When I finally reach the water station at La Giete, I sat down for another 20 minutes and ate as many calories as I could stomach. The medic came by and asked if I needed help. I was really showing it and quite a few people passed me here. I was now more than an hour behind 22 hour pace. 

Luckily eating gave me enough of a boost to get moving again and I actually passed a few people on the descent to Trient.

**Trient to Vallorcine - 70km to 81km**

I got sucked in at Trient and I stopped 30 minutes without realizing it. I put my headphones in to help distract myself when I left. The climb was still slow and I still wasn't eating enough, but I had convinced myself that it would be gravy once I reached the top. In Vallorcine, as soon as I sat down, my body told me to stop. I spent 20 minutes refueling here again, but I eventually got moving.

**Vallorcine to Chamonix - 83km to 100km**

Food to the rescue again. I got up and started moving toward the last big climb of the race. It's the most technical climb - lots of rocks and very steep. Nevertheless, I passed more people up the climb to Tête au Vents. My legs were absolutely destroyed on the descent down into Chamonix though. My lack of real hill training made it impossible to more than shuffle down the last kilometers from La Flègere into Chamonix. I lost all of the places I gained on the climb up.

The last kilometer in was fun because crowds were already out waiting for the first finishers of the UTMB.

## Post-race

Well, it didn't go as planned but I was more interested in finishing than anything anyway. I also don't have any blisters, black toenails, or new injuries, I just have a regular case of DOMS.

It's true what they say: Ultramarathons are eating competitions with some running thrown in.

I was told it'd be a day off training after the shot but it has turned out to be not quite as peachy and (including the second dose next week, which I've been told will be even worse than the first) I'm looking at 4 of the 6 weeks of peak volume for this year gone down the drain.

What's the recommended way forward when the training plan has been significantly disrupted (Not just a single day when you are unable to train)? Do I continue from where I was pre-vaccine, peak later, then make the off-season shorter and postpone it another year? Ignore the missed weeks and try anyways?

Quickly, my current state is that I ran a few 50k runs in 2019 but nothing further and nothing like that far since. I've done a few 40k runs this year in training but most are 10k. I've probably done no more than 20k a week total training for months (but cycle and gym a lot so not unfit in general)

The 50k is dead flat, easy off road - so.....do I spend the next 2 weeks trying to get some miles in or/and drop a few pounds? I'm around 220lbs so could get down 6 or 7 but can't focus on weight dropping if also doing higher miles.

Lastly, a ""slow"" jog for me is 5m30 km/per hr pace - going slower (when fresh) feels odd - so do I run the 100km by doing my  natural pace and adding in lots of walks to drop the overall average to make it sustainable - or run real slow?

My target is anywhere from 12-14 hrs at a wild guess? My 5k is 19m, my 10k is 42m, full marathon is about 3hr 40 (off road) so I slow over distance (due to weight I expect) my last FLAT 50k was 5hr20 in 2019.",1629962647
ultrarunning,CodonUAG,2021 Tahoe 200 cancelled due to forest fires.,"Received the official notice via email. 

Dear Runners,

We had a long discussion with the USFS today. We have been waiting to hear from them after talks last week in regards to the Caldor Fire and forest closures. They have had several meetings about our event and about closures of National Forests around Lake Tahoe. We are so terribly sorry to say that we have been informed today that the race will not be allowed this year. There is no easy way to say this nor is there any way to lighten the blow. You have trained all year, this is your dream. We realize that you have put a lot into this event. It is a nightmare to have prepared so much and be left with so little. From the bottom of our hearts, we are sorry we could not do any more to make this happen. It is difficult as a racer and as organizers to be at the mercy of nature. This is our passion and we wish we could share it with you this year. 

It's heart wrenching to deliver this terrible news, but we hope that it gives some kind of closure and the opportunity to cancel travel plans or make new ones. After last year's cancellation due to COVID and now this year, we realize that this is two years now that many of you have waited to run this race and two years we have worked hard on our end to make it happen. This race requires a year of work from our entire team. This makes the blow even harder. 

Although we are all devastated to be missing the race this year, our hearts go out to the communities hit by the fire, to the many people who have lost their homes and livelihoods. To the courageous wildland firefighters and forest service risking their lives. As much as we hurt from the cancellation of the race, it can't compare to the losses being suffered by forest fires. Although we regret that the event will not be allowed, we understand that it is important to support the communities as they fight this fire. 

Part of our discussion with the USFS was how to mitigate this fire/smoke issue in future years? Even though last year was cancelled due to COVID, just two weeks later those same forests shut down due to fires as well. That makes two years in a row now that the forests in Tahoe have been closed for fires in September. With the support of the USFS we are planning to move the event permanently to June or early July. Those months are beautiful and green in the Tahoe Basin. Even though June can have lingering snow up high, it's usually mostly clear that time of year and snow does not close entire forests like fires do. Snow can more easily be rerouted around or run through and won't fill the air with dangerous particles. We will keep you informed on new dates and changes as we move forward.

Since hearing about the fire and discussing it with the USFS last week, we have been working on possible reroutes all weekend and week in order to hold the event in the case that it was allowed by local agencies and the smoke was to abate. Unfortunately, no reroutes will be allowed. We want to extend a big thank you to Phil Lowry for working with us on GIS and routes. We had a brilliant plan laid out that took many days and long conversations to develop. We wanted to be completely ready to put it into action if we got the OK from the USFS. 

We wanted to let you know as soon as possible. We will take some time to convene as a team and send you follow up details. We will be mailing out runner swag and merchandise in the next few weeks and we will want to make sure we have an accurate mailing address for you. Please stay tuned for further emails to confirm these items. You can check what address you have on file with Ultrasignup by logging into your ultrasignup account.  

Virtual Option for Racers to Earn their Finish on their Own
We realize it can in no way compare to the read deal Tahoe 200, however, we will be putting together details shortly so that you will still be able to run 200 miles, if you like, and still get your finish. Those who ""finish"" will be mailed their finisher awards. In typical virtual race style, you will pick your route, run it, upload your time and be mailed finisher awards. This will also allow athletes in the Triple Crown to complete the Triple despite the Tahoe 200 cancellation. Submissions will be reviewed and there will be some rules in regards to cut off time and route. We will keep in mind that cut off may need to be more generous as some of you may be running self supported or hillier/more technical routes. We will aim to get this all set up by next week.

Lastly, we want you to know that this decision did not come lightly to the USFS and every possibility we could imagine was explored over the past 6 days. We hope to hold the race in future years pre-fire season so moving to June will be a very positive change. We held the event for 6 years before COVID cancellation with no cancellations. We worry that with what seems like more and more fires in the area in late summer and fall that the September dates seem increasingly risky. We also believe that June or early July will showcase the incredible beauty and wildflowers of Lake Tahoe so that runners can really appreciate the area. 

Thank you for your patience over the past week and now as we work to sort out this emergency cancellation. Thank you for your understanding and kindness.",1629951389

ultrarunning,schvenbott,How to link training blocks - 50 miler to 100 miler,"I’ll be running my first 50 miler at the end of October, and want to figure out how best to setup my training with a 100 miler next summer in mind. 

A little background:
I’ve been running consistently since the beginning of 2018, and had a few years of lots of hiking before that. I ran my first road marathon in early in 2019, and a 50k that summer. That was a solid year of training that had good results. 2020 was hit and miss while figuring out shin splint issues and generally running very sporadically. I’ve been consistently running all of 2021 and am currently doing 45-60 MPW training for the 50 miler. 

My ultimate goal has always been to race a 100 miler. My goal is just to finish; I’m not speedy or looking to compete. My idea is to run a 100k around February - April next year, and then the 100 miler mid to late summer (haven’t targeted specific races yet). 

Does it make sense to recover from my October 50 miler, and go straight into another training block for the 100k? And then I can take a concentrated 6 months to prepare for the 100 miler? I’m running more than I ever have now, and just don’t want to overload myself. But I feel with a whole year basically to train I can be in a good position to tackle 100 miles.",1629832979
ultrarunning,ContentUnicorn,Target Heart Rate For First Ultramarathon?,"I'm doing my first 50K in October. It'll be a fairly flat looped trail course. For my training, I've been doing 80/20 endurance style workouts, so LOTS of zone 2 work (\~150 bpm). 

My goal is to finish sub-5 hours (or a 9:39/mi pace).

When I'm fresh, my zone 2 heart rate is around 9:30 a mile, however, my HR increases over time as I get into runs of 10+ miles. I could see my pace bleeding out into \~10:15/mi during the ultra.

ultrarunning,Run2far,Pre race calories,"I've been reading a lot of posts lately and also have a few friends that before their ultras they have a little bit of oatmeal, maybe with some pb or a banana,  and maybe a piece of toast with coffee on the side.  After seeing these tiny meals, I shake my head in confusion why they eat so little, then talk about how they fade from lack of energy.  I understand everyone is different and this might work for some people, but ever since I bonked at a marathon in my first year of running due to lack of calories, I always make sure I pack as many in as possible before a race.  If time allows I try to eat 2-3 hrs before each race.  I eat chocolate candy bars, pb, hamburgers, breakfast burritos...pretty much whatever my stomach can handle.  I try to get at least 1000 calories in before an ultra, and I stay on top of my calories during.  I have rarely had a problem since I started this.

ultrarunning,caverunner17,Race Report: Leadville 100,"Race: Leadville 100, August 21-22

Goal: Sub 25 hours

Results: DNF at mile 87.5

Leading up to the race, I had a pretty solid summer. Averaging 70-80 miles/week with double weekend long runs, cumulating with a 30+20 double 4 weeks ago, with the last mile of the 20 in 5:57. I was also averaging 6-8k feet of climbing/week. 

I spent the summer trying out new shoes, clothes, packs, and nutrition, before settling on what I though was a race plan. 

Race day: Didn't sleep much at all (if at all) the night before. Woke up at 2:45, had my usual coffee and a tiny bit of oatmeal with peanut butter and got dropped off at the start line. Race went off. Legs felt a little jello-y from the start, but nothing I didn't think a few mile warmup would solve. 

6 miles in, my race plan fell apart. My nutrition was going to be Tailwind, stroopwafels, clif bars, and a gel during the run legs (depending what I was feeling at the time), and then pretzels and PB&amp;J at aid stations, along with a can of V8 before and after Hope Pass. All of these are things I had practiced eating on my long runs without issues this summer. An hour in, I had my first Stroopwafel, and my stomach started cramping up and feeling like I was going to puke. I got to the May Queen aid station, pulled out a Clif bar.... and the same thing. 

It turned out, my stomach couldn't handle solid foods at all. Improvising, I concentrated on just using Tailwind and the on-course Liquidy Gu gels. 

I got into Outward Bound (23.5) feeling mostly energetic, having run the first portion with a group that was aiming for the 23 hour mark, right around what I wanted. I wasn't overly concerned about nutrition at that point as I had thought I had adapted. 

I made my way into Twin Lakes outbound in 6:59 making some friends along they way -- My jello-y legs weren't feeling any better, or worse, but I could tell that I was getting hungry. My crew pulls out one of the soft pretzels I packed, I had 2 bites, and could barely swallow it. 

Off to Hope Pass I go. I'm not a great climber, but I could immediately feel the lack of energy (though to be fair, it's 40 miles into the race). I make my way up and over and down into Winfield. New this year (COVID), there is no crew or pacers in Winfield. I end up sitting in the station for around 15 minutes trying to refill by bag and drink from the drop bag I sent over. I was convinced to try the Ramen, which seemed to go down OK (ish). 

On the way back up Hope Pass, it started raining and hailing for 10 minutes. As I made my way over, I really regretted not bringing a headlamp. It was getting dark as Hope took way longer than planned. Made it back to Twin Lakes at 8PM, picked up my pacer, then was on the struggle bus. As it turned out, my improvised plan of Twilwind and Gu wasn't working anymore. I was getting sick of all the sugar. Stopping at the Half Pipe aid station, I tried to down a pretzel stick, but immediately started dry heaving. I was really starting to feel the effects of my caloric deficit. Made my way into the Pipeline crew point (72ish miles) feeling really drained and doing the walk-run shuffle. Someone had an idea to try Chocolate Milk -- which worked! My next 4ish miles back into Outward bound felt pretty solid and I was able to run about half of it. Picked up my next pacer and had a solid climb up the first part of Powerline --- then my second wind fell off a cliff. I had been trying to force myself to still take in the Gu's every hour.... but at that point, even they were making me sick and I almost vomited taking in my 3rd one that leg. Making my way down Powerline, I was running numbers -- Assuming I'd get into the last Aid Station at 5:30, that would leave me 4.5 hours to get in the remaining 12.5 miles -- and knowing that most of my later aid station stops were about 8-10 minutes as I tried to scarf down some Ramen, that would make it only 4:20, or roughly 21:00 miles. 

The issue became apparent though that I couldn't maintain that. As we hit the smooth flats and downhills coming off the Powerline climb, I was struggling to maintain 20:00 pace -- then we hit single track, and my pace dropped to 25-27:00 for the last 2 miles. That brought me into the aid station at 5:45ish - meaning that I would only have roughly 4:05 to run 12.5, or needing to maintain roughly 19:00 pace. While that didn't seem horrible, the issue is that there are 6ish miles worth of single track around the lake, which at the same rate of running the last few single track miles, I was going to miss the cutoff by 30-40 minutes. Compounded, I was unable to stomach any additional calories. 

At that point, I was mentally over. Given I had been struggling for almost 10 hours with an ever increasing caloric deficit since the start, couldn't consume any additional food without getting sick and realizing that I would have to have a significant ""3rd wind"" out of nowhere to even make the cut-off time based on the paces I was running the prior miles, I concluded that I was done. 

I cried. 7 months of training thrown out over something that I had zero control over. My last pacer tried to make me go, however I had a simple answer: At no point in the prior 20 miles had I averaged 19:00 pace or faster for more than 2-3 miles straight. To run that pace for 12.5 miles, half of which on somewhat technical single track and have a climb back into Leadville all while not being able to consume any additional calories wasn't going to happen. 

I won't lie - I think this will be my only 100. While I enjoyed many aspects of the race, the long training hours and lost weekends got between myself and my Fiancee, and frankly, to spend all the time, money and hours planning for it, only for something so simple to go wrong really put a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). 

That said, I'm excited to check out some trail 50k's!",1629669706
ultrarunning,landboisteve,Running my first ultra - clueless about socks and shoes,"This November I will run my first ultra - it's an 8-hour event where the 'winner' is the person that runs the most loops, and each loop is 6 miles. 

Right now I've only run on roads and the treadmill, and run exclusively in Asics GT-1000/2000s. Starting in September I'll try to get a weekly run in on trails.

While I haven't seen the course, it's ""mostly groomed trails or dirt road"". Would I be able to use my normal running shoes for that? I don't have a ton of time to experiment, but I do know Asics has a (GT-2000 Trail Version)[https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gt-2000-9-trail/p/ANA_1011B046-001.html?width=Standard], which is the GT-2000 with a different traction pattern. I'd be okay with spending $120 if it make the run pleasant.

I'm also curious about socks -  right now I use Puma short socks from Costco which are 100% cotton, I haven't had any issues until now even when hiking/running 4 hours. Should I try another sock that could be better for longer races?

ultrarunning,Epell8,What happened to my quads and why?,"I just had the most terrible experience at a race and I’m flabbergasted trying to understand what happened. I don’t even know what to type into Google or what doctor to ask so I’ll throw it out here to see what your opinions are.

I’m pretty fit right now and have had excellent training, so that is not the issue here. I am happy and healthy in regard to this race so it isn’t a mental issue. I was also hydrated and well fed starting the race, so that wasn’t it either.

I began the race (my first 100k) feeling good and moving. Right after I heard my watch click signaling the first mile, we went through a few nettles and I felt one get between the tongue of my shoe and the front of my ankle. Rather than ignore it and let it develop into an issue, I stepped to the side of the trail, bent over and removed it real quick. 

As soon as I stood up, my quads seized and cramped like nothing I’d ever experienced before. They swelled, started shaking and I could not walk, let alone run. My friend saw me and tried to help me keep going. He gave me salt to see if it was an electrolyte issue (it didn’t help) and then we tried pain reliever. Then he helped me aggressively massage my calves and pound them to get them to loosen. Nothing helped. I couldn’t sit down without doing a log roll on the ground. I hobbled to the aid station at mile 6 and was pulled off the course. My legs stopped seizing a couple hours later and I was able to move around better.

Today, I feel like I either did a massive leg day gym session or had a long downhill workout. My body and mind still feel fresh, but my quads are still sore. I’m getting the sense that the soreness will resolve in a few days with foam rolling and massage.

Any ideas as to what could have happened? I am still fit so most likely will do a race in a few weeks to get the most of this training cycle. But of all the things I thought would go wrong in this effort, quad cramps at mile 1 was not it.",1629650043

ultrarunning,djc0,Anyone else here running/training while dealing with ongoing chemo? How have you adjusted?,"I know this might be a bit of an unusual post. But I’ve been on chemo/immuno drugs for the past ~2 years now, along with a stem cell (aka bone marrow) transplant last year. But throughout working hard to keep my running up when I can. 

It’s hard to find people going through similar experiences and how they adjust and cope. Recovering from the more serious treatment aside (the SCT was about 6 months), the side effects from some of the drugs/drug combinations have played havoc with my max HR, overall HR, oxygen transport/breathing, recovery/sleep … not to mention overheating (even when the weather is cold). Training has had to change (along with my expectations). 

For me I’m managing lenalidomide, daratumuamb, and dexamethasone on a daily/weekly basis. Before all this I was running 3000-4000km per year and have done 15 marathons. Losing all that base was hard but I’m so far back up to over 1000km for the year so far. My easy pace before was around 5:45/km with average HR 140’ish bpm, now ~8:00/km at ~155bpm. Max HR changes depending on drugs and dosage, but can change from ~180bpm to 165bpm over the course of a month. It’s weird.

I do all my  morning runs fasted without any breakfast and don't fuel on my long run, currently around 2h.At the end of most runs i can feel that my glycogen stores are pretty empty. During the week it is more about time efficiency, it just takes way less time to have the breakfast after my run. For the long run i just have my regular breakfast and then take no nutrition with me. Over time my body has adapted pretty well to the midweek fasted runs and my long run just gets a bit unpleasant towards the end, so i guess i'm still far away from bonking, but i still feel the lack of nutrition.

My rationale would be to improve fat burning and to get a feel for nutritional deficits, to be more sensitive. There is also some research done on this topic, it supposedly enhances the release of interleukin 6 and improves fat burning.

I would most likely limit this to workouts up to 2h and for everything above i would fuel during the run.",1629560008

Long story short, I finished my first Ultra (a very technical 80km with 3600m d+) a week ago. It was also my first running race/event since I've been only running for a year and a half (im 25)... and my first time really running in trails. I finished in 17:10 since I know I spent way to much time at the 5 aid stations (between 15 minutes and 1h10).  I was the second to last male and within 50 minutes of the cutoff, therefore I'm wondering if I really ""deserve"" to say to myself that I ran an ultra since people can't probably walk faster than my pace.

Would love some outside thoughts. I'm working with a coach and running 40-50mpw with about half on trail. Everything was going great until pretty recently; I've struggled a little on some of my recent long runs, particularly yesterday, and on many runs my total time would be seriously pushing the cutoff time for my 50miler. 

On one hand, I've worked really hard for nearly a year with this 50 in mind. I'd be pretty disappointed to not try.  I don't want to waste my current fitness since I'm not sure what my long term plans are in running. I can stay on the course after the cutoff and still technically finish, even if I officially DNF. My coach says I'm ""fit enough to go for it"". On the other hand, I don't want to  spend the entire race day stressing about the cutoff which might take a fair amount of enjoyment out of the experience. I also really struggled yesterday on a peak long run and I do not want to feel that shitty during the race. Granted, that run came on the heels of an unusual week. 

I ran my first trail races this year. In February I ran a  marathon with 5500' of vert. I finished with a total time of 5:19:15. In May I ran my first ultra, a 50k with 7500' of vert and I finished with a total time of 7:13:57. In July I ran my 2nd 50k also with about 7k vert,  but a much more challenging course (technically and at elevation) and I finished with a total time of 8:02:02. 

Anyway, yesterday was  discouraging, but I have been working really hard. I would be disappointed to step down from 50 miles, but also proud to complete three 50k's in my first yet of ultra running so I'm struggling to make  the decision and I'm just looking for outside thoughts.

ultrarunning,Djootn_,First 100 Mile race,"Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend was my first ever 100mile race. What an experience it was!

I've only been running since June 2019 and ran my first marathon in June 2020.

When I started running I was quite overweight (30kg or 66 pounds) so I needed to shed the weight before running long distances and ramping up the milage.

&amp;#x200B;

The aim for the race was quite ambitious, me and a friend of mine headed out with the aim to run under 24hours. My friend had quite a bit more experience then me with long events (ran 100k and a couple of 50milers before) and my longest distance was 57k and longest time on feet was 8hours.

First hours where amazing, the weather was nice, we were right on pace even a bit faster then we expected and everything felt amazing. The only thing that was bothering me was my stomach didn't feel right but nothing serious. A bit later in the day temperatures increased quite a bit (26° Celsius or 78° Fahrenheit) and I felt it. I became quite hard to keep myself hydrated even with checkpoints every 20k and salt tablets. I sweat quite a lot when I run and the temperature in Belgium hasn't been this high in quite a few weeks.

Still I was feeling great up until 115km. It became dark and we went on the more technical part of the trail. I became very sleepy, couldn't focus anymore and some part I probably closed my eyes because 30meters or so went by without me remembering. My friend was struggling the first few hours but he improved the further the race went en kept me going. 

Then at about 138km there was a technical descent where I lost my friend and had to walk 7km to the next checkpoint where my friend waited for me. From those 7km I don't really remember anything, I was close to sleepwalking probably and It took forever because the terrain was quite technical and my body was really rebelling, stomach issues, legs where shot, feet really hurt etc but I managed to get there. 

Upon arriving at the checkpoint my friend waited for me a bit worried because he didn't expect me to be that far behind. I told him he should carry on without me because the only thing I could manage the last 16k was walking at a slow pace and I probably needed a powernap before I even wanted to set off. He did and really went for it managing to finish the last 16k in less then 2 hours and even ran his fasted km's of the race. I on the other hand slept for 20minutes before setting of and had to walk for a solid 4hours before finishing almost giving in to quit at 158km.

I finished in 28hours and 52 minutes and I am quite proud of it because I have the feeling that it was all I had in me that day! 

It was the hardest, most painful and probably the most fun experience in my life and can't wait to my next race! 

Hope you guys enjoyed this quick summary of my race(it's my first long post on reddit and English is not my native tongue!) If you have any questions feel free to ask! :)

Ps: If anyone has any tips on how to stay alert during nighttime in and ultra please let my know. Almost falling asleep was the thing that slowed me down the most :)",1629234104

I try to compete in at least 2 trail races a year as motivation to continue my training year-round.  I prefer the ""mountain ultra"" style of trail race with extreme mountain ascents and descents.  These races seem to have a good mix of trail running, hiking, and beautiful mountain scenery that I enjoy.  Up to this point, I haven't had to worry too much about cutoff times.

I'd like to upgrade to my first 50 miler this year but I am struggling to find one that has easy enough cutoff times that I wouldn't have to stress about it.  For reference, my time in the Beaverhead 55k was 11:30 (34 miles, 6000 ft ascent, 9000 ft descent).  I live in Wyoming so preferably somewhere within a 6-8 hour drive.  Mountain ultra preferred.

I run with a Salomon Adv Skin 5L - two 500ml flasks and a 2L bladder. I clean and dry on a regular basis, and deep clean/sanitize on an as-needed basis. I've disassembled the bite valves to blast out built up debris. And this has served me well for the last several years...

But my kit is approaching 4 years. The bladder and soft flasks are in excellent conditions, but the valves are not holding seal. The pocket flasks take in air and start to get that 'swish' sound when I run. Worse yet, the bladder actively leaks from the valve at the end of the tube. My shirt gets soaked all the way down to the shorts. This level of water saturation opens the possibility of chafing... especially on my long, long runs.

I’m looking at the Riverlands 100 in Maine (May) and Umstead in NC (April). Riverlands is within 3 hours drive from my house and the old school feel is appealing to me, but would present technical hilly terrain and possible weather issues. Umstead would be a long drive or a flight, but logistics seem easy and the looped course with smooth path might be a better introduction to the distance. Any thoughts from those with experience for either of these races? I guess another point is I’d be training through a Vermont winter, so much of my training miles for either race would be hilly pavement/dirt road depending on trail conditions in spring.

ultrarunning,jmrdelorean,Running pack durability,"How long do a lot of your running packs/ vests last? I’ve had two different packs and they have lasted me two very different lengths of time. 

My Osprey Aura 6 has seen pretty hard us for 2.5 years between all my long runs and races. It’s held up really well. Some of the materials in the shoulder straps are just starting to fail but otherwise it’s been a great, well designed pack. My Raidlight Lazerdry 25 is a different story. 

I’ve only ran with the Lazerdry this season and mostly on my long runs. It’s got some pretty bad design issues. The water bladder sleeve is in the main compartment and started to tear when I put my sleeve in it the first time. It’s difficult to get it in and out to refill. Stuff tends to fall out of the side pockets. The side pockets are also starting to tear. The bottom zipper is starting to fail.

ultrarunning,_nerdy_by_nature_,Zone 2 training for first 50K—am I doing it all wrong??,"
About me: 44F with 25 year history of recreational, middle-of-the-pack road running. 7 marathons (NYC, Chicago x 2, Boston x 3). 
PR’s:
Marathon 4:12 @ Boston
Half 1:55
10K 52:30
5K 23:18

Other possibly pertinent info: 5’6” 130 lb, training with Garmin instinct and Garmin HRM-pro chest strap

Recent backpacking trips evolved into fastpacking trips and ultimately to the realization that I love trail running way more than road running. Fast forward to present day, and my first 50K is 9 weeks away. http://pm2hrultras.com/details/  
My primary goal is to avoid a DNF. My secondary goal is to avoid a DFL finish, and my bonus goal is to finish in a respectable time.
For training, I started off with a modified marathon training program I’ve used before, but with more mileage. Meanwhile, I started reading everything I could find on the subject of ultrarunning/endurance and as a result, totally shifted my training approach from everything I’ve ever known and implemented—tempo runs, speed work, hill workouts and long runs—to 100% zone 2 training, as I soon discovered that I have aerobic deficiency syndrome as described in Training for the Uphill Athlete. And just like the book warns, this training has been frustrating and challenging, since I have been forced to run at what feels like a lethargically slow pace in order to keep my HR in zone 2. I’ve also been binging on the Science of Ultra podcast, and one statement Dr. Bearden made is “Easy runs are still runs; they’re not a shuffling jog.” Yet, in order to stay at or below my AeT, which according to Maffetone’s 180 formula is 136, that’s exactly what I am having to do: a shuffling jog. For example, last weekend, I ran 20 miles on a rail trail—a soft-packed, completely flat trail—and I had to shuffle-jog the whole thing in order to stay in zone 2. My first mile was a 10:44 pace and last mile was a crawling 14:51 pace! It was incredibly challenging to “run” that slowly, not to mention the effect on the ego, as less-fit folks were passing me left and right. My average pace for the whole 20 was 13:07 and average HR was 137. I was able to easily breathe out of my nose the entire 4 hours and 22 minutes. And when I go for trail runs, I am forced to run/walk, run/walk to stay in zone 2. I have so many questions about this approach, but the main three are as follows:
1. With my race being only 9 weeks away, how in the world will I be prepared for a 50K trail race with 3800ft elevation gain if all my training is at a snail’s pace on easy, flat surface? And how will I be prepared to run (or even power hike) the ups at a faster pace than which I am currently training?
2. Another take-home from my reading and research is that zone 2 training allows for a limitless supply of fuel via fat metabolization, and all my training thus far has supported this theory. In fact, I did that 20 mile run on water only and felt surprisingly fine both during and after the run. (I did have Tailwind Rebuild immediately after the run.) Running without taking in calories is a foreign concept to me. For reference, for all my marathon training in the past, I would take in fuel every 45 mins or so on long runs. So when exactly should I start practicing with fuel for a race-day strategy?
3. How will I become a stronger uphill athlete aka trail/ultrarunner if this method of training is keeping me from running any hills at all(due to the fact that my HR jumps past 136 as soon as I start running uphill, so I have been walking all hills)??

I feel like I’m missing something big-picture wise. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice to offer, I would be most appreciative!",1627862125
ultrarunning,rhymeswithvegan,Race Report: White River 50M,"This was my third time running 50 miles but my first time doing it in an organized event. Garmin stats: 49.1 miles (79 km), 9786 feet (2983 m) of gain.    
    

The White River 50 at Crystal Mountain in Washington has boasted big names like Anton Krupicka, Michael Wardian, Scott Jurek, and Sage Canaday. Runners toe the unassuming start line in the shadow of the great Mount Tahoma, the tallest volcano in the Cascade mountain range. I left my house on the island just after two, arriving at the race start as darkness still shrouded the forest in mystery. My hands trembled as I taped my toes and slid them into my socks. I breathed deeply and tried to calm myself, but it was in vain. I knocked back a cup of fireball whiskey and jogged to the start line.     
    

And we were off. The four miles to the first aid station were flat and smooth. The aptly named White River rushed beside us. Runners were silent as we began the first 3000 foot climb up to Little Ranger Peak. I sucked down gels and realized I was low on fluids for this nearly-nine-mile section. Fuck. We topped the 5,000 foot peak and ran along the ridge. I settled behind three friends running together. The woman in front of me was stung by a bee and didn’t even break stride. Bad Ass. The trail was lined with wildflowers as tall as me. The contrast of their green vibrancy against towering trees scarred by fire filled me with wonder and awe. A quick stop at the aid station and then I was alone again. I floated down the descent and into the Buck Creek aid station. The volunteers already had my drop bag in hand as I sauntered in. Now it was time to climb again. I partnered up with a guy running his first ultra, shirtless with a pack. I winced at the thought of the “chaffage” in this humidity. It was muggy and the breathtaking views of the mountain were marred by clouds. And so began the second 3000 foot climb. I chatted with the runner behind me, A. His inexperience showed and my concern for him was a distraction from my own struggles. Mostly, we suffered in silence. The camaraderie was comforting. It was hot and none of the aid stations had ice. In that moment, I would have traded my first born for a glass of ice water. Halfway up the climb, the aid station was a welcome sight. They had ice. They took my pack and filled it with ice water. I told the volunteer I loved him and asked him to marry me. He smiled and said “we’re runners too”. I couldn’t wait for A. When I stopped moving, I was filled with dread from the fervent fatigue, the exhaustion consumed me. I had to keep moving or else I would collapse in a chair and surrender. He caught me soon and I offered words of encouragement. “We’re almost there!”. I knew when I reached the summit of Sun Top at mile 37, I could finish. I felt the relief well up as I saw the cars parked before I saw the aid station tent. I took a deep breath and swallowed the tears. “I’m so happy to see you!” I exclaimed to the volunteers. My drop bag had whiskey and I needed it. I dropped my poles, shared shots with A, and sailed down the buttery smooth descent with elation. I had it in the bag, I thought. I powered through my low during the climb, and it was supposed to be easy from here. It was not. The high quickly faded and I had three more shots of fireball and a rice crispy treat at mile 43. A was ready to be done, so he took off ahead of me and I tried to keep up. But a pounding, all-consuming migraine slowed me to not much more than a stumble. The forest was getting dark as the sun began to sink behind the mountains. The river danced beside me, the breeze cooling the tears on my face. I was stewing in my misery, feeling sorry for myself. My chronic headaches feel like a disability and I was both angry and sad. I sobbed. I couldn’t run even though my body was strong. I felt so betrayed by this vessel of my consciousness. 5 people passed me. Maybe more. I fantasized about coming upon a bear and letting it eat me. For a brief moment, I had enough cell signal to call my husband. He reassured me and told me was proud. He is deployed and I missed him terribly. I missed the comforting hand of my sweet 5 year old daughter, the way she strokes my cheek and tells me everything is okay. How can a small child be so graceful?      
    


When I finally reached the bridge that was just around a bend to the finish line, I sighed with relief. I didn’t realize how fucked up my face looked from all the crying until I saw myself in the mirror later. I crossed the finish line and went straight to my car and sobbed. I was proud and happy to be done but I just needed to get out the tears, ride that wave of emotion. I was mad at myself for being weak. For letting the pain get to me. After living with it for my entire existence, you would think I would be used to it by now. I have headaches 24/7 and have for my entire life. Nothing has helped and a dozen specialists and treatments have been unsuccessful. Ultrarunning is helping me restructure the way I feel about pain and has empowered me. But when the barriers broke down at mile 45, I couldn’t fight it. I let the monster consume me. One day I hope to be stronger so I can look him in the eye and say “I don’t care about you anymore”.    
    


I finished in 13 hours and made the long drive back home. No chafing, no injury, just one small blister on my toe. The next morning, I emptied my drop bags and found A's shirt in the one from Sun Top, where we shared shots of whiskey. I have no recollection of putting it there and frankly have no idea how it got there. I do remember him removing it from his pack and complaining about how heavy it was since it was soaked in sweat. I must have offered to stow it for him. Ultra “brain fog” is definitely a thing.

ultrarunning,moose_truce,Top of Foot Pain for Last 6 Months,"Not looking for medical advice necessarily just want to know if anyone has had any success beating an issue like this. 

In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",1627849232

I was told the following analogy about runners (specifically for the Boston Marathon, but I think it could apply to any race). I am skeptical of the story but I'd like to do my due diligence. I'm using my best Google-fu but still coming up short. I'm looking for stories similar to the analogy described below and any sources or communities you can point me to that might know more.

Here's the analogy:

&gt;You have trained for years to even qualify to run... you have come to Boston... you have started running the race..... and then you realize how hard running a marathon really is. So, at mile 16, you quit. You realize that quitting is so much easier than running and you start to rationalize that quitting was the smart thing to do. But there is a problem, your brother also prepared, came to Boston, and ran the race, and he did not quit. At first, you are ok with him running and finishing the race but quickly the guilt of being a quitter starts to eat away at you. You start to badmouth running and your brother in hopes of alleviating the guilt and now anger you feel towards running.  
Quickly you realize that your old group of friends, who are runners, are not going to buy into your badmouthing of running; so, you gravitate towards other ex-runners who also hate it. Soon you are in an echo chamber... you are all reassuring each other that you are right, you keep saying that running is evil, you all talk about how much easier it is to not go running, and only fools would run a marathon. But every time you see a runner it pricks your conscience and triggers guilt from \[not exercising\], shame from your lifestyle, and anger that they dare find joy in running.  
Soon it becomes your quest not just to not run, but to get other runners to quit running too. You start to blog, tweet, and Facebook about how awful running is, it becomes all-consuming. ...You feed off the running hate-fest of others. For each runner that you can convince to quit will provide you the momentary satisfaction that you are at least not alone in your misery. The longer this cycle continues the less you remember the joy of running with your brother and friends, till the only memories are jaded memories of everyone being rude, and how awful running felt.

I'm trying to find these poor former-runners who are consumed by hatred stemming from their own inadequacy to get their side of the story but despite how vocal they are described to be in this analogy, I'm having some trouble.

I assume as runners yourselves, you are constantly assaulted by these kinds of people who have quit and seem to relentlessly attack your choice to run. Please share your stories.",1627754839

* Oct 3rd 50K (already signed up for this one)
* Oct 9th/10th 25K/50K (same course/organizer)

I almost stupidly/boldly signed up for the 50/50 double on Oct 2nd/3rd. The following weekend popped up in my email just in time to give me second thoughts!

For some context I've done two 50K's this year, plus three other marathon+ length trail runs (two FKTs and a last-one-standing).

I should probably be reasonable and skip the Oct 2 event entirely. But if I was to do 50's on the 3rd and 9th... anyone have pertinent experience or advice? Anyone want to smack some sanity back into me? Bring me a beer at the finish line (or halfway point)?

None of the PT's are insightful. I'm not searching for medical advice. Just some support and experience.","I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Is there a reason why Camelbak hydration vests aren't that popular, am I missing something? How good are Salomon bladders when used with Adv Skin 5? Do they leak at all?

Bonus question for women: has anyone bought either Camelbak Circuit 1.5 Women's, or Salomon Adv Skin 8 (the one designed specifically for women's build) vests? Would they be worth investing? I'm usually a bit wary of any unisex gear or clothes because of different fits!",1627492284

Just looking to see what experience others have had with Morton's neuroma and surgery/mitigation.

I am 7 weeks out from surgery now and can walk in normal shoes, but I am still feeling some swelling and nerve jolts in the ball of my foot (especially barefoot) and running seems like a bad idea just yet.

I'm looking into getting my first vest for trail running and think I've settled for the Salomon Adv Skin 5. But I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to fit. I'm quite a tall lanky guy at 2,05m/6ft 8"" and 90kg/198lbs. My chest measures 101 cm/39.7""  I've got both the M and L to try at home and kinda feel that I'm inbetween sizes. I usually don't do any longer runs in winter so the most layers that I'll have underneath is probably a t-shirt + windjacket. 

Loaded with some clothes in the back and socks in the front the vests fit like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/YfkyniN) Unfortunately I can't fill the bottles if I want to return them. Both fits quite snug but the large it's a tad roomier which makes me worry that it'll bounce around to much. The medium probably won't bounce, but it might be a little tight around the armpits. Will the vest permanently stretch out after a lot of use or will the fit basically stay the same? 

I'd be grateful for any insight on which to choose!

I did not twist my knee or anything when playing and I could have even played longer. Felt fine after basketball until 2.5-3 hours after the session. I felt my knee stiffen up at the back of the knee and in front of the knee. 1-2 hours later when I go to bed the stiffness starts to turn into immense pain, like 10/10 pain and for 3 hours during the night I was literally not able to move my leg because of how much pain I was in. I took an anti inflammatory went to sleep and woke up 3-4 hours later. That immense pain was gone but my entire knee was tender and lost full extension and flexion of the knee joint. when I woke up in the morning, I was able to walk on it fine and put my entire weight on it fine but with that tenderness  and loss of full extension/flexion. The following day, I regained full flexion and extension and the knee was still tender. 6 days after I go to the gym to test it out, and I am able to do single leg squats, lunges with weights lateral jumps and so forth with no problem. The only difference I noticed is that the knee felt weaker than my right knee. 2 weeks after the ""incident"" today, my knee is almost 100% back to normal with just a bit of tednerness to the touch and still does not feel 100% strong like my other knee.

ultrarunning,Jaha13,"Question: heart rate won't stay below zone 3 at high mileage, but perceived effort is zone 2-ish","Greetings!  I am hoping y'all can offer some insight.  I am training for my first official 50k, and I've done a few marathons/shorter distance in the past.  This is my first time doing structured training and I am doing the 80/20 system, focusing on keeping 80% of my runs in zone 2 based on heart rate.  My race-day goal is to finish in under 6 hours.

Since I began preparing for this race, I've been focusing on total weekly mileage and before this weekend had not run further than about 13 miles in a single training run.

I just ran my first longer run (21 miles) since I began this training regimen.  Up to about mile 12, I kept my heart rate easily in zone 2.  It crept up to zone 3 periodically and I slowed down to bring it down.  

I did a pit stop at mile 11 to use the bathroom and ate half a PB&amp;J.

After about mile 12, my heart rate went up into zone 3 or higher and stayed there.  My perceived effort still felt zone 2-ish though.  By mile 15, I was feeling not as fresh as when I first started but energy levels were good.  But by mile 15 I could not bring my heart rate below zone 3, even when I walked at a completely casual pace.  When I jogged it went up to zone 4.  It remained that way the last 5 miles of the run.  

From an energy level/perceived effort perspective, my run was consistent with my goals.  But the higher heart rate concerned me based on the 80-20 training principals and my goal of maintaining that energy level for another 10 miles.  

I would appreciate any insight from those who have experience with this.  Is that normal?  At that point, should I focus on perceived effort instead of heart rate number?

I don't think my diet affected my heart rate, but I will mention that some of my nutrition I had on the run had caffeine in it.  It was total 100mg of caffeine, which was divided into 6 portions.  I took one portion (1/6th of 100mg) every 40 minutes over the 4 hour run.  I normally drink 200mg of caffeine per day (coffee) and I only had one cup of coffee so far that day, so I don't think the caffeine would have affected my heart rate.

ultrarunning,dr_comonad,New shoes causing foot pain?,"This is a bit of a noob question, but I'd love to get some advice.

I'm new to trail running and longer distances. Previously, I had one pair of road running shoes that I loved and wore out after about 800 miles running casually and a several half marathons + training. Then I stopped doing much running for about 5 years once we had kids. I am getting back into running and have been running trails doing runs between 5-25k hoping to get to 50k someday. I've been wearing a pair of a road shoes I bought last year to replace the olds and it's been fine but the trails here have been very muddy and wet and I wanted to 'graduate' to some trail running shoes (only discovered the distinction from watching Ginger Runner). I've been holding off because I don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy shoes, but saw a significant sale at the weekend in a local store and picked up a pair of Asics Sonoma 5 GT-X and Fuji Trabuco 8 both the same size. I thought I got a pretty good fit (tried them in person). My feet were feeling pretty sore after the weekend as I ran 25k on Saturday and the on Sunday I ended up having to walk for a very long time in terrible flat deck shoes. My feet were feeling pretty tired and sore on Monday. Tuesday I took the Sonomas out for short 5k spin. Whilst the extra grip felt amazing compared to running in road shoes (especially going downhill on trails) my right foot (on the top) got really painful and then felt horrible for the rest of the evening. My left foot starting to feel a little weirdly numb (kinda like start of pins and needles) whilst running. Now on Wednesday my right foot feels okay but kinda strained in the tendons on top in a way I've never felt before. I'm wondering if this could be the new shoes (combined with some stress from the weekend walking) and whether this might just be that they need time to 'warm up' / 'stretch out' / whatever to my feet? Is that a thing?

I don't really remember feeling this kind of thing before, but (to my embarrassment) I have only ever bought two pairs of running shoes (seen above). Could it be a sizing issue? If anything they feel a little bit looser than my current shoes, mostly at the heel. There is plenty of space up front (about a thumbs width between my big toe and end). Should I just give them time to wear in or should I try to exchange them (I'm guessing this is not possible since I already wore them... damn)? I'm pretty terrified of getting injured (I had a meniscus issue a few months back that knocked me back and it sucked) but the money thing is an issue.

Any advice appreciated, I'm kinda new to this. I guess till my foot feels better I will rest and just run in the shoes I was running in before which didn't cause any foot noticeable pain (not at 5k distance anyway!) I haven't taken the Fuji Trabuco's out for a spin, but I am hoping they will be different. But maybe I should cut my losses and return those as I haven't worn them out yet (I don't know how different they could be to the Sonomas, they look quite different structurally compared to the Sonomas and they feel a bit more of a snug fit when just wearing them around the house).",1626902130

I am a software engineer who started to run recently. While I was doing my research about running I found out that I should track heart zones during workouts.

I searched for heart zones watchOS tracking apps, tried some, but none of them seemed to suit me well. My requirements were mainly:

* Track heart zone with other workout metrics (distance, bpm, pace, time) in same screen without scrolling, just with glance at my watch.
* Device beeps (vibrations) when passing through zones.
* Support of continuous alert when leaving target zone. Stop beeping when entered target zone again.

As a bonus, few times I wanted to know when sunset occurs as I didn't know if I could take extended route and make it home until sunset. Like some sort of sun pictogram with minutes left, showing 45 mins before sunset.

So I decided to create a watchOS app for myself that will satisfy my needs, which I mentioned earlier. Currently I have working prototype, that I am beta testing by myself. I am planning to add new features, companion iOS app with settings etc.

I had a 30 miler on the schedule for my training run this weekend.  I live in the Southeastern US where we have the joy of both heat and humidity.  I started at 5:10am in the dark at 72F and 97% humidity.

I kept a slow and steady pace knowing that it was going to warm up quite a bit during the 30 miles.  All went well until about mile 23 when I started cramping in my legs.

I ran a 9.5 mile loop, at the end of each loop, stopped and either changed out bottles or refilled bottles at my car, and continued.  Each loop I carried three 500ml soft flasks and wiped them out each loop.

 

The fluids I took were:

Loop 1: 1L of electrolytes, 500ml of complex carbs (250 cals)  
Loop 2: 1L of complex carbs  (500 cals), 500ml of electrolytes  
Loop3  : 500ml of electrolytes and complex carbs (250 cals), 500ml of complex  carb (250 cals), and 500ml of electrolytes, and I took in 1 gel that was  190 cals with electrolytes around mile 24.x

Every hour I took 2 salt stick chews as well.

In total, including the water I drank at my vehicle, I took in 5L of fluids maybe a tick more.  Yet still cramped, and even more important than that - I lost 11 pounds of water weight during the run.  ELEVEN POUNDS.  


So my question is, for others that are in the hot/humid environments, what is your typical intake goal per hour for fluids.  My goal was 1L per hour, which I fell a little short of, next time I will have 2L of fluids on me for a 9-10 mile loop.  In addition to that, what is your caloric intake goal during an hour (yes, I know everyone is different).  


I have a 50 mile training run on 8/21, and it will still be hot/humid/muggy then, and I am trying to plan better, and stay hydrated better, because I felt miserable for the remainder of the day on Saturday.

In 1966, Jean Pierre Marquant, an ex-paratrooper from France became the first known person to deliberately attempt to cross Death Valley on foot during the heat of the summer. He accomplished a solo circular route of more than 100 miles that also involved scaling several high peaks.

In 1969, James Burnworth and Stanley Roderfer from San Diego, CA, started the idea of going from the low point (-282 feet) at Badwater, to the top of Mount Whitney (14,505 feet) when they successfully hiked it in two weeks during November.

I was running an easy long run (15 miler) and around mile 8 my left leg blew up. Specifically, dull pain started behind the left knee, then radiated up to the left butt cheek and all the way down to my left pinkie toe. I went from an 8min/mile pace to an 11+min pace. I finished the ‘run’ (more of a shuffle).

Clearly, I didn’t tear anything, as the pain would have been too much to keep running. Some friends think it’s sciatic nerve inflammation. I’ve been icing it, applying heaps of bengay, and using a Theragun Saturday and Sunday.

My question is: what kind of recovery timeline am I looking at? What should I do or NOT do so I can get back out there quickly? I’m also open to other people’s ideas of what the cause of the pain could be… (one thought is that I was running in new shoes that only had about 20 miles on them)

Last November we ran 60k last November at a 5:46 /km pace. We sort of winged it with the training schedule.

We continued with half marathons for two weeks and then we did the 60km.

However, 85km (let's round it up) is another 25km. Should we train like we did until 60km or leave it at 45 again? We're already running half marathons weekly for months again.

Some info about me and my route before I continue:

18 years old, been running for about 2 years now, I run about 30-40kms a week right now, but planning on increasing to about 50km a week over the course of the next few weeks

Planning on running a 50km in late september (probably closer to 48kms), by myself. No official race or anything just wanted to do it off my own back. The run itself is very flat, practically a road run for the most part, only about 300m of elevation over the course of the whole run. This will also be my first 'ultra'

I dont have a time goal or anything, the only metric im going to try and stick to is running around 7:00 minutes per km for most of the run. And if I have to walk some, so be it. I just want to finish it.

&amp;#x200B;

The main point of this post was to find some more information on race nutrition as the majority of things online are based on race environment high elevation change trail runs. Ive done a bunch of research on race nutrition but to not much success except for finidng some popular real foods to run with. I have previously ran a half marathon on only 2 gels, feeling pretty good at the end of it. 

Just wondering if someone more experienced than me can assist me in helping find out what to take on my run based off the info I have given. Could I do the run purely on gels and blocks or will I need real food?

Sorry about the wall of text, just couldnt really find much info about nutrition for my situation.

I have been running for about 3 years now. Nothing serious - 5ks, 10k, and half marathons. As a point of reference, my half-marathon PB is 1:54 - nothing spectacular. I'm 5'10"" and 188lbs (on the heavier side). I run about 25mpw, half of that is on the treadmill.

A buddy of mine roped me into running a trail 50-mile race July 2022. I was also thinking of running my first marathon Fall 2022, so I know I need to get to work. This gives me about a year to train for the 50-mile race.

Right now my goal is to lose get to 180lbs by the end of August, and PB the 5k, 10k, and half-marathon - I'm running one of each of those in September/October, all two weeks apart. My training plan peaks at 40mpw.

**Question**: And then what? I'd love to **crush** the 50-mile trail race next summer. But I live in MN where running outside sucks Nov-March. I will still run outside 1-2 times a week to keep my ""outdoor running muscles"" in shape. Unfortunately, the miles are so much easier to do on the treadmill. My idea is:

- Maintain 30-35mpw with at least 10 miles outdoors, even during the MN winter. 
- Spend a lot of time doing squats, deadlifts, core, and other supplementary strength training
- One day a week on an exercise bike to work non-running leg muscles
- Try to get my weight down to 165lbs by next March
- Do a 50-mile training plan from March 2022 - July 2022

I want to start training to run my first ultra before my 30th birthday next July, and I’m wondering if anyone has advice for a slow runner on how to get the longer training runs in. The furthest I’ve ran so far is 15 miles. My last truly long run (13.1 miles) was back in April, before I injured my ankle. I’ve been in PT ever since and have done a couple of 8 milers and a few 7 milers since then, but I want to start building back up to double digit long runs so I can feel more ready to really start ultra training this fall. 

The problem is it’s taking me 2+ hours to run 8 miles (with 1000+ feet of elevation gain). A lot of this is due to the heat (I live in Arizona which is basically a furnace in the summer). I’m spending roughly 12 hours running each week, and that’s only getting me 40-45 MPW.

I've been having a lot of problems with cramps on any run over 22 miles, mostly in the calfs but sometimes in my thighs and even in my back on occasion. 


I'm a heavy sweater and sweat a lot of salt. I get crusty arms and you can see it outlined in my caps, running vest and clothes. 


I ran an ultra this past weekend and managed to keep the cramps at bay but I drank a ridiculous amount of electrolyte drinks, refilling a 500ml soft flask at almost every aid station with either a high5 tab or a Hammer Nutrition Endurolyte tab. Ended up using 7 electrolyte tablets though the 100km.


The problem is (I think) this caused me to have GI issues from about the 80km mark meaning I really struggled to get in any fuel for the remaining 20km and caused me to vomit once (with two tactical chunders).


I was wondering if anyone out there had used their sweat tests to dial in their salt/electrolyte needs and if there were any real world reviews. I've tried Web searching but only get results for their products and not the tests themselves. Its around £125 to get the test done and I really want to avoid dropping that money on it if I'm not going to get useable results.


I've got a 100 miler coming up in a couple of months and I don't want to have to rely on the scattergun approach of just forcing in tonnes of salt tabs in the hopes that I'll get the balance right between no cramps/ no GI issues.

So I want to request as much testing as possible beyond a blood panel at my next appt with a new doctor. I've already had lung and asthma testing, full allergy panel, ekg, and blood panel - none have turned up any conditions.

A little background: I'm training for a 100-mile race in a couple months and had my most extreme case of this issue this weekend on a long run (~26 miles) at high elevation in the mountains. The elevation, terrain, some fatigue and the heat no doubt all factored in, but nothing about this run was beyond what I'm used too.

The issue (short version): occasionally during runs (not necessarily long or hard runs) I get to a point where my heart rate spikes significantly while going uphill, even at a slow pace on moderate grade. It got to a point this weekend where I had to sit down and lay down on the trail multiple times before continuing on (which has never happened before). Legs and the rest of my body were completely fine, but my heart rate spiked so high and my lungs felt so tight that I couldn't catch a breath, and I felt this overwhelming sleepiness. I felt like I could have gone to sleep right there on the hillside. Other issues were nausea, dizziness, blurry vision and some shakiness in my hands that was fixed by taking some electrolyte tabs.

This is a very condensed version of it, but it's happened several times now and does not seem to be directly related to anything like elevation, training volume, length of run, overall fitness, etc. No doctor has yet turned up anything. Again, not looking for medical advice, diagnoses, etc. I'll be seeing a Dr again and am looking for tests to request related to cardiovascular or other issues related to ultrarunning and training.

TLDR: heart rate spikes significantly occasionally on runs to a point that causes dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, and sleepiness. Not directly related to fitness, type or length of run, or any other factors that I can identify. What medical tests do I request from the Dr beyond blood panel, allergies and asthma?",1626025007

ultrarunning,pigandbadger,Injury question,"Injury - 6 weeks after 100km and still can’t run over 4 miles

So 6 weeks ago I ran 100km road ultra. I mainly run on trails but due to lack of events I gave this a go. Finished it and was in a bit of pain but nothing major, assumed just normal wear and tear.

A few days later and the pain and uncomfortableness was mostly gone. I ran 10 days after and had to stop after 4 miles due to pain around and in my left knee, (on the left side of it and round to the back of the knee). I’ve been getting physio and they have given my strengthening exercises (single-leg bulgarian split squat, glute bridge walk out and a few others and been doing squats and a few machines in the gym). I don’t seem to have any real improvement as I still can’t run any further and the pain returns if I go over 4 miles. The physio tells me to continue to run 2 or 3 times a week to build it up + the strengthening. Due to lack of improvement..my question is - 

Should I continue to run or would total rest be better?

It is always better to do strengthening work for rehab or would rest be better?

I hate resting but feel like just doing nothing for 2 weeks might be worth a go as I feel I'm getting nowhere. I know any answers will be best guesses as there is only limited information but any help/experience is really appreciated!",1625989811

ultrarunning,cutepajamas,Looking for watch to replace dead 735XT,"Hello! 

So, my 735XT died after slightly over a year of use, and of course garmin told me (very politely) to suck it up and buy a new watch. So I'm looking for a watch to replace it, preferably not garmin.

==Things I need (I'm assuming things like GPS tracking, a bunch of basic data fields and so on are already in):

\-48h battery life in GPS mode with HR sensor on (Want to use it for at least 5 years and the battery on these things degrades ridiculously fast. This will let me do \~100 milers 6-7 years from now, which is what I expect the watch to last). I would settle for less if the watch keeps the HR sensor on while charging.

\-Solid construction. The 735 \*looks\* solid but I'm really disappointed on it. I want something that lasts. 

\-Good enough software platform (I know this is a pipe dream, but garmin connect is so unstable that I'll take literally anything else as long as I have a way of transferring my data)

\-Wrist HR sensor (Bonus points if it works better than the one in the 735. The bar is pretty low)

==Nice-to-haves:

\-Multisport. If not I'm OK stopping/starting activities, I don't care about this that much.

\-Inline skating, climbing, other profiles available. On the 735 I had to manually edit all activities that weren't on a very short list every time and it got very annoying very fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of cheesed off at the current state of gps watches, tbh. The only thing that matters is the dang battery life, and whenever they upgrade that they put so many useless gimmicks in the things that the battery drains faster and the watch ends up struggling to last for an entire long run after a year or two. I've been looking at some of them and they put a music player in some models. A FRIGGIN MUSIC PLAYER. Sick of being skinned for a tool I need for training, I wish someone made a basic running watch with a huge-ass battery and zero gimmicks.

I Intend to crank up the volume to around 40-50 mpw  for preparing for the full.

It comes only in S/M or M/L and I’ve gone with the smaller one but it’s still slightly too big - figure if I can hook to the top and bottom of the 6x tiny loops on the sternum joint (instead of hooking to the 2 x mid-way loops - which is the only option allowed on the pack ATM due to the hook being immovable) then it might feel more secure and less buoyed out from my upper back as is currently the case

Also - anyone tried to modify this pack yet in terms of a snugger fit for smaller torso ppl ? 

Thanks all!

Oh - and I can offer advice about the Fastpack 25 vs XA25 question 

I bought both to try - S/M in both but the UD pack fits much better than Saloman in this size. However the UD seems to jolt around more than the S. Also - huge design flaw with the UD is that the bladder goes inside the pack meaning that u actually have to unpack the whole bag to refill it! That’s pretty much ruled it out for me - and I’m now about 90% sure I’ll stick with the XA25 despite being a bit too big - and in the hope i can find a way to modify it to better fit without stuffing anything up

Oh other flaw with FP25 is that it has annoying velcro on the main bag closure so yr woollen sleeves or delicate ultra light gear gets snagged on the way in/out 
And it’s front strap storage is awful compared to the XA25

But hat off to UD for making a size that fits a medium sized female body vs Saloman who have (in perhaps a sexist, or at least careless, fashion) made the smallest size too big for most female ultra",1625559532

ultrarunning,swampsensei,Exercise-induced hematuria,"Greetings all.

Let's talk about pee for a minute if you don't mind. I hope there are no weird formatting things with this as I am posting on mobile. 

Today, after dropping out of a 50k with significant vert in high temperatures, I experienced what I briefly suspected to be exercise induced hematuria. According to [this article](https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/exerciseinduced-hematuria-va-116.htm), this condition is also called ""runners bladder."" A quick search of the sub finds no discussion of this condition that apparently affects us on the reg.

I discovered this condition during a frantic Google search after the darkest pee of my life. My first thoughts were something serious, but I have no other symptoms and generally feel fine, all things considered. From my understanding, if my kidneys were failing or other serious condition, I would be experiencing dizziness or confusion and likely wouldn't be able to post on reddit or type this up. Until I dove down the dark brown urine rabbit hole, I had never heard of exercise induced hematuria and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this.

For what it's worth, I dropped because I threw up a few times and really didn't feel like gutting out nausea while trudging up the mountain again for the last ten miles. With the coloration of my urine, clearly this was a good decision. If you're curious, I peed only once about an hour and a half into the run and dropped about 6 and a half hours in. My next pee was the dark brown urination about an hour after I dropped. Now, about two hours post initial panic, urine is back to stereotypically healthy color. 

It's much more likely that I am/was just abnormally dehydrated, but, usually, I get a massive headache when I'm severely dehydrated. No headache today plus this is an interesting medical condition I've never heard of that I'm curious about.

And the idea of sprinting at that point feels like I’d pull something. I can shorten my stride and be ok. Just did a 17er two days ago but couldn’t have gone much more. 
My question- does something like this strike you as injury or weakness? In other words, is rest what’s needed, or strength training (obv both to some extent)? Feels like it must be weakness because it doesn’t bug me in early miles… yet Just 8 weeks ago I was completing 20+ mile runs regularly without a problem around 8 min/mi pace (so that would pointing to this being injury).

First time attempt at WSER over the weekend and it didn't go well.  Looking to vent and maybe get some advice.  Was going OK through mile 45, then it all fell apart for a variety of reasons.  The climb up to Devil's Thumb had me delirious.  I looked at my phone and forgot where I was.  That made me worried for my safety.  

I was worried about that happening again and falling off the trail and dying! Even after ""recovering"" at the aid station at the top of the hill, I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  When I got to the bottom (mile 52) at the next aid station, I sat for about 30 minutes, came very close to dropping because I knew it was a big climb to the next spot. An angel at the aid station convinced me to walk out with her.  

Quickly passed her, made it to Michigan Bluff in the dark, got a pacer, but still couldn't get out of my bad headspace.  Instead of running, I was just complaining and walking.  Made it to Forest hill as they were blowing the airhorn which ended my race.

Looking back, I'm so frustrated.  My legs were fine.  My body was fine.  I still moved through 15 miles and 3 aid stations after mentally quitting at 47.  I absolutely could have made it to Forest hill and onwards, but I just couldn't mentally convince myself to keep going.  Yes, my fear at the time was valid, but I should have been able to move past it eventually.  I was not prepared for the heat &amp; hills of the day.

My 2nd marathon was part of my training. It went really well, but since then, it’s felt a bit of a mental and physical slog. I’m enjoying my runs less, I had a few niggles and injuries leading up 


I don’t do any other fitness work. I am also a trans woman on HRT and have naturally lost a lot of strength. So depletion of strength/tempo plus upping mileage feels like it is making everything mentally and physically harder 


There is a 50 miler in 7 weeks I am tempted to do, and then take a long break, focus on gym work, try something new and try get some of my strength back, with maybe a low weekly mileage of 20 miles a week to stay ticking over

ultrarunning,chocochippy24,Trying to be a more supportive friend to my ultra runner bff,"Hi all, I'm looking for a little advice for how to be a better supportive friend, and/or balance my worry with encouragement! This is about my best friend and roommate.

A little over 2 years ago my roommate M (23F at the time) got into ultra running. Since then she has run 3 official 50ks, a 50 miler, 100k, 24hr race, and she just completed a 12 hr race this last weekend. She has placed in some of these, and done generally well in others. She is a strong runner and very mentally tough, and I'm impressed by her perseverance and general character. She is used to getting called crazy for her interest in ultras, and I have made an effort to understand her and not call her crazy. I have gone to every one of her races and crewed her, and I paced her for a few laps this last weekend. I feel invested in her running and want to see her succeed. I'm a casual runner, never gone more than a half marathon myself.

However, after training for her 50 miler she began struggling with shin splints and has not found a great permanent solution (she has tried PT but doesnt really stick with it). For the last 6ish months she has geared her training back quite a bit, trying to give her legs a break. It seems to have worked, as she ran a marathon, half marathon, and 12hr race (56 mi total) within the last 6 weeks with no shin splints. However, she did NO training for these (no idea how she did well in these races, but happy for her anyway). 

She will be training for a 100 mile race coming up in September, but I am worried for her. I want to believe that she knows her body best, but I have watched her take 6+ ibuprofen on consecutive days when she has runs to try to control the shin splints. She is not totally honest with her coach about the pain because she wants to be strong and push through. 

Over the last few weeks I have started feeling like a nag. I have been discouraging her from signing up for more races in the summer, and I am scared that she will hurt herself again in the training for this 100 mi race. She is inspired by her ability to push past her mental limits, but I'm worried that she is going to find a physical limit she cant push by that will cause lasting damage. 

Sorry for the long post, but I find context here relevant. Do any of you have advice on how to stay supportive? Do I just have to accept that it's her body to push hard, and I'm not responsible for her overtraining? Is there any advice you ever received that made you reconsider overtraining?",1624302495

I'm hoping it is a cartilage issue, apparently a variety of runners knee where the cartilage softens and might need six week to heal. This theory of mine is strengthened by the fact the pain doesn't seem to be localized, it seems to be inside the knee but across the whole cross section of the knee, which is pretty much where cartilage is.

The knee tracks out of alignment with muscle imbalances and this can cause issues with healing apparently.

How do I diagnose a muscle imbalance between glutes, quads, hamstrings?

I mean I like poles during climbing. Not only physically but especially mentally. When you have yet another climb and your legs are already very tired it's great that you have some support from your poles. Without poles I don't look forward to climbing, with poles I really don't mind.

However, I do like the 'free running' experience without poles. Have your hands free, especially during descent or technical parts my poles tend to get in my way. Plus the terrain here goes from climb to descent all the time so I really don't have time to constantly retract my poles, put them away and then 5 minutes later I need them again.

This is my first post here and I'm hoping to get some feedback on understanding why my first 50k didn't go as well as I was hoping. I would really appreciate any and all honest feedback!

I ran the War Hammer 50k in central Kentucky on June 12 last week. The course track was a roughly 27k out-and-back for a total of 54k or 33.6 miles and about 4,200 feet of gain and loss. The high temperature for the day was about 86 degrees with 80% humidity for a heat index of about 99 F.

At about 15 miles, I started feeling my calves and groins wanting to cramp - I thought this may have been due to low electrolytes, so I took 2 GU Roctane electrolyte pills and continued. I hit the turn-around in second place after 2 hours and 45 minutes, feeling great in terms of my energy and cardiovascular system, but a bit nervous about the crampy sensations. Actual full-on cramps starting occuring at about mile 19 in my groins and calves, and the heat and humidity became really intense at the same time. This slowed me down significantly, but I came into the aid station at mile 21 in second place with a 10-15 minute lead on third still feeling so-so - like I definitely needed to slow down and get fluids in, but that I would continue running strong after a short break at the station.

This is where things started to go wrong. I took 2 GU pills, 2 shots of pickle juice and drank a small cup of Coke - the latter two I never tried during my training. After about ten minutes at the station, I started walking back on the track, but after about a mile, I got extremely nauseous - stomach hurting so badly that I had to sit down for about 20 minutes, until finally, I puked up every bit of the fluids and calories I put in my stomach at the aid station. It didn't seem like my body absorbed anything from my gut in this window, but I felt significantly better after puking, so I continued on walking the 6 miles to the final aid station. The 32 oz of fluids I had with me was not enough for this distance after purging all the fluids from the last aid station however, and when I tried to get GU's in, these also made me extremely nauseous. The nausea was so painful to the point that my new goal was to simply finish and to not DNF.

Basically no running happened in these 6 miles to the next aid station. Here, a similar situation played out - tried to carefully get some fluids and sugar in, felt extremely nauseous, puked everything up after 15 or 20 minutes. After this, I was actually able to eat a couple bowls of potato chips and drink some water and felt good enough that I set out for the last 6 miles. However, after about a mile, same situation - severe nausea, and symptoms of dehydration or heat exhaustion due to my inability to take in fluids. After a VERY slow 3 or so miles, I puked up everything left in my stomach, and felt marginally better such that I could walk the rest of the way in and finish the race in 9.5 hours.

In my training, I regularly used GU Roctane gels, and never had a hint of nausea from them, and had a multitude of runs in high humidity, but not in the combination of heat and humidity that we were in during this race. I also did not get quite the training I wanted to, due to unexpected life things that came up and multiple injuries that I didn't resolve until about 4 weeks before the race. All my training was on technical, rocky trails with my longest run being 17 miles and 2,000 feet of gain, with 13-15 11-12 mile runs with 800-1500 feet of gain.

If you read this whole thing, thanks! I really appreciate it. Overall, I think the nausea is what destroyed me. Because of the nausea, I was not able to get fluids or calories to absorb from my stomach after about mile 22. What I really want to know is how to learn from this and prevent it, as well as the muscle cramping, from happening in the future. Respiratory and energy-wise I felt great until my stomach started rejecting everything I put in it. Based on the details, do you all have any advice on what I did wrong and how to prevent nausea and cramps in the future? Also, is it possible despite the hot and humid conditions that I could have over-compensated and consumed too much salt? I was thinking this is what could have upset my stomach in the first place, between the salt pills and pickle juice.

TLDR: Ran first 50k, all was going well until about 22 miles in where cramps and major nausea set in. Struggled to walk the last 11 miles of the race due to dehydration and what I suspect was heat exhaustion, because I couldn't keep any food or fluids down whatsoever. All advice appreciated.",1623900752

I will take a Clif bar or 2 in case I need them and there will be well stocked aid stations for extras. I have tried the gels I am using in training and haven’t had any issues (yet…). However, I don’t typically eat or drink during runs except when I was testing the gels so I’m not sure when I should start taking on calories.

ultrarunning,keepitboreal,Rhecovering from Rhabdo - any insight?,"Curious to know if anyone has any knowledge to drop about the outlook for someone recovering from a case of exertional Rhabdomyolysis.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday, after an abnormally busy Spring, I got a little over-excited on my first big day out in the mountains for the season. I had been running a decent amount (60 mpw) but mostly on roads. 35 mountain miles and 18,000 ft of climbing later, I landed myself in the hospital with a case of Rhabdo. I was only in for about 24 hours of IV fluids, and am out now, feeling mostly normal, just a little tired, legs are a little sore, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the proper place to ask questions about this is with my doctor, but doctors tend to be more concerned with things like kidney function than running performance. So my question is this: from a running perspective, what should I expect the recovery to be like? Is it just a matter of waiting until running feels okay and then easing into it based on feel? Or do I need to be super-duper-extra-careful? Or should I expect that all my muscles tissue is dead and returning to running is going to be a slow and discouraging process? I haven't really been able to find a concrete answer to what exactly will happen to my muscles after the enzyme levels return to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

On a related note: After the Rhabdo symptoms go away, do I still benefit from the rather large training stimulus? Or do I miss out on any strengthening because I crossed a certain threshold of destroying my muscles?

ultrarunning,drifterlately,Cramping,"Just finished my first ultra, a 50k with ~3,500ft of elevation.

I’ve been training pretty hard (I think), 40-45mpw, at least 5,000ft per week, and did a 27 mile run with 4,700ft a month ago, so I thought I could do it.

During my race, I got leg cramps so badly, worse than I’ve ever experienced. I was in pain the whole time and honestly, it took all the enjoyment from the race.

Luckily, I finished at my bare minimum pace I set for myself, but honestly was expecting to do a lot better. I’m actually pretty bummed. 

I tapered my runs and didn’t run for two days before the race. I hydrated, ate typical food, and electrolytes.

I drank a lot of water (two glasses with nuun tablets) before the race. Is overhydrating a thing? I sweated more in the first 10 miles than I think I’ve ever sweat before. The weather was cool and cloudy and not a factor.

I don’t normally take in a ton of electrolytes during running, because I’ve just never felt cramping. Usually cramps are a day later in the form of tight/soreness. This race, I was trying everything they had at the aid stations, pickles, salt tabs, electrolyte mixes. I think they helped me survive, but damn I’m just so upset with myself.

I’m so happy I did the race and I’m really grateful for the opportunity, just feel like I let myself down. I wasn’t sure I wanted to sign up for another ultra after this one (wanted to stick to half marathon trail races for a while), but now I feel I have to, just to prove to myself I can.

ultrarunning,t4feri,"Not-race report: Cold River Loop FKT (Adirondacks, NY)","**Background**

I was a D1 walk-on college runner wayyyy back in 2006, but never really ran seriously in the decade or so prior to COVID shutdowns recently aside from random sign-ups for 10K's here and there that never really means sustained mileage or training. When my preschool (teaching job), gym, and other hobbies all got wiped away in March 2020, though, I figured... why not?

I had some solid enough residual speed from general fitness -- got a 21:XX 5K TT a few months in as well as a 1:53 HM. Aside from some trial-and-error to figure out how the hell to run through the freezing cold and pitch black darkness that defined our Syracuse winter, I kept logging miles and improving at various distance TTs as I rolled into 2021; by April of this year I had an 18:XX 5K, 1:25 HM, and was consistently running 70 miles a week.

Then the ultra bug bit me. I saw a local trail 50K with open spots for the middle of the month, not even two weeks out -- hey, why the hell not. I ran [3:59 in the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mtb87r/first_50k_ultra_35930_with_an_asterisk/), but made an early navigation flub and got DQ'd from the results. Still, tons of fun and super happy with the result. The next closest not-waitlisted ultra I could find was over in Long Island in May -- that one turned into a [slower 4:45 over some rough roots and stair stretches but much more successful result at first overall](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/n8ecbh/greenbelt_50k_on_long_island_1st_overall/), earning me free Salomon trail shoes and a chunky plaque. 

As June approached, no nearby races really fit with my schedule, so I turned to the trail descriptions of FKT. I bought a Salomon chest pack and tried it out on an [unsupported marathon-ish length run in the Winona State forest](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/winona-state-forest-ny), with some navigation and new pack hiccups slowing me down a bit from a quicker goal but still doing enough to earn the FKT by just under 15 minutes.

**NY/NE mountains**

I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I was never really a trail *runner*, but I'd done plenty of day hikes, a little backpacking, paved and gravel biking over big mountains, some winter skiing... lots of time up in Mt. Hood and the Cascades. Mountains? Cool, I like mountains.

Then I got to Syracuse. Shortly after moving in, wife and I planned a 3-day trip to NH's White Mountains, one of the seemingly more recommended options in our greater area. And it suuuuuuuuuuucked. Waist high (or worse) rock scrambling defined basically every single substantial climb. When you weren't doing that you were very often walking down a literal creek bed, either dry and made up entirely of basketball-sized rocks, or still full of running water. Gross.

We try a couple Adirondack options, slightly closer to us, and find basically the same thing. Well, shit. I guess we're city people now, with occasional dalliances to small, non-mountainous parks and forests.

**The Cold River Loop**

The breaking point that had both of us saying, *lol fuck no*, to coming back to the Adirondacks actually happened on some of the same trails that made up my FKT attempt last June. I'm pretty sure I thought and said I was never coming back... but... that was before I found out I could have my name published on the internet! Fame, fortune! My wife rolls her eyes when I tell her where and what I'm gonna be doing for my next big run.

Also, the loop skips the mountains themselves -- from what I'm readying it's 29 miles with ballpark 2,500 feet of elevation, divided into three manageable climbs and some smaller rollers. So I won't have rock scrambling... just plenty of little and medium ones. The current fastest time is 5:36, just about 11:30/mile pace -- I figure I can knock an hour or so off that, right? Right?

It's hot as fuck and disgustingly humid in Syracuse the week before my trip up there, but forecast for the trailhead area looks much nicer. I figure out how to mount a 1.5L bladded in my small Salomon pack (on the last FKT I'd used a 1L flask in the back and it sucked to swap/refill mid-run), pick up my usual snacks, buy some 100% DEET spray, and take a vacation day off of teaching to wake up at 5:15 and start my drive up north.

**lol, pace**

The first mile of the day is +290 feet elevation or so -- just about the toughest of the day, but relatively smooth surfaces and fair stuff. I come through in 9:44 and think, OK cool, nice and easy and I can drop down to my long run pace (8:00-8:30) on some of the easier miles. My pack with 2.5L of total fluids and some miscellaneous crap is heavy but fitting comfortably. There's some little rocks, roots, and stream crossings breaking up my flow but I get to \~10K at about 9:30 pace, right around what I'd need to do to beat the current time by a full hour.

Then there's the first big swamp. I tip-toe across branches that other visitors have draped across the muck, losing a minute or two, and then get a sustained climb as a reward afterwards. Next mile split comes in 11:50, hmph. And the trail is starting to get increasingly overgrown -- I'm catching spiderwebs in the face and all sorts of bush and tree branches to the shins and forearms. Hmph.

**Bushwhacking**

And the overgrowth only gets worse when I diverged from the ""main"" mountain ascent route. I keep hoping that the various plants I'm running through are only growing *into* the trail so I can successfully plow through them, which thankfully turns out to be true. But it's still rooted and rocky under the thick brush cover, only now I can't reliably see it -- so on a mostly downhill stretch from mile 12 through 16 I start splitting 12's and 13's, with more power-walking than true running.

I'm staying upright at least, with this cautious approach. Did I mention I'm miles away from cell coverage and I have no idea if anyone else is going to cross through this trail today (or tomorrow, or the next day)? Safety absolutely takes priority over pace. One benefit (well, the only benefit) is that I'm still feeling very fresh -- when the trail does start to clear up a bit, I easily shift back into low 9:00 pace for miles 17 and 18.

**Thou shalt not hurdle at mile 25**

I get to the 2/3rds-point feeling solid enough, but a little bit hungry. My legs and stomach are mad at each other and I'm struggling to eat/drink while running, so I start to run the flat/smooth bits than fuel while walking the overgrown and rock-covered bits. The trail is certainly better now than it was an hour ago, but don't worry -- still plenty of un-runnable stretches to give me time to take in some sustenance.

I start to think about FKT pace for the first time in a while as I get down to 8, 7, 6 miles to go. My run-walk mix is still rattling off miles faster than the average pace of the current leader. I think about a couple of round-number milestones and what I need to do to bring my average pace to under 10:00 for the day (finish the last 10K in 8:55 pace, not happening unless it's somehow on a high school track). OK, sub-5 hours? Maybe with some low 9:XX miles -- the trail is looking better and better now, but I haven't seen another human being in two-plus hours at this point. There's downed trees or large branches every 100 or 200 meters; I try to jump over a very small one and nearly wipe out, and rethink that idea. Carefully stepping over them? Sounds good. No sub-5, though.

**The end**

I get a little morale boost from seeing a hiker with 5K to go, then two more. The last \~1.2 miles is stuff I'd seen at the very start of the day, and I laugh at morning-me thinking that this stretch of trail was the ""bad"" part of the day I should be running conservatively. I register a 5:04:40 and see my glorious Subaru with dry clothes, fresh water, and an internal combustion engine that will (hours later) get me back to a shower and couch. I get pizza slices *and* McDonald's in Tupper Lake, then have an uncomfortable 3.5-hours on my butt in the driver's seat before arriving back home.

In two weeks I've got my last day of preschool teaching for the year, followed by a [last man standing-style ultra](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=79693) local in Syracuse.

Anyone got any experience training with them and fancies sharing some learned wisdom? 

I've seen mixed reports on training with them: some said don't train too much with them or you won't have the legs but I'm of the opinion that that's wrong. I've used them once so far for a 25km 1500m elev. run and was absolutely dying, so sense says training should be specific to using the poles in the race and the upper body needs to adapt to the extra energy expenditure.

ultrarunning,nowaythisisunique,Running Leadville 50SR next month and have some questions,"A little about me and my training as it pertains to the questions I’ve got. I’m in the Houston area. I’ve got 5x 50 miles weeks leading up to the taper. Starting training specifically for this race in January with over 650 miles. I’ve trained for marathons in 2019 and early 2020. This is my first Ultra. 

Maybe a question more for sea level dwellers or flat landers, but….

1. Coming from lower elevation, how did you feel at altitude for the race? If you can include # of days you tried to acclimate.

Maybe 1a. How much time do you think it added to your expected average pace/mi.? I’m trying to figure out what a reasonable time would be. It sounds like sub 9:59 finish seems doable on paper and Alger at goal, but looking at previous finishers times from my area, most are around 12hrs. Trying to manage expectations.

2. Any previous finishers can chime in on weather that surprised them? Ie. Cold in the morning and hot in the valleys, and cold at peaks. 

3. How many miles did you do training specifically for previous SR50?

4. How much vert specific training did you do? Either in a parking garage or treadmill. I’m a flat lander and had to use a treadmill. 

Thank you for any thoughtful or helpful replies. I’m anxious, have my doubts but really excited for this race. Most days I feel ready, but on bad run days those bad thoughts creep up. I don’t have anyone local that has attempted this distance, let alone the altitude and elevation to bounce these questions off.",1623351149

### Background
So I started running about 8 years ago, doing a mile on the treadmill a couple of times a week, trying to lose weight. I slowly picked up running more often and further distances, but never anything further than a half marathon.

In 2018 I became interested in alpinism/mountaineering, learned a lot more about training theory and started keep better track of my fitness.

In 2019, I ran my first marathon the Reykjavik Marathon, I followed the [BAA level 3 training program](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/levelthree), mixed in with some of the lessons I learned from mountaineering training. Finishing that marathon was an incredible experience for me, it was such a monumental task, the weeks of following a training plan had added up to something incredible.

I had always been interested in ultras, and knew it was something I wanted and needed in my life. I had a few races I wanted to attempt in 2020, but Covid shut that down. Also, at the time I was located in Boston, and did not have a car, so getting vertical was always a bit tougher on the few trail runs I got out to.

Fast forward to 2021, I moved to the PNW.

### Training
I have read enough research papers, published studies, articles, reddit posts, and books (Training for the Uphill Athlete &amp; Running your First Ultramarathon) that I thought I generally had a good grasp of how to set up my own training plan, especially one that meshes with the flux of my life and can adapt with me.

The second half of 2020 was really bad for my running, but 2021 started strong. I got back into the joy of running, and by mid February I knew I was ready to start training for something bigger. I found a 50K (Ridge Route Ultra) which got moved to June 5th, which would give me ~12 weeks to ramp up training and mileage. I picked up the weekly mileage. From about mid march, I picked it up to 30-40mpw. I would aim to get 3-4 aerobic runs during the week, anywhere between 4-8 miles depending on the day. The weekends were either a trail run, or a long road run. 

April is when things started feeling more serious, I received my 2nd Covid vaccine dose at the beginning of the month and it put me off of running for a couple of days, but I eased back in to it. By mid April I was feeling good, but a bit scared by the distance, I knew I was capable, but I needed to break the mental barrier, on April 25th, I committed to running a road marathon training run (ended up with 26.7mi). I felt pretty good after, I took the few days after to do some easy active recovery runs, never letting my hart rate or pace sneak up, I felt solid. 

Now its May, 1 month to the race, two weeks after my training marathon I knew I needed to get on the idea of back to back long runs, so I did 19 road miles on Saturday, and 11 road miles on Sunday, those sucked quite a bit, but it felt nice to hit 30 miles, and know what tired legs were. I had a training friend who was running a trail marathon (and her first marathon) and she was a bit scared by the distance, so the following weekend, we went out and broke that barrier for her, we ran a trail marathon, making sure to keep it easy. The elevation gain, the heat, and the fact that I had not slept 2 nights prior made it a tough run. 

At this point I get an email from my original ultra, stating they were postponing the race to ""sometime in July."" I was too committed to June 5th, and to a 50k, so I began searching, but decided to run the Trail Marathon with my training partner. But needed something to scare me a bit, something a bit tougher, so I made the personal decision to add on some ""bonus miles"" to the race.

The following week, I added in some intervals and some stair climbing on back to back days, this hit my legs hard, but by the weekend I was back to feeling fresh. I was blown away by generally how well I was recovering, so I went out for another road marathon training run. This one took me through a slightly darker mental place, it felt harder mentally, but still doable. This run really helped make the marathon distance less scary, I know I can do it I just need to push the vertical, this was also the last big week before the taper began.

I dropped my mileage a very slightly for week 1 of a 2 week taper, introducing some hill repeats as my last ""hard"" running effort.

Week 2 of taper, or race week, I climbed Mt St Helens on Tuesday, felt tired on Wednesday, and didnt manage my time wisely on Thursday or Friday, so no more runs were had, Race Day was here.


### Pre-race
Race morning I woke up 2 hours before the race, grabbed a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee from McDonald's (the sandwich might have been a mistake). My girlfriend dropped off my training partner and I at the starting area, we grabbed out shirts and bibs, and hung out in the warm car. I look around, wondering if I overpacked my vest, I brought 1500 calories worth of snacks, 2 liters of water, my trusty Norvan SL, an emergency bivy, and my garmin in reach. The last two items might seem like overkill, but after the incident in China, I felt a few extra grams were more than worth it.

### Race
The race only had 40 participants for the marathon, I figured it would be a bit thin during the race. We get counted down, a few people fly off the line, we are starting up hill, into some snow patches; its cold, windy, and I haven't decided if that breakfast sandwich is going to come out of either end in a mile. 

Normally it takes me 1-3 miles to ""settle in"" to let my breathing, my heart rate, and my legs figure out that we are in this for a while. The first 3 miles gained about 500 feet vertical, not awful by any means, but all of the factors added up to making me wonder if this was a mistake. Mile 3-11 were all generally downhill, but the sandwich sat in my stomach, a constant reminder of a potential mistake. My training partner and I had communicated well in advance that we weren't going to actively run together, if one of us felt better, we had no qualms splitting off. But our paces matched, at mile 7 we talked about how we hadn't ""settled in"" yet and how it was a bit strange. But suddenly things sort of clicked, we picked up 2-3 other friends and made a solid middle pack. 

Mile 12 had a couple of aggressively sharp elevation spikes, this is when I remembered ""trail running is sometimes hiking, and sometimes walking."" Mile 13-16 had us lose over 700 feet, blasting down those hills felt incredible, the high cadence running downhill felt great.

Mile 18 had an aid station where I topped off with about 1 liter of tailwind because I knew the next 9 miles were going to be hot, and a non stop climb.

Our pack of runners all quickly ran out of words and just settled in for the continuous uphill climb, which finally broke with about a quarter mile to spare on the race, all we had left was a nice wide downhill to the finish. We all broke out into a run, and then a sprint to the finish line, crossing it felt amazing. Completing the race, getting back to in person events, cheering on other runners, I missed that. 

But my run wasn't over...

### ""Post""-race
My girlfriend was waiting for me in the parking lot, she was dressed for a run. She offered to put my vest in her car, but I felt that was against the spirit of the unnecessarily contrived goal I was going for. We started running laps around the parking lot, laps that were ~.2 mi. I made a point of not trying to look at pace, distance, or keep track of how many laps we were doing. I looked down at my watch, when I crossed the 30 mile mark, did another lap and that's when I figured out each lap was ~.2mi. those last 5 laps felt so long. I was mentally ready to stop. Finally we approached the car again, I had 31.25 on the watch, broke the 50K and stopped moving for the first time in quite a while. 

It was an incredible journey to get there, I loved everyone and everything it took to get there. Now on to another goal, maybe equally as contrived. A lot of people helped me get to where I was going, but huge thanks to /u/TylerCAndrews you are an incredible athlete and have definitely inspired me to keep pushing harder with running and in the mountains.

I have done somewhere between 6-10 50ks, and a couple of supported FKTs around 45 miles in distance. I am competitive at these events, I've placed in the top 3 for my gender at several 50ks and successfully claimed FKTs.

This year I decided to train for a 100 miler and I have been following a training plan pretty religiously since November for that. I've missed maybe 3 runs from the entire training plan since then. I have completed many 75+ mile weeks, long runs over 30 miles, back-to-back long runs etc. The 100k this weekend was my qualifying race.

I knew it would be tough since 100k is the furthest distance I have ever run, but words can't even tell you how crummy I still feel (it's Monday morning now, the race was Saturday). I still pretty much can't walk. My feet are still massively swollen and a couple of major muscle groups in my legs just basically don't work at all.

ultrarunning,haiSOOOOdesu,Walking vs Running (Beginner Query),"Hi all, first some background: I have my first ultra in a couple of weeks at the UK Race to the King. It’s 53 miles over hilly terrain with approx. 5,000 feet of altitude gain. I have been training c. 50 miles per week for a few months and lately have shifted my training away from flat running more towards trails and hills, so I think I should be more or less good to go. I’m shooting for around 9-10 hours, but that is probably too ambitious. My “B” goal is under 12 hours and my “C” goal is avoiding a DNF - quite a wide range given the unknowns involved in a first ultra!

For reference, I have a 1:27 HM PB but haven’t run a competitive marathon before - I started running last year to cope with lockdowns like many others I’m sure! My longest training run (or any run) so far is 22 miles, but I am planning to do 30 miles today as my final long run before tapering for the race.

As the race as drawn nearer, I have been researching ultra running a bit more and noticed that a lot of resources recommend walking uphill sections to save your legs/lungs. In my training I have tried to avoid this other than for scheduled walking/eating “breaks” or if my heart rate has really spiked. 

My questions are: if I am shooting for the best time that I am capable of (whatever than may be), should I be walking the hills to save my legs?

To explain a little, in general rhabdo is system wide muscle breakdown but different from typical muscle soreness. In extreme cases it can cause bruises and kidney damage (marked by dark urine or peeing blood). Mine never gets that far. After about 60 miles I experience full body pain on impact while running. It will get worse the longer I run, does not respond to ibeprophen,  but will be completely gone the next day. My doctor (okay, husband/ doctor) has generally diagnosed me with mild rhabdo. At first I thought I was under trained for the distances I was attempting but this year I'm much much stronger and still seem to be experiencing the same pain levels at the same distances. I can find very little in the literature having to do with endurance athletes 

I ran a 100 miler last weekend and was unable to run the last 20 miles but my quads, hamstrings, calves never even got sore the way they do if I run a hard effort 50k.

The whole race I felt terrible. Really achy legs / feet and my hear rate keep spiking to 170 even when I was walking at the end. I felt like I had already ran 30 miles by mile 10. By mile 17 I decided I would DNF at the next aid station and the next and 4 more miles of mostly walking I ended the race at 21 miles.

I think it was a mixture of not being acclimated to humidity, not drinking enough and just maybe having a bad day.

I ran a 25K the week before with more elevation at an average pace of 8:15 per mile and felt amazing

This DNF has really took a huge chuck out of my confidence. While at the time I really felt like I couldn't go any further I can't help but think I just didn't try hard enough and I could of pushed through it. I'm now second guessing my 100 miler in November.

**Where Can I Hire a Hacker to Change Grades?** 

So which brings us to the main question — Can you hire a hacker to change your grades? Yes, it is possible to hire a hacker to change your university grades and college grades. It has been done time and time again. It mainly depends on the kind of security behind your school’s system.

I had a personal experience when I was in college, I accidentally “hacked” my grade book system. On my grade book, if you clicked a teacher’s name, it would show you basic demographic information about that teacher, which was all supposed to be public. This included their work email address, to which student emails were supposed to be directed, so I frequently used it to verify that I was sending emails to the correct address.

One day, I was trying to email a teacher, and wanted to verify that I had the right email address. I opened my grade book, and logged in using the password that my browser had remembered, but it occurred to me that I had completely forgotten what that password actually was.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your University Grades**

So, I went to this teacher demographic page, and verified the email address. Afterwards, I decided to go to my own profile page to see if I could find or change my password. When I went to my profile, I noticed that, instead of my name, it said the name of the teacher whose demographic page I had just checked. And near the bottom of the page, it had a password box with the teacher’s password.

From a computer security perspective, like almost every website where you log in and out, I would assume this website had a variable which stored the name of the logged-in user. However, this was the same variable as the one that stored the name of the teacher when you went to look at demographic information.

Then, when you go to your profile, it just accesses the information of whoever is stored in the “user” variable, without using any encoded session ID or token or anything to verify that the value of the “user” variable was actually the user who had logged in. To this day, I cannot believe how awful that security was. At that age, I didn’t know any of that and had never looked at computer code before, otherwise I would have experimented to find the flaw.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades on College / University Transcript**

A few days later, the teacher went over to me to brag that he had fixed it (I think he was under the impression that I had intentionally found the exploit as a white-hack or something). The layout was changed and the teacher demographic page was removed. The next year, we switched to a completely new grade book system.

I’ve never heard of any grade book with such poor security standards, but there have been cases where students have hacked grade books and changed grades. These include placing a key logger on campus computers, phishing the teachers, befriending teachers and getting passwords, finding passwords on unattended computers, etc.

But, possible, legal, and moral are three different things. Is it possible for you to hack a grade book and change your grades? Probably. Is it legal? No, and it’s very rare to be able to pull that off without getting caught. If you change only your grades, if anyone ever happens to notice, you’re caught immediately. If you change a bunch of grades, the discrepancy becomes obvious, and the changes will likely be reverted.

**Best Solution to Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades**

Let’s say you’re in college, applying to an elite graduate school, so you change your grades to ensure your GPA is high enough, and you get in. That means you have automatically become qualified and actually earned admission. If you are not really left with much options, this might seem the smartest thing to do. What are you waiting for?

ultrarunning,excynimphica,Dealing with injury as an ultra runner,"I've been dealing with a knee injury for the last 5 weeks, likely a lateral tear in the patella tendon. Lots of pain increasing when I try to run. I tried PT and a special patella brace, but nothing stops the pain from returning. Next week I am getting the tendon needled to facilitate faster localized healing, after which I will not be able to do anything with the leg for a week. I'll have to build up strength walking after that.

Something I could never have imagined is the mental toll that injury can take. Over the last 2 years since I started running, I've created an identity for myself as ""the runner"" to all my friends and family. Training for a still upcoming 100k was the highlight of my year, and I know everyone was probably tired of hearing me talk about it. 

But now that I, a runner, cannot run, I feel like this identity I've created has crumbled to dust and I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate as well, I'm losing motivation to do other things, I'm starting to gain a little weight, drinking more...

Due to covid cancelling my plans to climb in the pamirs, I found a 52km race a couple hours from my place in August.  I really want to do it.  Not worried about finishing etc, I’ve completed many 50-75km runs on my own over the years but never ever done an official race. 

The longest between aid stations is around a dozen km… I’m used to carrying 3L of water with me between bladder and flasks… I won’t need to carry that much for 12km.

Am I thinking about this right? I have to wrap my head around bringing less water and less food since I’ll have aid station support for the first time ever?  Or should I keep with my current system that I know works for me… (I would definitely say I drink much more water than average).

ultrarunning,flooredgenius,53miles after less than ideal training - last minute training tips?,"Looking for some advice, thanks in advance. I have a double marathon (53.6 miles) in two and a half weeks with 5,051ft of elevation and my training has been somewhat disrupted by life getting in the way. 

Six and a half weeks ago I ran a 6hrs15min PB 50k, and four and a half weeks ago I ran a 5hr55min PB 50k (I'm solidly mid pack) - both with similar elevation changes and on similar courses to the forthcoming double marathon. I recover fast and doing two 50ks in two weeks was fine. So I'm not being stupid in doing the double marathon. However, I usually average about 30miles a week, but that can vary from like 20miles to 45miles. Since the last 50k I've only averaged about 22miles a week, in total, with my longest run being 10miles. Which is obviously not ideal. Have got a few long hikes in in that time though.

What I am wondering is what it's worth me doing in the next two weeks? It's gone warm and sunny here (UK) and I suspect that it will be like that for the race, so I feel I should try and acclimatise a bit. But obviously at the stage I'm not going to be able to do much useful training. Is it worth a last long run? Or just keep things ticking over? My races goals are: A goal) sub-12hrs; B goal) sub-15hrs; C goal) finish. So I am not putting any pressure on myself - I just want to finish in decent shape. Any advice much appreciated.

ultrarunning,FourteenPancakes,Help me set up a tapering schedule,"Hello all! I have my first trail race/ultra planned for three weeks from now. It is a 50K with 7,400 feet of elevation gain. 10 hour cut off time for the race. My goal is to finish and have fun.

I've completed two road marathons in the past (2018/2019) in the 3:45 range. For the last 12 months I've averaged about 45 miles/week. The last several months it's been closer to 55 miles/week. I'm 49 and female.

I was training for a half marathon using Hanson's advanced. I didn't have a specific one in mind, just using the schedule. About two months ago I decided that I should train for a 50k trail race instead. I've been running the roads during the week and a long threshold run once a week. Weekends I've been hitting the trails and doing trail runs both days with a longer run on Saturday (3-7 hours) and a shorter run on Sunday (1-3 hours).  I am super slow on the trails, but have been training with some good elevation. Saturday was my longest day with 6,900 feet of elevation in 22 miles (super slow at about 19 minute miles average). I actually felt okay yesterday and did a short trail run for an hour and then went on an easy hike with the family. I feel fairly prepared at this point to do 7,400 feet in 31 miles.

ultrarunning,martijnk79,Finished first 100 miles race!,"So last weekend I've finished my first 100-mile race and I've finished quite allright. I never thought about giving up once so my experience could maybe help other people. The race was Grand Trail des Lacs et Chateaux in the Belgium Ardennes, 165km and around 7000D+ which is pretty serious for this country since it's mostly flat ([https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/](https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/)).

It took me around 31 hours to finish. I took longer then I wanted because my friend got injured at the 120k mark and they needed to evacuate him. He blew up his achilles and couldn't even walk. This was his own fault though, he trained like \~50K a month for the last 3 months so I was surprised he even made it to 120K. I wasn't going to quit because of him though and once he was safe I continued my journey alone in the middle of the night deep inside the creepy forrest where a lot of eyes were watching me :) 

I'm pretty sure this was the thoughest thing I've ever done. I mean I did Marathon des Sables in 2018 but that was relativley easy compared to this. This was so damn technical, some parts I could only go like 2-3 km/h plus staying awake for 31 hours while navigating along side dangerous cliffs and waterfalls is already a challenge on it's own.

Nutricion is def. the most important thing during a race like this. My body was just screaming for food the entire time. I had cliff bars as fuel and sometimes I took around 3 in 1 hour! Insane.... I'm so sick of them right now I can probably never eat them again.

The second most important thing is water and salt. I was drinking a lot and I also had sodium tablets which contained salt and magnesium that I took like every 20K. I was also eating salted foods at the checkpoints (mostly chips and chicken soup) and had around 15 bananas total. I am a salty sweater though, I knew this from MDS where I took a salt tablet every 30 min. My entire backpack was white of my sweat.

I did pee every once in a while and looked at the color. If it became dark yellow I took more salt and drank more water until it was light yellow again. I managed this really well and felt great the entire race. I also had a lot of coca cola at the checkpoints for my cafeine needs :)

Right now my body is totally exhausted but I do feel great. I still can't believe I've finished a 100-mile race, I never thought I could do this. It just seemed impossible but a decent amount of training, preperation and good management of nutricion and I have my 6 ITRA points :)",1622449092
ultrarunning,catsandcoffee16,Race Report: Bryce Canyon 50k (my first ultra!),"**Pre-race**
This may have been the hardest thing I have EVER done. Starting on Thursday, I increased my carb intake a lot, hydrated like mad, and rolled out my legs as much as possible.

The morning of the race started out well. I was up early, ate my normal oatmeal, protein powder, and banana, and hydrated with water + nuuns and coffee. I was at the start with plenty of time to get ready and man, I was nervous, but I was also really excited.

**Start to Proctor Canyon (miles 0-3)**
The run to the first aid station was fine. It was still cool and while sandy, not difficult. I drank a bit of water, ate about 100 calories, and was still in a great mood! I did not stop at this aid station. 

**Proctor Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 3-8)**
The next trek to the second aid station was technically tricky but again, not too hard. There was a LOT of uphill on ridges and a ton of people, so this was slow. I was still feeling great! The weather was low 60s, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and taking in liquid hydration (~400cal total). By this point I had probably consumer about 1.5L of water. At this aid station I refilled my pack with water and grabbed some watermelon and grapes and just kept going. 

**Hillsdale Canyon to Red Canyon (miles 8-14)**
This was great! I felt strong and was able to keep a good pace. There were rolling hills and some ridges but nothing too technical. Again, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and liquid hydration (~400cal total). I also ate a banana since it was not hot yet and I figured I could keep it down. During this section I started using my salt tabs to prepare for the heat that was coming. I likely drank 1.5L during this section. At this aid station, I again filled up with water, got more tailwind, grabbed some applesauce and more watermelon, and kept moving. I was still in a GREAT mood, plodding along, happily running through the hoodoos. Little did I know the misery that was ahead. 

**Red Canyon back to Red Canyon (miles 14-19)**
This was the loop from hell! At this point the temperature spiked above 85F and the climb was completely exposed. It felt like it was a constant uphill along ridges, somewhat technical and VERY SLOOOOOOW. It was absolutely gorgeous, but this nearly broke me. After this I was seriously considering dropping. Making friends is what got me through this section. It was SO hard, but we were all in it together. It is amazing what having others to commiserate with can do for your state of mind. Once we were out of this loop and back on the flats, I had to walk more than I wanted. My body was just spent. Big reason, I didn’t consume enough calories. I just couldn’t deal with eating while trudging through this which was a major mistake. I likely only took in 200cal during this loop, but I think I drank 1.5L. I did take in a gel with electrolytes and caffeine. 

Back to the aid station, I grabbed a lot more water, more fuel from my drop bag, more tailwind, and went to the bathroom. I drabbed more watermelon, applesauce, and just kind of chilled for a couple minutes. This is where things started to hurt. It was HOT. I think we were going above 90 at this point and it was dragging me down. Before heading back onto the trail, I soaked my buff in cold water and poured it on my head and then wrapped the cold buff around my neck.

**Red Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 19-25)**
With the heat and the altitude, I was starting to not feel great. For the remainder of the race the temperature was above 90F with a max of 95F. Out of the aid station I just walked a lot. I took a salt pill and some water and started to feel a bit better. I was moving along though, running on the flats and downhills, and made another friend. At mile 26 though I fell and that cost me time. Other than a bruise on my left shoulder and scraping my left knee, I was fine but the swelling in the knee started to slow my pace. 

And then came another massive climb. This was unreal. We were grouping up again and EVERYONE was struggling. It was like this came out of nowhere, the heat was absolutely the contributing factor at this point. I also had my slowest mile EVER here. My left knee started to hurt, and I had to sit a couple times. I also ran into another runner who was seriously dehydrated so I stayed with her for a while, gave her a salt pill and some water, and made sure she was ok (she ended up DNFing at the aid station). The heat was seriously no joke. During this section I drank 1.5L of water, ate only 300 calories (again, major mistake but I could not take in more), and had a salt pill. 

At this aid station I refilled water (but not my hydration back, whoops!), but I don’t think I grabbed any fuel. Nothing looked good. I did think about dropping again but realized I was just being ridiculous and pushed on! 


**Hillsdale Canyon to Proctor Canyon (miles 25-30)**
We had one last climb and again, wtf. It was awful. Around mile 28, my right foot was bugging me. I was assuming I was getting a blister on the bottom and my toes were sore. This made it really hard to run so I shuffled along and basically gave up on finishing in less than 9 hours. This part was pretty uneventful. I ate another 300 calories, drank ALL the water I had on me (1L), and was so happy when the elevation was over. The run into this last aid station was magical. When I got there, it turned out there were out of water, so I grabbed some gnarly (do not recommend) and some pickles. 

**Proctor Canyon to Finish (miles 30-33.8)**
These final miles were all downhill, thank god. It was SO HOT! I ran a bit but again, shuffled along. My right foot was really bugging me but I was so excited to nearly be done. With less than 2 miles left, I started to cry. I was SO overwhelmed. I never thought I would be able to do something like this. When I saw the finish line and could hear the music, a rush of excitement came over me and I found the strength to run along the finish line. As they said my name, and announced this was my first 50k, I started to sob (all on video, lol). I was just so fucking overwhelmed by this experience. 

**THE END!**
I stopped at the medic to clean up my knees, ate a burger, Oreos, bananas, and chips, and drank a lot of water. Once I took off my shoes, I realized there was SAND in my shoe that had built up on the bottom of my right foot. This is what was causing the pain. There do not seem to be any blisters, but my toenails may not fare well. Right now they are ok, but my toes are sore. I am also pretty sure I have planter fasciitis in my right foot. But other than that, I FEEL AMAZING! I am not too sore, I can walk fairly well, and I am ready to do this again!!!!

Through this experience, I learned that I am capable of so much more than I would have ever imagined. Between the altitude (7000-8500ft), the heat (85-95F), and the elevation (5882 ft), this was hands down the hardest thing I have ever done but will absolutely carry me forward through future ultras. For a first ultra, I think I selected an incredibly challenging one. The race was overwhelming and emotional. I doubted my ability many times, several of the climbs made me consider dropping, the altitude kicked my butt, and the heat was intense. But I was determined to finish. Remembering my training, and the advice you have given me, I was able to work through the doubts and I found my rhythm. Because of my training, I learned how to handle the pain and challenges this trail threw at me. I knew that I was just being dramatic when I felt like quitting and that if I did, I would SO DISSAPOINTED WITH MYSELF.",1622417204

Pace: 8:35
Place: 3rd overall

Goals:
A. 8:30 avg pace (close enough on this one!)
B. Sub 5 hour finish (check!)
C. Finish (check!)

Overview:
The race went better than I could have hoped! I started off feeling incredible and kept my pace steady for the first 8-9 miles. I wasn’t going in expecting or planning to place, but when someone told me I was in third at mile 16...I had to hold it. I’m really thrilled about placing, especially since I’ve never run a race over 10 miles before and only really started running 7 months ago.

Pre-Race:
Friday night, my girlfriend, Ally, and I mapped out the aid-stations and put together food/hydration packets for hand-offs. The schedule we set up was as follows:

3 bags of roughly 200 calories of dried fruit to be handed to me at the 1/3 and 2/3 aid stations. (Same one since it was an out and back) I ate food every twenty minutes. 

Five Gu to be taken every hour. 

4 nuun tabs for the first 9 miles (though I opted instead to stick with nuun until mile 22. 

1 liter of tailwind for mile 9 onwards (switched to mile 22 as noted above)

I carried a 17oz handheld, which I topped off at every aid station.

On race day, I had a granola bar and a banana at 4:30am. I drank a redbull at 5:30.

I chose to wear a lightweight long sleeved shirt going out, as the temp was in the high 30s. At mile 9 I changed into an ultra light short sleeved shirt. This turned out to be the pro move. The weather wound up getting hotter than forecasted.

The race!

Miles 1-6 - Start to the Tunnel Aid Station

The first leg of the race went great. I was feeling a bit of soreness in my left calf, but that resolved itself after mile four.

Rather than rushing out, I tried to keep mid-pack to conserve energy. I settled into an 8:30 pace with a group of 4 other runners. We all ran together until mile 7.

Mile 4 was the road section with an unexpected 200 feet of climb. Going out this was easy...coming back not so much. 

Miles 6-9 - Tunnel to Hollywood AS

I split from the group at mile 7 and kept a comfortable pace ahead. This stretch was relatively uneventful. I made a point to eat as much of the first bag of dried fruit as I could. I made it through most of it.

Miles 9-15.5 - Hollywood to Tin Can AS

The handoff and shirt change at Hollywood went suuuuper smoothly. I was in and out in 30 seconds. Huge thanks to Ally for being super on top of crewing.

After Hollywood I let my pace get away from me a little. Logged a few 7:40-7:50 miles, which I knew would come back to bite me later. I started passing runners from the tail end of the 50 mile here.

I was still feeling great at the tail end of the this leg. Near Tin Can I passed the fourth place runner, but I wouldn’t find that out until mile 16.

Miles 15.5 - 22

At mile 16-17 (after the turn around) I ran into the group I started with, who let me know I was in 3rd place. Wasn’t expecting this, but for sure wasn’t going to let myself lose it.

Mile 19 was where I started paying for the faster miles early on. Nothing bad, but felt the fatigue and started to dial things back a little...likely not enough though. Knowing I was holding onto third...but not knowing by how much made me push harder.

I made it back to Hollywood feeling pretty good. Took about a minute breather while Ally swapped my food, loaded up the tailwind, and I shook the rocks out of my shoes.

Miles 22-25

This is where things started to fall apart a little. I dialed back to roughly a 9 minute pace coming out of Hollywood. I’d taken a pretty big swig of water and downed some cranberry juice. Stomach wasn’t handling speed well. This leveled out a little, and I was able to get some running around my goal pace, but I was fading fast.

Around here I started to get a sharp pain on the top of my left foot. Not sure what caused it, but from mile 22 to the end, every step was agony.

I was really feeling it when I hit Tunnel AS. Wasn’t terrible though.

Miles 25-31 (Tunnel AS to Finish!)

This sucked. Like really sucked. Remember that surprise elevation? That sucked. I felt okay up until the marathon (3:39!) but after that things started falling apart. The road stretch was awful and the uphills were aggravating my foot. This is when my quads decided that they were done too.

I would up hiking a few of the hills. The road stretch felt like it would never end. 

After the roads I was toast. Clocked mid to high 9s for the rest of the run. At mile 28, I met Ally along the trail and she paced me to the finish. This was a godsend cause I was pretty much ready to walk.

The last two miles were the hardest I’d run in my life. I was ready to just take a nap on the side of the trail. On the bright side though, my legs hurt so much that I barely noticed the pain in my foot.

I survived though. I held on to third place and ran it into the finish. I then walked about twenty feet before I gave up and laid down.

I’d say my first ultra went well.",1622327412

ultrarunning,Freeasabird01,Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim adventure report,"Three years ago I was just a casual runner, running about 20 miles per week. I loved trail running though and would come to learn about the trails in the Grand Canyon and wanted to run across them. I didn’t even know it was a thing people did, but I wanted to run them in one day since I don’t back backpack. I had never even run a marathon and didn’t even know what an ultra marathon was at the time. I spent about 9 months of dedicated training to run R3 in a day, but in the end it wasn’t enough. I made lots of mistakes. I pushed too hard, redlined it the whole time, didn’t control my heart rate going uphill, and didn’t have dry clothes or a jacket for the cold north rim. I made it across in one piece, but was absolutely not prepared for the return, so I took a shuttle back with my tail between my legs. 

The next year 2019 I ran my first marathon followed by three ultra marathons. In 2020 I ran over 2000 miles. With all that extra training and experience being on my legs for extended periods, I felt I was ready for another attempt. So I booked a race schedule around getting a nice buildup to culminate with another R3 attempt.

February - 6 hour trail race
March - 24 hour flat looped race (which I hoped would be my first 100 mile distance, and would be my only effort to match the expected time on feet of R3)
April - very hilly 50k
May - R3

The build up races were a disaster. The 6 hour trail race was cut short because I didn’t have spikes and the trail froze as we were running in the snow, leading to only 17 miles completed. The March race I hit a distance PR of 68 miles within the first 14 hours, but gave myself tendonitis from having my shoes tied too tight, leading to two weeks of zero running. And the 50k I went into very undertrained because of the preceding injury. All that also made my knee start giving me fits. I almost cancelled the whole thing, but my doctor gave me the green light saying I likely wouldn’t cause any permanent damage (just extended recovery). 

Here was my plan: power hike down all of South Kaibab, power hike across the mid canyon with short running bursts just to test my knee on the flat areas, and control my ascent up North Kaibab without burning out like last time. If that all went well, I would give it hell on the way back. If not, I gave myself permission to bail again due to injury. 

Starting down SK my knee was feeling good. It kind of got to 2-3 on the pain scale it had been doing before and just held there, never getting worse. Power hiking is about all I can do anyway, last time it took me 1:45 to get to the river, this time 2:05 just hiking, so not much time even lost with less damage to my legs. 

Across the mid canyon I also did well. I stuck to the plan and only ran for a few short bursts where I had a flat or slight downhill grade. The knee continued to hold up well. I did my first fluid refill at Cottonwood which is about 14 miles in. 

Once you go past Manzanita the climb becomes relentless. You climb for lengths and grades (and altitude) that we simply don’t have in the Midwest, so literally my only experience was of the prior failure in this very spot of the canyon three years prior. I think it helped at least a little to have a HRM this time which I didn’t have before. This let me find a good pace for the hr I was targeting, or at least didn’t want to exceed. Surprisingly, I still bested my slowest mile by 5m/m (45 vs 40) and summited the north rim in fantastic shape, one hour slower than prior. 

After changing socks and lubing up I was ready for the return. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind this time, I was going to finish this thing!! I checked in with my trail buddy Jay I had picked up a few miles back. We had been leap frogging for a while, only he bonked hard over the last 2 miles. He was going to come back, but needed more rest time, so I left him to catch back up later. 

1.7 miles back down I trail returned to Supai tunnel which I didn’t spend long at going up. This time I stopped for a proper rest (my first and only), lunch, and to refill my 2L bladder a second time. During my break Jay came strolling in as expected. We headed out a few minutes later and stayed together all the way back to Manzanita. Normally I really enjoy blasting the downhills. I really wanted to give them hell here and pick up some time, but I’m definitely not used to such loose gravely steep descents that give you little traction, and my knee just didn’t like grades that exceeded ~ -5% grade or so, so I had to power hike the majority of this as well.

Back at Manzanita, Jay really needed another proper stop. He had a hot spot to attend to and also needed to eat. We agreed to separate once more, with me fully expecting that he’d catch me again some number of miles later as he’d been doing for the last 10-12 miles. 

This part of the trail is where things finally start to level off a little. The average grade is typically -2-3% coming back down, which my knee was just fine with. Still, with 28+ miles on my legs, a full 15L pack, and having climbed to 8200 feet just 2 hours ago, I could only manage 15-16 minute miles, with a best mile of 13:25. But I didn’t care. I was doing this thing, and I was doing it strong. And I was still ahead of my suspected paces should I have to walk the whole thing. 

I lucked out so much with the weather. Many people who are more confident with their experience running hills and mountains might do this between November and April. The upshot it you get more moderate temps. The downside is the north rim is closed, so there’s no bail out option. You’re coming back to the south rim the way you came whether you like it or not. Anyway, the weather. I was expecting highs in the upper 80s or low 90s. A couple days earlier it had been those temps and higher. But Saturday 5/22 only got to about 80 degrees as the high at Phantom Ranch. Cruising back down to these lowest altitudes felt warm relative to the rest of the day, but it was still quite comfortable. 

I hit phantom ranch right before the dinner bell was to ring. It was about 4:30 or so and campers and lodgers were gathering for their coveted steak dinner. I refilled my water/Gatorade powder once more, tried to lube inconspicuously, put more food from my pack into my accessible pockets, and quickly headed off to finish my last 9.5 miles. 

The river trail runs alongside the Colorado for 1.7 miles before taking you to Bright Angel trail, the most famed and popular trail in the park. I’d always heard people decry the river trail, and now I know why. Every time you start gaining elevation you quickly lose it. The whole thing is sand; I managed over 35 miles without getting crap in my shoes and 50 paces in my shoe is filling with sand. And then there’s the rocks. Most of the corridor trails are well groomed, but I guess because this one doesn’t get foot traffic from the mules it doesn’t get pounded flat like the rest, so there’s lots of rock sticking up from the trail (it reminded me of the Ozark trail in Missouri). 

Once I hit Bright Angel, it was as beautiful as I could ever expect from being in the desert. Everything was lush green from spring growth. The climb wasn’t too bad. Everything was clicking. I wish I had more to report in this area, but the one thing of note wasn’t what was there, it’s what wasn’t there - Jay. I kept looking over my shoulder expecting him to come up on as he had done many other times, but he never did. The trail was also so desolate, quiet and peaceful for a good six miles or so. I went a few miles without seeing a soul - a rarity for a corridor trail in May. I guess all the rim to rimmers had finished and overnight campers were already down below. At 3 mile rest house though is when I started to run into people desperately trying to get out of the canyon before dark. I passed probably 20 people in the last 2 miles, including one getting emergency help from a ranger.

Once I got to the tunnels I knew I was finally close. The climb up BA isn’t as steep as NK, but it’s longer and it was lonelier not having anyone going my speed. And just like that, I popped out at Bright Angel Trailhead. Moving time 15:45, total time 16:45. Consumed about 4,400 calories of almost all carbs, including 8 liters of Gatorade from powder.

I found out the next day via Facebook that Jay’s foot gave him more grief and he finished an hour behind me. 

Next steps, I need to let my knee rest and heal. It’s really not that bad, but I want it back to 100%, where it was 2 months ago. https://imgur.com/a/RTZx9cZ/",1622138680

ultrarunning,Big_air_az,Opinions on Long sleeve shirts for ultras in hot weather?,"My background before ultras was a lot of long distance hiking where the standard shirt is typically some sort of button down or light weight sun protecting long sleeve shirt. For example, the Columbia PFG series.  

This has typically been what I wear in ultras as well just because I don't like getting sunburnt and I'm comfortable in them and used to them..  I've got a 50k coming up near Phoenix az with pretty high heat forecasted, 94 degrees.  While this isn't all that crazy hot, I live in Flagstaff AZ which is much colder and I don't have much heat acclimation. 

My question for you all is what is your opinion on long sleeve shirts for running in hot weather?  Traditional knowledge seems to be wear as little as possible, but there's also some trends of long sleeve lightweight stuff catching on like those ultralight hoodie's.

I recently took a pair of running shorts and converted them to skirt. It was a little long for running, but overall worked well. Only issue I had was the length. Once it got wet from sweat it got a little annoying, bit long shorts do the same. 

I did a 20 mile run with no other issues. I did wear compression shorts under, but still felt cooler and had less fabric bunching.

Sometimes even with the right socks and shoes, ya just get em! 

I will use chauff cream sometimes on longer runs in potential hot spots, but again this stuff is expensive. I prefer tape / pads on potential hots spots as prevention vs the chauff cream because my feet feel slippery in my shoes after.

ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,First steps- Mountain 40k in October- does my training plan look ok?,"Not an ultra, sorry if that is not allowed. Building up to ultras. Here in Spain 50k seems to be a less popular distance- the mountain running circuit seems mostly to have events in the 40ish, 60ish, 80ish then 100+ range.

**The race**: 42km approx. with 1800m+ vert, October 16, In El Escorial, NW of Madrid, Mostly on mountain trails, dirt roads.

**Me**: 45M, currently doing 50-60km/week usually, with long runs of up to 32k/20miles, almost all on trails/dirt roads. Mostly hilly runs with frequent mountain outings of 500m+ at weekends.

**Factors to consider**: The heat of summer- sometimes up to 40C (104F) where I live, and very hot weather can last weeks at a time. Not humid. 

**Vague Plan**: because of the heat, a bit of periodization. JUNE, take advantage of long, still relatively cool evenings to work on building speed with one day hill intervals, one day flat intervals. JULY, spend some  time focusing on heat adaptation in order to be able to maintain volume and fitness. Use the fact that running in heat and direct sun is hard to build resilience; AUGUST take some time off work and go hunting vert in the mountains. Do reccy of some of the race route. SEPTEMBER max training load- build to 8+ per week, do reccy of rest of race route, at least one 5hr+ run to test nutrition, hydration, gear, chafing strategies. OCTOBER taper down to the 16th

ultrarunning,HaskersMaskers,Is a 50mi Too Ambitious For My Running Background?,"First off, I'm a long time lurker in this community as I have wanted to dip my toe into ultras for the past year or so and keep coming up with excuses as to why I can't. Looking for some advice from much more experiences folks in this community.

# Background

24M. Former college football player and still a much larger than average runner (6'5"", 215lbs). Started running in 2018 to lose weight, ran my first/only marathon in 2019 (4:09), and was planning on running two more in 2020 but, ya know, \*gestures at everything\*

Cumulative miles in 2019, 2020, 2021 are 888, 1614, 780. Average mileage per week so far in 2021 is 40. I'm currently on week six of a slightly modified Pfitz 18/55, so have had mileage of 46, 42, 45, 49, 52, 50 the past six weeks. Taking a cut-back week this week down to \~35 but in general I feel really good. Long Runs are in the 16-18 range right now. I didn't have a race on the calendar when I started this block and was just going to see where it could take me. I set a goal of 3:30 for training paces and so far, it feels like that's about where my fitness is. Long Runs with MP miles within feel tough but I'm not destroying myself to hit the paces. 

# 50k/50mi

Leading to my main question, I'm itching to get back to racing and in specific, ultras. The 50k I am eyeing is on July 3rd about 10mi from my house. It's in a state park that I'm very familiar with but has a relatively hard profile (1423m). It was one that I was training for last spring so I know the climbs and how much is runnable but I haven't been putting in any trail specific work this year.  I'm also thinking about a 50mi (Stewart Tunnel) that is run in Southern WI on August 1st. It has an easier profile (744m) and a generous cutoff (12hrs). My initial plan was to modify the 18/55 plan to incorporate some long runs on the trails and back-to-backs. I would toss most of the MP specific work out the window and do a LT workout during the week with back-to-back LRs on the weekend. I've been practicing fueling but plan to use those LRs as a time to completely dial that in.

My question is: With only 9 weeks to the 50mi race, will I have enough training base to complete the race? Is 15 weeks, peaking around 60-65, enough for my first 50mi? Would it make sense to run the 50k as my last ""workout"" in 6 weeks and then taper?  Like I said, I feel like I'm overthinking and making excuses as to why I can't. I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm either biting off more than I can chew or to just do the damn thing and write a race report afterwards.",1621477812

ultrarunning,YungBeard,Early warning signs of bonking,"After a couple of years, I’m still terribly inconsistent with my stomach and nutrition on race days.  I’m pretty sure it’s because I let my guard down at aid stations and wind up eating and drinking less than I think I am.  Usually, by the time I realized I’m in a caloric hole, it’s too late to turn things around and I wind up puking before toughing things out for the rest of the day.  It tends to be really subtle until it hits me like a brick and my stomach is turning over itself, making eating that much harder or impossible before I yack.  I have a plan to help keep on top of this moving forward (including being a lot more intentional with what I eat and the portion size on a more regular schedule), but I’m wondering if anyone has noticed any early warning signs that tell them they need to start eating again before disaster strikes.

I'm a little on the larger side by ultra runner standards, and I sorta have a big booty. All that tissue was wiggling and jiggling my glute max, and glute min and piriformis seemed super sore, too. Every downhill step was agony as the force traveled up that sore tissue. I thought, ""Well good. I know I'm using my glutes on the uphills, at least."" But my quads were crazy sore, too, specifically, the vastus lateralis, and that took almost a week to work out completely with a roller and lacrosse ball. I have a 100 I'm training for at the end of July that this 50 was in preparation for. I do one strength workout a week at the gym with weighted squats/lunges, some kickboxing type exercises, and jump squats/lunges.

Race report 24 Hour Run for a Cure:

Bit of a long read sorry.

Background info:

Age: 17

Gender: M

Furthest previous run: 32km in 3 hours

Course was 850m laps of the school fields

Goals: 

1. Finish 24 hours 

2. Complete 100 Km

3. Raise $2000 NZD for cancer support/research

Hours 1-6

Started out at 8.30am with a frost still on the ground. Feet were soaked pretty much straight away, which lead to some rubbing on the inside of my right foot. I band aided up, applied some glide and kept running, as soon as the ground was dry, I changed socks and re did my plasters. Rubbing stopped shortly after and I had no blisters to show but kept the plasters on to be safe. Moved well as was expected, stopping every few Km to grab some apple/orange slices and hydration. Went through the first Marathon in 4.30 and had finished 52 Km at hour 6. I was moving wayyy too fast but some stern words from my coach helped me to focus on the big picture and slow way down. This definitely affected me later, but also meant I had some decent Kms under my belt early.

Hours 7-12

Still jogging most laps with set walking intervals to start with, and everything kept going smoothly till about hour 8.5 when I started getting sharp pains in the top of my right foot. We tried a shoe change, sock change, relaxation techniques and different strapping techniques but not much was helping the pain and it was looking pretty bleak. The sun set and temps dropped right as it was getting really bad which lead to some really slow walked Kms. Luckily at Hour 10ish  we ordered pizzas which was a massive mood boost, and a bunch of students from the dorms came out to run a few laps with me. Shortly after this one of my teachers/ coach tried a new strapping technique which together with a slightly altered running style, reduced foot pain greatly. Stumbled through 82.6km at 12 hours.

Hours 13-18

6 of my running buddies and good friends from school showed up with some tunes and positivity, past half way so my mentality was improving and my foot was feeling better, back to mostly jogging laps with set walking intervals. When they left, they were replaced by teachers and dorm students that had snuck out of bed, cloud cover came in which lifted temperature and hence the mood. One teacher brought a brazier down which was massive. These hours weren’t very fast but time past quickly and the spirits were high. Food and water was going down well, no blisters to speak of, minimal chaffing and not too much pain. At 1am it started to rain lightly which scared us at first but it held off and only rained very lightly for the next few hours, not enough to cause chaffing or make us cold. 16 hours through I had finished 100km which was incredible feeling, and a massive mood boost. Ticked over 109.4km at the 18 hour mark.

Hours 19-24

Slow slow slow. Lots of walking through these laps. People had started leaving at hour 18 so there was only me and a couple of others for a little while, this was tough on my mind but luckily my swim coach and elite ultra-runner showed up with her dog and some excellent advice and chatter. At 3am people started coming for the morning and this kept me going, though still very slowly. A couple hours before dawn I hit another low point as my foot pain returned and I still had 4 hours to go. Lots of supported acted as if I was already done despite a lot of pain and Kms still to go. Could hardly stand for a while there and was emotionally wrecked at the thought of not finishing after doing so much. Kept moving slowly and held out for dawn, after which my pain started reducing. Walked pretty much all the last 6 hours, but minimized stops between laps. Managed to jog for the last lap before I finished with 132.1 Km. Poured with rain as soon as I finished but I didn’t care. Drove the 2 mins home and managed to stay awake long enough to shower and pass out.

Ending thoughts

Super happy with how it went overall. Feel a bit like better pace management at the start could have let me run further, but for a first ultra, let alone 24hrs I am super proud of how it went. Even better is the fact that I raised over $3000 for my charity, which is way more than my goal, and I smashed my 100km goal for the run.

ultrarunning,sneakersinparis,How much is too much?,"What’s up friends!

So I’ve been running for almost two years now, and just finished my first 100k on April 10th of this year. I ran a 50 miler last October, and have also run two marathons and two 50k races since I started running (late summer 2019). 

My current schedule for the summer is as follows:

Squaw Peak 50 miler, June 12
Pike Peak 50 miler, July 31
Run Rabbit Run 100 miler, Sept 17

My question for you all is this: am I doing too much, too soon? I’ve always been athletic (25 year old male), and so far the distance running has come easily and happily to me. I’ve had no problem successfully following training plans like the ones found in Relentless Forward Progress, and have found joy in completing every challenge I’ve so far tackled. That being said, Run Rabbit Run is my priority by far, and an injury that affected my ability to finish there would really be a tough hit. 

So, should I stick with what I’ve got, or should I cut out Squaw Peak? Thank you all for your advice!!",1620938994
ultrarunning,Drymps,My first ultra...,"Hey everyone, I have my first ultra marathon this weekend which is a 60km road run. I am concerned about the cut off time which is 6 hours 30. 4 weeks ago I ran a marathon in 4 hours with 600m elevation. This weekend it's 1000m elevation (2 x 500m elevation hills at the 35km and 50km mark) and I will be running into a 30kmph headwind the whole way as it's a point to point. I have been averaging 60km of total weekly milage for the past 3 weeks. What would be a good pacing strategy? Do you think I am prepared enough to make the cut off time? Is the wind going to make or break my day ? Should I run harder at the start and walk up the hills? Or run at a zone 2 pace at the start and run walk the hills? Am I over cooking the pre race thoughts and that's normal ? Any advice would be hugely appreciated!",1620938745

I've been desperately looking for a bigger pack for overnights runs, and considering their price I've been hesitating a lot.
So I currently have a salomon adv skin 12 and I absolutely love it. However, I'm planning a 3days in the Alps this summer, so I will probably need a bigger pack.
 I've been looking at the UD fastpack 25 or 30, the raidlight 24, the omm classic 25. I'd go for a salomon if they had a bigger one because I know it fits me but can't seem to find any above 12L. 
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had insights into those packs (or other?), knowing I'm a quite small women and I'd like a pack that doesn't bounce around to much. I'm also not sure if I should go for something on the bigger side as I would also like to do a few trips in Scotland, where the weather requires more kit.

In past ultras I'm a front of the middle of the pack runner and typically can accurately guess my pace/ time based on past results but for a couple of reasons I don't feel confident in this strategy.  

1. This race is at elevation and I live at sea level
2. The race is 80% male (I'm female) so im assuming this will significantly shift the results faster? I considered basing my plan on just womens results but in an average year only about 10 women finish the race so its a small sample 


Obviously I'm planning to start slow but im worried about not having the right stuff in the right drop bags at the right times (not taking pacers or crew) and this throwing off my mental strategy.  Am I over thinking this? My goal is just to finish strong",1620754225

This past weekend, I was scrambling to meet the cutoff times at the aide stations. Since I started, I've had the mentality, ""walk the uphill sections; run the flats and downhills."" And that was barely enough to meet the cutoff times and fuel myself properly on Saturday. I followed a training plan pretty rigidly since January, and I still feel so mediocre. This course was definitely for better, faster runners, and I'm getting kind of tired of always hustling to meet cutoffs and being stressed about DNF-ing.

My wife and young kids would be pretty unhappy if I blew an entire Saturday running and recovering.

ultrarunning,Runderpants37,Race Report- Dirty German 50k,"Race: 
Dirty German 50K Trail Race in Pennypack Park, Philadelphia
Date: 
May 8th, 2021

Conditions: 
Very Cool, Trails were wet and an absolute mudfest. Several stream crossings, mostly singletrack, several miles of crushed stone/paved bike path along the way. 

Preparation: 
I felt really good heading into my first ultramarathon. My training had hit most of the benchmarks I was hoping for. I kept my mileage fairly low- peaking at little over 50 miles a week (almost all trails) and only running 5 days a week to prevent injury. I put in at least 5 long runs of 20+ miles including  a trail marathon 5 weeks prior. Had a good nutrition plan, good taper, good rest. Felt confident. 

Race Day: 
The conditions were much wetter than I expected. Philadelphia had gotten hit with a lot more rain than Delaware the last few days. There would be no dry shoes at any point in the race and the depth of mud/slippage deeply impacted footing, pacing and effort. 

I was fine with letting the leaders get away early on, and settled into a comfortable pace for the first few miles. But after the 2nd mile directly behind two guys, I realized that I was following them too closely, and I wasn't running my own pace. So I sidestepped them and picked things up. Shortly after, a guy passed me (I called him Beardo) and at 4 miles I was tempted to go with him... but this time realized that it was too early and again I needed to run my race, so I let him go. My body felt really great. I was light on my feet and easily able to hop over the deepest mud puddles and jump over logs across the trail (note: this may have been a contributing factor to what happened later).  Felt like it made sense to not have my feet more saturated than absolutely necessary. 

I hit my nutrition goals for the first 10 miles and I was right on my goal pace. As early as 13 miles in, people were already coming back to me and I wasn't pushing. I moved from 8th overall to 7th, and then 6th as we hit the halfway point and started on the second loop. Around mile 14, though, I noticed something strange. A couple of times that I stepped up over a log, I felt my right hamstring begin to tighten, nearly seizing up. I wondered if I had gotten dehydrated already or was low on sodium. I tried to stomach some bacon and potato chips at my next Aid station but I hardly got any in. I walked through the aid station and stretched out my leg lightly. I had no idea what was in store.

Still feeling pretty good, around 16 miles I caught back up to Beardo and moved into 5th place. Again, I was feeling fine in every way but my hamstring, fully knowing that there was a lot more racing to do.  The miles passed and I held my steady pace, but I was so aware of every time I had to bend my legs extra- going up hills, hopping on a rock or log, and had to be extra careful. 
A few miles later my first big seize up happened. It was around the 21 mile mark. I attempted to jump over a low log, only 8 inches off the ground, and my hamstring locked. I stumbled to the side and yelled, trying to pry my leg back straight and get rid of the cramp. It felt like a baseball formed on the back of my leg under the skin. I've dealt with a little cramping here and there, but nothing like this. At the Aid station at mile 23, my family met me. I needed a short break, so I decided to change out my muddy socks and massage my hamstring a little, hoping that this thing would go away. I stopped for a little less than 2 minutes and took off again. My confidence was fading, but it was clear that I couldn't catch the runners in front of me who were way out there, so my real task was just to hold my position. And I had a big gap over 6th place.  I had held an 8:24 pace through the first 22 miles through thick mud, which was right on track for me. But that was when the cramping really hit. 

The last 8 miles were a serious sufferfest.  Both hamstrings began to seize regularly. 6 times in the last 8 miles one of my hamstrings locked up completely, sending my shrieking and crashing onto the ground on the side of the trail, rolling on my side and trying to get my leg to straighten back. But when I straightened it out, my quad would lock up. So each time I tried rolling around into a position where the seizing would stop, then carefully find a way to stand back on my feet without letting it lock again, then walk it out, and then gently try to jog again without lifting my leg too high, or it would start all over. So I'd run for a few minutes at a shuffle, then scream, fall over again, then crawl, walk, and get running again. 
This is where the ultra community showed how awesome it is. An older woman doing the 50 miler stopped and gave me salt tabs. Another woman offered me a gel. A guy helped me get up and then did a 20 second fist pound massage on my hamstring. Another guy shot water into my mouth from his hydration pack, since I had dropped mine off earlier (since stations were only 3-4 miles apart). I would get a few minutes of respite, then everything would lock again. But people were SO encouraging. This is where it was a real gift to have the 25k runners and the 50milers on the course at the same time, because otherwise I would have been out there mostly alone. It was also very humbling to appear so pitiful to everyone who ran past. 
At this point, all these guys that I had developed a mile lead on began catching up, as my pace of jogging, falling, stretching, and walking worked out to 11-12 minute miles.  I realized my top 5 hope was out of reach, so the goal became to finish my first ultra. There were times in the last two miles that I was yelling at my leg on every step- ""DON'T DO IT! DON'T YOU LOCK UP AGAIN!"" I'm sure I was a real joy to be around at that point. 

It was a fascinating experience, because every time the legs relaxed, I would run past a bunch of people, then they'd pass me again when I lay in the ditch down the trail. They'd say things like, ""man I'm so sorry, hang in there."" And then I would awkwardly pass them again 5 minutes later, only to repeat all over again. 
But when I heard the sound of the accordion player at the finish line, I knew I would finish. My second half of the race was over 25+ minutes slower, which is not normal at all for an even paced runner like I tend to be. But I crossed the line, and the first half of my race proved enough to allow me still hobble into a 10th place overall finish and second in my age group- which means I get a coveted German Weather House award!
I'm still not sure the root of my cramping. Weak hamstrings? Low sodium? Seems strange for salt to be an issue for a cool day of low sweat, where I felt like I was taking in a lot of electrolytes. Simply fatigue? I wonder if jumping over all those logs and leaping around mud puddles early on put a strain on my hamstrings that I didn't realize until later.  Or maybe the mud and slick footing made my muscles work much harder than my other marathon distance runs? I really want to figure that out. I've never cramped in a race before, marathon or otherwise. 
Despite the amount of pain, it was a great first experience and left me ready for more. I didn't hit my stretch goals of top 5 and sub 4:30 on this course, but I hit my base goals of finishing, making top 10, and placing in my age group. The ultra community is supportive, fun, and compassionate, and the race was wonderfully organized, despite all the unavoidable mud.  My family was incredible in their crewing  and encouragement. Can't wait to get back at it in the future.  For now, it's time to recover.",1620587711
ultrarunning,infp_futurepsych,“Pumped” calves that won’t go away?,"I transitioned from Brooks Cascadias to Altras in November and have been running an average of 25-30mi/week with no issues. I’ve been happy in the altras and love the space and cushion. However, about a month ago, my calves began getting super tight particularly on uphills (I do a good bit of climbing/mountain running) and they’ve only continued to get worse. The tightness definitely correlated with increasing vert, and some speed increase now that trails are melted out, and I’ve been mountain biking a little. So... definitely an up in training load which makes sense, but I’ve been running in the Altras for months without issue so I don’t think it’s poor transitioning (as it is for many). Perhaps I upped my training too much too quick, but it didn’t feel that way to me... Foam rolling and some PT has helped but I’m worried because summer is here and I have some ultras coming up and want to be able to keep increasing mileage and vert but am really limited now. My calves tighten up so much and feel pumped like your forearms when you climb a lot, if there are any climbers out here who know the feeling. It’s awful, and if I don’t stay on too of rest and rolling and PT, it ends up pulling through my Achilles and heel, which is super concerning. 

My PT said she didn’t think the shoes were a problem and instead we’re working on ankle flexion and strength to make sure I’m not just relying on my calves more than I should. But my friend who was in Altras for a bit said she had the same issue and once she swapped to Hoka Speedgoats it went away. I tried them on and liked the feel, and I like that they’re still a relatively low drop. I guess I’m caught up in the zero drop hype but I do like my Altras, and I think they’ve helped my form, but if I can’t run at all then they definitely aren’t worth it. Ha! 

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this in the Altras and if so what you did about it. I am super happy to change shoes again (to the Hokas probably) but also don’t wanna go chasing false solutions if my issue really is just form or something PT can fix.",1620586162

### Beforehand
A month-ish earlier, some previously stable part of my brain decided to go on hiatus and I spontaneously signed up for my first 50K running race, this one conveniently local to my hometown of Syracuse. That first taste of ultramarathoning went swimmingly in most regards; I covered three hilly park loops in just under four hours, with the only caveat coming from a navigation fuckup that left me without an official finish. Ah well.

So, back to the race registration search, looking anywhere within drive-and-one-night-in-a-hotel distance for another 50K in May or June. All of the big and “good” events were long since full; a couple little oddballs around the area had space, and I settle on the Greater Long Island Running Club’s (GLIRC) Greenbelt race. The elevation total (~3500 feet) looks the same as what I did in April; it’s Long Island, that can’t be that hard, right? Lots of previous years’ winners came through in 4:20s, 4:30s -- holy shit, can I win this thing?

I’ve got plenty of training distance in my legs, hitting 1100 miles for 2021 just before heading over to Long Island. What I don’t have, though, is a particular focus on elevation or trail running. I’ve been running from my home and around the roads on various loops -- in a flat neighborhood that’s part of a fairly flat city. In the week-ish between registering and racing, I push myself out a bit to get some more short stretches of singletrack, and even add in a day of hill repeats (three of them!). It’s obviously far too late to have any physical benefit, but I tell myself I’ll at least be a little more mentally comfortable on race day.

### Getting There
I ask the group chat of teachers in my preschool classroom if anyone else has already put in a time off request for the Friday before the race. Uh, yes, someone does; there goes my morning departure. We do have our awesome occupational therapist coming in to lead an afternoon activity, though, so I at least get to duck out at noon to start my six-ish hour schlep. That, of course, puts me on the inbound George Washington Bridge right at 5:00… and 5:10… and 5:20…

I make it to the start point in Plainview, switch from teacher pants into running shorts in a portapotty, and head off on the course with a mix of light jogging the driving malaise out of my legs and also walking/googling nearby pizza places. The ~1.5 miles of trail that I see are smooth dirt, rolling a bit, narrow -- still not my comfort zone of “sidewalk” but definitely doable! Back to the car, pizza acquired, into the hotel with a broken TV and choppy wifi to flop around for a few hours and prep my race day gear.

### Morning Of
I’m awake right before my 5:30 alarm for the 7:30 start. On the Monday prior, I’d tried to shift my schedule into morning running to be better prepared for Saturday’s race; that failed instantly with a flurry of snooze buttons. So, yeah, time for the earliest run start I’ve had in the last ~1.5 years. It’s an average cloudy morning, perfect for split shorts and short sleeves with some arm warmers I plan to ditch halfway through the race. I check out the various other entrants, recognizing one dude as Jesse, the 2018 winner from race photos, and wonder who else might be up with me trying to finish closer to four hours than to five (or six or seven or eight).

### Leg 1
The out-and-back itself is slightly under 7.5 miles, so our day begins with a bonus paved stretch to hit the full 50K. Sure enough, Jesse is off the front at the start; I’m behind him by 40ish feet and checking my watch as we hit mile one in sub-7. Oops. I’m annoyed by the overexcited start, but I’ve done hundreds of road miles at that pace and am not particularly worried about feeling ill effects from it later on.

We lose the pavement and hit the trails just after mile two, covering the same stuff I’d briefly checked out the night before. Right at mile three is one of the course’s several uncontrolled road crossings; I catch up to Jesse who’s stopped and waiting for a gap in traffic, and Ihor, who’d been a minute or so behind me on pavement, joins us as well.

We eventually make it through that stupid intersection (for the first of four times on the day) and move through the easiest unpaved part of the course with fresh legs in 7:30 and 8:00 miles. One of our trio peels just off-course for a pee break; I wind up leading by a short distance but never out of eyesight, thankfully, because turns out I desperately needed a veteran/local Long Island runner to keep my tourist ass somewhere close to following the course.

And then there’s Cold Springs Harbor. The handful of random race recaps I’d read mention the northernmost ~2 miles of the course as the toughest section by far; nothing ungainly in terms of grade or elevation, but plenty of roots and rocks and primitive stairs. My last-minute smooth singletrack practice… not as relevant here. I shuffle and walk a bit, Ihor blazes past me on one (literally, for him) screaming descent that I take much more cautiously, but I regain my position from him going up a hill and am again in first place at the turn-around aid station.

### Leg 2
Just like in my April 50K, I’m running essentially gear-less. I’d dug up ym old water bottle handheld and even tried it out a bit in the week prior before realized I’d rather take a ten second walk through the course’s plentiful aid stations as needed rather than carry that dumb thing for four plus hours. Anyway, I take a bit longer than usual at the turn-around for multiple cups of Gatorade, then take back off up the hill right as Ihor is getting in.

I’m slow and safe through the roots and rocks again, getting to the third-of-the-way point in around 1:25 -- technically right on pace for a 4:15 finish, though there won’t be any more sub-7 paved miles to help with the cause so in reality I know I'll be closer to 4:30. My focus starts to shift from time to position; how far ahead of Ihor did I leave the turnaround? Jesse is coming the other way not long after my departure. Sure as shit it’s looking like a three-person race.

I make it out of Cold Springs and settle back into 8:00-ish running through the more reasonable trail sections. I’m feeling good about making it through one of my two passes of the roots and rocks bullshit… when I trip over an Invisible Protruding Nothing and fall onto my knee and palm. Ah, shit. I pull myself back up, see a bit of blood starting to form on my knee but overall looks about as harmless as possible. On we go.

25K racers started an hour after the 50K, and they’re starting to show up on the course now, and of course I’m also going past the other folks in the 50. I’m pretty stoked to have them there for two reasons -- first as a couple of dozen people to cheer at me and tell me that I’m in first, and second as extra things to look for to make sure that I’m on the course now that I’m (at least for now) out of sight of Ihor and his superior navigation skills.

I make it to the southern turnaround at mile 16, grabbing my stash of Clif Bloks and a dry hat from my drop bag, leaving behind my soaked-with-sweat arm warmers. I try to gauge just how far I go back north before seeing the other runners; it’s about a third of a mile for Ihor and close to a full mile for Jesse.

### Leg 3
… in which I continue to think a lot more about just what I need to do to win the race and less about pace or time.

For now, I’m still moving decently through the rolling forested miles after the turnaround, more 8:00-ish miles as I reapproach the (ugh) start of Cold Springs Harbor. I tell myself that pushing myself to save two or three or five minutes through this stretch isn’t going to help me win, but overdoing it and breaking some number of bones in some part of my body after a slip can absolutely make me lose. So, the 9-10-10 mile splits I got on the hills of my first pass through this section become 11-12-10. So it goes.

At the turnaround I chug a third and fourth cup of Gatorade and force some a horrendous Gu packet down my gullet. I grab another Gu before heading out, though honestly if I needed some desperate electrolytes in the last hour I might’ve licked the sweat off my arms before opening up that thing. And back south we go.

### Leg 4
Ihor shows up coming the other way, maybe half a mile up the trail, but it’s a damn tough half mile and I figure he’ll also need a minute or three at the aid station. Twelve, fifteen minutes ahead? I’ll take that. Beyond the Cold Springs terrain, I start to apply that to how I’m running the “easy” trails for the last 10K to the finish. 8ish pace on flats becomes 9ish. Short and steeper rollers become tiny walking breaks. I tell myself I’m not going to lose my fairly safe lead with a one-hour final 10K, but I absolutely will lose it if I bonk or break something. (Somehow that conservative approach still doesn’t convince me to eat the stupid final Gu packet, though).

And… it all works the way I hoped it would. I keep plodding through mile 28, 29, 30, getting back onto some glorious pavement for the half mile to the finish. And then they even have an actual, honest-to-god finish line ribbon waiting for me. Well, more like a finish line vinyl banner. 4:34:12. Book it. I’ll take that voucher good for a pair of Salomon shoes and a gaudy plaque, please.

### Aftermath
I gather a bunch of congratulations and fist-bumps and attaboys from GLIRC people and 25K finishers and graze through their well-stocked snack options -- a 10 foot party sub here, some chips and cookies there, a bunch of water, two cans of Sprite, pizzas show up a bit later… good, good shit. Ihor, sure and steady enough, arrives second, somewhere in the 4:50s.

I still might try to squeeze in another East Coast 50K before my wife and I move out of the area this summer. I turned in my first place shoe certificate for a pair of Salomon trail shoes -- maybe it’s time to explore whether basically every single other runner in this GLIRC event had the right idea about footwear and I’m being the weirdo for wearing lightweight road shoes on trail ultras. On the other hand, I did win the damn thing, so…

But that’s future stuff. After a few more rounds of the snack tables, I reluctantly and gingerly re-loaded my car and headed back to Syracuse. Traffic was mercifully light going west through the city on a Saturday afternoon -- I think I’d used up all my foot and ankle muscles on those goddam roots and rocks and was not really on board for another half hour of working the clutch pedal through stop-and-go bridge traffic.

ultrarunning,AHRocks187,How do you deal with failure/disappointment?,"Hey everyone,

This morning I was meant to be trying to set an unsupported FKT on a 38 mile trail near my family home. But anyone in the South of the UK this morning will have experienced the strong wind and rain, and when I got towards the start point I realised that it was very foggy as well. Unfortunately I'd not been able to recce the first half of the course due to covid, and so the combination of weathers meant it felt silly to put myself in a potentially dangerous situation in an unknown area unsupported. After all, I have my first 100 in 5 weeks time so don't need to be getting injured!

Despite knowing it was probably the right choice, mentally I'm feeling crushed. Part of me feels it was weak to drop out, as if it was a race then I would have gone and started - but also if it was a race I'd have had support, route markings and other runners to buddy with. Doesn't help that I'm reading a book currently on fell running where that sort of weather must be standard!

ultrarunning,SmartestAnt,Power Hiking Form and Intensity,"Prepping for a mountain race in a few months, I have noticed a few things. On the incline trainer/treadmill, I am able to maintain zone 2 intensity at a steady walking pace up to about 15-20% incline. I take relatively normal steps/strides and feel no desire to put my hands on top of my thighs. 

Outdoors on real trails, on climbs of any significant grade, I am inclined to take much larger steps (power hiking), which immediately spikes my HR into zone 3/4 and requires me to put my hands on my thighs. The intensity is not sustainable for an all-day effort. If I take smaller steps, my HR falls slightly but I feel very inefficient.

What is the move here? Is this just revealing my poor aerobic base? Should I accept that the intensity will drift into zone 3 on climbs? My race starts with 2600 vertical feet in the first 3 miles (climbing to ridgeline). Going full blast for the first hour seems like the wrong answer.",1620402604

ultrarunning,bluedolphin87,Why are there no self supported ultramarathon races?,"I spent a few days at Cocodona last weekend and while the race was absolutely incredible, I found the cost of entry quite deterring. It got me thinking about some of the ultra-distance races in cycling, like the Tour Divide, or GB Duro, where there is technically a race happening, but really it's just people racing from one location to the other with no support. We have FKT's in ultrarunning, but I've never heard of a large group of people racing the PCT, for example, or some other long trail in self supported fashion. Am I the only one that thinks such an endeavour would be awesome? 

Furthermore, I wonder what the legal implications are? As long as there are no crews and aid stations, can you even legally organise an event that involves people going through wilderness areas? Even if it's just like 15 people who were invited via Facebook? You can backpack with a group of friends, so at what point is it not allowed? 

Either way, I think this should be a thing in ultra running. Just a group of people trying to finish a 200+ mile trail as fast as possible in self supported style, no crew and no aid stations.

ultrarunning,Realmless,Sustained Uphill Running,"I’m wondering if anyone has tips on how to train for sustained gradual uphills. The area I’m looking for guidance is the long, drawn-out, pseudo-hills where it’s not quite steep enough to require walking, but it’s got too much of an incline to run without expending precious energy. 

I’ve got a 100-mile race in August that has what seems to be two forever climbs that I think I’m drastically underestimating. I’m good with huge elevation gains, but I seem to struggle with prolonged gradual climbs. The first climb is almost 25 miles long and is only \~4200 feet of elevation. But each mile gradually climbs between 100-250 feet/mile for a net uphill effect that is relentless. The second climb is about 30 miles of the same, 100-250 feet/mile elevation change. These occasionally have breaks but for the most part they are dauntingly consistent. I’m wondering if there is a technique to improve upon this skill? My normal plan is to speed-hike the uphills and run the flats and downhills, but that would mean too much walking. I just completed a 50 miler with a six-mile stretch like this towards the end of the race and it basically was soul-sucking. I was able to do it, but it wasn't pretty. I am planning to get out on the course to see what it's really like, but I’m looking for ways to improve my incline running.

I just ran a half marathon with a pace of about 12:30/mile at a moderate-hard effort for me — I've been utilizing a run/walk for training and continued it for the race. I've been training on roads this season, but previous trail runs I've done have easily put me in the 15-20+ minute/mile range even with relatively mellow elevation gain. 

I have three months to train on trails, practice power hiking, downhills, and time on feet—but I'm freaking out that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of making the cutoff for the 50k I signed up for, the Wy'East Howl, which has 6,000 feet of gain and 5,000 feet of descent with two cutoffs - 6.5 hours to reach the 20.7 mile marker, 10 hours for the total race.

(Re: athletic background—I backpacked 1,000 miles in a summer a few years ago, but mileage was usually ~15-20 and I had the security of taking as long as I wanted. Current easy running pace is like 13:30/mile on roads.)

- His homepage: http://worldrun.org/m_introduction.php

 


I don't know much else about him. His Youtube-channel has only been active for about a month, but I watched his videos (IN DANISH!) on training, and he talks about:

- Long term planning: How to ramp up volume over the years from being a casual runner (less than 50K per week) to being an enthusiastic casual runner/casual ultrarunner (100 K per week), maybe even to international level athlete (140K per week in the off season).  
- Shorter term planning: Ramping up/down volume during the year, when to peak and rest and the importance of recovering for 3 months a year at (for example) half volume  
- Long distance training runs
- Tempo runs for ultrarunners: From classical tempo runs (1 min on/off) over medium/long intervals (1-5K) to very long tempo runs (20 to 65K)
- Injury prevention and early signs of fatigue, including persisting mood changes to more concrete physical signs of fatigue to chronic injury, with the main point being: Injuries do not usually appear because of a single run/session. They appear because you ignored signs or didn't realise early enough.
- Mental strength and fueling during runs (while the concepts are universally applicaple, I'm not personally convinced the specific content in these videos is as high quality as the training videos).

The training videos are probably only useful for other scandinavians (unless someone chooses to create subtitles for them), but his videos about the world runs are in english, and to me it seems like he want's to tell his stories, so more videos are probably coming.",1620040387

I posted this in the running subreddit but they deleted it, unfortunately. I'm just going to copy and paste it here if that's okay?

Yesterday, 4/29/21, I ran 13.4 miles while on acid. I want to write about it because honestly, I've never experienced anything like I did yesterday and it was such an amazing experience. I've done acid a lot over the past few years, but almost every time I did it it was in a party environment or on my own in a bedroom. I love running, like a lot. Like when I think of myself as a person the first thing that pops up in my head to describe myself to others is that I'm a runner. Not a very good runner, but a runner who loves to run.

I really had no goals in mind with this run other than to be as careful as I could and to just enjoy myself. To enjoy my feet below me carrying me wherever I will them too. I didn't have a time limit I barely took any precautions. I had never done anything like this before. It was all very spur of the moment and I hardly did any planning or preparing whatsoever.

I got up for work at 3:15 am and got home from work around 6:40 pm. I knew that I was going to be tired and that I'd need to take the acid as soon as I got home so that I could still be running when the acid finally hit me. I started my run just after 7 pm Thursday afternoon.

Miles 1-3 They felt very similar to the beginning of every run. I wasn't tripping yet so I mostly focused on stretching my legs out and keeping a slow and easy pace. I followed the train tracks out of my small rural town that I live in and just kept running beside them for miles. Until the closest road was over 3 miles away and I was just in farmland.

Mile 4 About an hour or so after I took the acid. I could feel it coming on now and just felt incredibly light, happy, and proud. I was proud that I was running. I was proud that I worked an entire day and still decided to run a half marathon. I was proud of this crazy little trip I decided to take.

Mile 5-6 This is my favorite part of my run. I was surrounded by nature. River, swamp, farmland, open sky. For a brief moment, it all felt like mine. It felt right. I didn't want to leave but the sun was going down and I needed to make it home because I left my headlamp at home because I was in such a rush to start my run. Before I reached my halfway point I saw a white tail deer running like 25-30 yards to my north and ran with her for a while. I tried to get a picture of her or a video but I couldn't because I am stupid lol. Snapchat video of my favorite part

Mile 7-8 I was tripping. I ran along the train tracks and was mesmerized by the long golden grains of grass following the breeze in the wind. They all looked the same to me. Every piece standing tall and proud reaching towards the sky and the breeze from the south and east blowing them in the same direction of my home. I followed the dancing grass. I watched the birds take off on flight in front of me. I watched them jet off into the sky and effortlessly carry themselves on the wind. I felt very similar to them. Their wings are to them and the sky as my legs are to me and the ground.

Miles 9-11 The train tracks brought me up alongside small bodies of water and it was really, really hard to focus on my running because each wave and ripple on the water just grabbed my attention. Demanded that I look at it and appreciate the beauty I found myself alone and surrounded by. During this portion of the run, I would fall 4 times. 2 hard falls and a cracked phone screen made me realize I was flying. I wasn't jogging or slowly running I was straight up sprinting and I didn't even realize it. Running fast while sober is great and fun. Running fast while on acid is on another level completely. The sun was going down and I was bleeding, cold, excited, and happy.

Miles 12-13 I was coming back into town. Following the sunset. The incredible colors painted in the sky and the clouds make me wish I could paint because I feel the only way I'd be able to describe this sunset is on canvas. The blues slowly turning into various shades of purples, pinks, oranges, reds, and yellows was a perfect view to follow back into town. The smells and sights once I was back in town were very different from the rest of my run understandably. I ran along the train tracks towards the old co-op. Before I got there I had to run behind a gasoline station and I could smell the fried chicken and cheese curds they had for sale the smells filled me up and encouraged me to run home so that I could make french fries. By the dumpsters behind the gasoline station were piles of sand and cigarette butts from where the ashtrays were dumped. I felt sad and also proud. I felt sad because I used to be a part of that group. I used to smoke from 15-23 I have just quit smoking a little over 3 months ago. Running past those piles of cigarette butts helped remind me that me quitting smoking wasn't just going to have a positive impact on my life but all of the lives around me. I'm proud that I quit smoking and I will say that it is hard and it sucks at times, but that it's worth it just like running is to all of us.

Miles .4 Running. I did not want to stop but the sun was going down and even though for me it is normal to run and to sometimes do acid I'd never mixed both before. I didn't want the fun to stop but I knew that my neighbors wouldn't appreciate a crazy young man running around the streets after dark while he was tripping balls on acid. So I did the only other thing I could do. I went home and hopped in the shower to wash the blood, sweat, dirt, and rust off of my exhausted body. Guys before I hopped in the shower I stood naked in front of my mirror and was so happy. I looked at my body, my face, my legs. I felt so proud of myself. Of the power in my legs. The goofy smile I had melted onto my face. I have never in my life felt as happy as I did standing in front of my mirror naked, coming down from this incredible runner's high, and watching the walls and ceiling breathe with me.

I watched documentaries after my shower and before falling asleep. I think what I learned the most from yesterday is that I take too much for granted and that I don't appreciate what I have. I am very lucky and I believe so are most of you.

I think that if I never do acid again I'd be okay with it because yesterday, honestly was life-changing and I need more time to analyze myself and to keep doing what drives me.

I have a decent list of reasons for needing a vest, my longest runs so far have been roughly 10 miles, but keeping snacks enough is difficult in my little shorts and I figured with it getting warmer having water with me will be nice. 

I went for a run today, and holy shit, I struggled. My normal slow pace is 10:00 - 10:30 per mile, and my HR (according to my Garmin) normally is within 140-150 at that pace. I was pushing 180 the whole time at my normal pace, even slowing down to 11-11:30. Did you have to spend a while adjusting to running with a vest on?

ultrarunning,cpb09e,Knee pain but not during running...help,"29M. Run 30-35 miles a week. 

I have been experiencing a lot of knee pain recently on my right knee and have no idea what it could be and wonder if I should be concerned or if it is just overuse. The pain occurs right below my kneecap almost around the patellar ligament and to the tibia/top of the shinbone. I should mention I feel 0 pain while running. However, I have started playing basketball again and the pain happens mainly when I play basketball. If I do a stepback, jump or a hard cut where I plant hard on that knee/leg, it will feel like it just gives out with quite a bit of sharp pain. The pain goes away quickly, but it will give out and cause pain at random times while I play. Occasionally, it will hurt if I try and get up from sitting or laying down and put all the pressure on that knee/leg. If I press hard on it, the top of the tibia/shin bone will become irritated. 

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted that I have been running every day for the past 35 days and will play basketball 1-2 hours every other day. Not sure if it is just overuse or something to be more concerned about.

ultrarunning,DynamiteOwens,Sesamoidectomy/Foot Surgery/Recovery - Any experience?,"Regrettably, after 3 years, I have given in and decided to have my left tibial sesamoid removed via surgery in a few weeks. I have managed to work around it for a couple of years. Tried bouts of all sorts of recovery to include complete rest, steroid injections, orthotics, physical therapy, and others.

Came about 3 years ago after buying a pair of running shoes I knew after the first mile were too narrow and hurt my foot. Thinking I was “breaking them in”, I stubbornly continued to run and developed sesamoiditis. It has gradually got worse over time. I ran my last race two years ago and it was a trail half marathon. Today I can go about an hour to hour and a half running until the pain sets in and can do little climbing or sprints. It is a demoralizing injury. I run every other day still and in zero drop shoes it is tolerable. It has almost pushed me exclusively to road running. It’s been terrible. Needless to say, I am okay with my decision to pursue surgery. I truthfully avoided it at all costs.

ultrarunning,spack6789,Today I ran my first ultra since my DNF last summer!,"Hey everyone!

Last August I DNFed about 60 miles in during my first attempt at running a 100 miler. It was over the same weekend as the North Downs Way 100 - some of you might remember how hot it was! The heat really messed with my nutrition plan and I stopped at the advice of my crew after I was showing signs of heat exhaustion (definitely the right call!). I've certainly learned a lot from the whole experience, particularly regarding nutrition; I didn't have a backup plan, so once I started feeling nauseous enough that I couldn't keep down solid food I began to lose the battle against the bonk. 

I took the whole thing pretty badly in the aftermath, because had I tried it on a cooler day things might have gone a little differently (especially annoying because I felt like my legs had so much left in them!). I sort of lost interest in running afterwards - until recently!

It feels like that ""spark"" which spurred me through the training last year is back. I've been upping the mileage over the past few weeks, and after completing only a few longer-distance runs since August I went out and ran 50k today! It was the first time I'd done more than 20ish miles since then, and it felt amazing to be back out there. 

I'm actually signed up the NDW100 this coming August and I'm finally feeling motivated about the training. I think that going into this training block I'm actually in a better position than last year because of all the lessons I learned from the DNF. I'll be sure to experiment a lot more with my nutrition plan so that I can avoid what happened last year (I might finally give tailwind a try!).

When I ran my marathon my watch said 24.3""4800' but the race organizers insisted it was 26.2+5500'.

## Training

I had an issue with my knee that made it so I was unable to run for most of December 2020. By early January, I was able to start building up mileage. I gradually worked up to \~70 miles a week throughout most of March. I was doing cross training on Mondays, tempo runs on Tuesday/Thursdays, easy run on Wednesdays, long run on Saturdays, and a moderate length run on Sundays . During this block, I was also doing some strength training based on information from David and Megan Roche's Happy Runner.

Toward the end of last year I also started paying more attention to cadence and found that I was usually averaging around 150 steps per minute on my typical training runs. Since then, I have been trying to gradually increase that number. I worked up to close to 160 for most of this training block and am planning to work that number up for future blocks.

I had attempted this same route, in the opposite direction, back in August of last year and had to give up about 46 miles into it after dealing with dehydration due to not having enough water to work through the heat.

## Pre-run

I was thinking the route was going to take me between 12 to 16 hours to complete so I setup my pack to have all the food I would need for 17 hours just to be on the safe side. I have done a couple other ultras and have had luck with rotating peanuts, energy gels, and bits of a Clif bar around every 20 minutes, so I used that same strategy for this event. I used the Salomon Adv Skin 12 which had enough room for that food, some first aid supplies, and my 0.6L Katadyn BeFree. I filled up the two 0.5L soft flasks and the Katadyn before starting.

For my attempt in August 2020, I filled up water bottles at drinking fountains along the way. The water fountains were not turned on during this attempt, so I had to rely on pulling water from rivers and lakes with the Katadyn.

The temperatures were going to go from cloudy and 32F in the morning up to 55F and sunny at the hottest part of the day. I started with a warm hat, jacket, and gloves with the plan that I would eventually take off as it got warmer out.

I didn't set any goal time, because I did not want to have any reason to push the pace beyond what I was finding comfortable at the time.

During last year's failed attempt I ran from Gaylord up to Mackinaw City since getting to finish in front of the Mackinaw Bridge seemed like a nice way to close out the day. This time I went Mackinaw City to Gaylord since Gaylord had better post-run vegetarian food options open at the time. The trail is pretty flat so it didn't make a big difference to me running-wise which direction I ran it.

## Run

# Mackinaw City to Cheboygan – 16.3 miles

My wife dropped me off at 5am at the trailhead. I started out with a plan of alternating 9 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. The entire trail is flat so I wanted some ability to mix in walking since there are no hills to hike up. This section was just a straight shot with some trees on either side of the path and the occasional views of Lake Huron. It was rather uneventful as I was able to stick to my eating and drinking plan and kept the pace easy. Highlights included a beautiful sunrise and numerous deer, raccoon, and turkey spottings.

# Cheboygan to Topinabee – 11.9 miles

In Cheboygan, there was a nice facility next to the path that had benches and, in the warmer months, a drinking fountain and bathroom. I used this as an opportunity to switch out my warmer hat and gloves with some lighter ones. I also refilled my two front bottles with what I had stored up in the Katadyn.

Most of this stretch runs along Mullet Lake. The sun started to poke out and there were tons of beachy segments with minimal shade. I was able to find a public boat launch into Mullet Lake where I used the Katadyn to refill all my bottles. I ended up getting one foot soaked, which was a little annoying for a few miles, but then it dried out.

# Topinabee to Indian River – 5.6 miles

There was a nice spot to stop and sit along the path in Topinabee, but I ended up moving past since Indian River was not far ahead and I had just made a stop to fill up bottles. I was able to mostly keep up my pace and eating plan, but started working in some more frequent stretching as I was starting to get more sore.

# Indian River to Wolverine – 9.6 miles

My pace started slowing down a bit here as I was starting to have a tougher time taking in enough water and eating with the heat. I feel like 55F and sunny is probably not too hot for most people, but to a person who had been been training through a Michigan winter the past few months it was hitting me hard. I stopped at the Rondo bridge to sit down, refill all the water bottles, and move some food around.

# Wolverine to Vanderbilt - 10.9 miles

This is where I really started to have some issues.  The sun was beating down pretty hard and I was having a tough time finding a spot to refill water. I was trying to make my water stretch out as best I could, but was definitely not taking in the water I needed. During this time, I kept increasing the amount of time I was walking relative to running. Just as I was switching to only walking, I ended up finding a creek in the shade that looked like it was moving just quickly enough to be alright to filter. I ended up spending some time just sitting in the shade and trying to catch up on food and water intake.

After the break, I started to feel better as I got more water into my system. I was ended up working back to an 8 minute run and 2 minute walk plan.

# Vanderbilt to Gaylord - 7.6 miles

I took one last sitting break in Vanderbilt to recover, shuffle some food/trash around my pack, and move the water from the Katadyn to the front bottles. At this point, my legs were pretty sore. I was getting occasional cramps in my thighs and calves that I was able to walk and stretch my way out of. Besides the cramps, I was able to push through with a relatively consistent 4 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. I had a group of cows come right up to their feeble-looking fence along the path and stare at me, which made me slow to a cautious walk as I passed them.

After a long day, the idea of just being done took over and I ended up picking up the pace to run my quickest pace of the day and was greeted by my wife with some water, fresh snacks, and new clothes.

## Post-run

We got takeout from Snowbelt Brewery. I got a tater tot waffle covered in mac and cheese. I had a tough time sleeping between feeling too hot or too cold and just general soreness. I was pretty sore the whole next day, but doing some walking, stretching, and using a massager on my legs helped me feel quite a bit better by the end of the day.  The next day I went on a 2 mile run and that really helped speed up the recovery.

I plan on submit the activity to fastestknowntime.com.

I struggled to find running shoes that didn't cause too much discomfort, and after running in several pairs of Nikes and whatever was on sale locally, I ended up truly comfortable for the first time in a pair of Saucony Endorphin Shifts coupled with my aging half-length orthotic inserts.

I ran my first 50k last year in the Shifts and they performed well on light trail and road. However, much of my training this year will be on trail, culminating in an 80km trail run on highly technical trail. Thus, I need some proper trail shoes.

I am looking for a wide toe-box, decent support, and enough comfort for a 10+ hours at a time. Given COVID lockdowns, trying on a selection in store is a ways off - so I'm turning to reddit for advice.

ultrarunning,JungusFungus,Injuries and easing back into running,"Last January I completed my first trail race, a 50k, and absolutely fell in love with ultrarunning and the idea of doing a 100 miler. After the race I signed up for a 50 miler and kept running but noticed some discomfort in my left hip and knee. I pushed through the pain for a little while but decided to hang up the shoes for a few months over the winter and I have only now just started running again. However, I keep getting a deep, dull pain in my left hip and lower knee. I've had issues with IT band pain before but the pain in the hip seems different. I've tried stretching, rolling, and changing my run form and shoes, but so far no dice. I've also been trying to get on the bike but have been having pains in my left knee, just below the patella. 

Has anyone experienced issues with hip and knee pain, potentially from overuse? I can't tell if I should see a PT or try more home exercises/workouts before consulting a professional. I'm signed up for a half-Ironman in June so I'd love to be able to get back on the road and in the saddle.

* **Name:** Alpine Challenge

### A seed was planted
Four years ago a physio introduced me to the idea of ultras:
“I was hallucinating by the second night. I tried as hard as I could to descend a never-ending mountain, but it felt like I was under water. It took me hours to realise I had been striving to run uphill, not down”.

I asked what the event was called, and he said The Alpine Challenge. His calm recollection of these absurd impressions intrigued me. I also felt a stab of terror, because I knew that I might be tempted, and saw a possible fate unroll into the future.

### Build-up
Oct 2019: first ultra.

Feb 2020 - Feb 2021: a fantastic set of uninterrupted training blocks between solo ultras. Usually 100k (60M) weeks with ~3000m (10,000ft) of elevation and regular unfocused speedwork. Two overnight adventures including my first 100 mile run.

I worked up to steeper and sketchier terrain than I would encounter in the Alpine Challenge. I linked up appealing remote features through trial and error. This experimentation required problem solving, and conditioned me (to a degree) to exposure as I practised scrambling and basic climbing. I hoped this approach would limit my fears about the race, but I was still very afraid!

The last two months forced me to skip most speedwork, almost all strength training and my peak mileage weeks. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to race even 24hrs before the event. I felt lucky when things aligned and I got the all clear to race.

### About The Race
The Alpine Challenge is a glorious loop that passes through some of the most spectacular country in Australia. The course crests three of the highest peaks in the area: Bogong, Hotham and Feathertop (each is ~2000m or 6,500ft). Its trails are mostly soft underfoot as it travels sparse alpine landscapes, rainforest, misty eucalypt valleys and jagged rocky spurs.

The course is famously hard, even to international runners that are comfortable in higher mountains. People struggle with the snow and fog, the cold, the navigation, the steep rocky descents and the long climbs. In 2019 the DNF rate was above 50%.

### My race
We began in the dark. An icy river crossing shortly after sunrise preceded the first major climb.

There I bumped into a friendly runner I’d met once before. He was friendly, inquisitive and interesting. This was his first miler, and he’d trained well. He too hoped for sub-30 hours, but not at the cost of a DNF - my approach exactly. We ran together and talked. This pleasant chatty vibe was refreshing. I’d never raced with anyone before.

Two loyal helpers had taken time off work and driven seven hours to support my new friend. Their job might have been harder than ours - they were up at three AM and spent the day driving hours between aid stations. I saw up close how selfless and inspiring that is, and how much he appreciated it. I was quite moved. His friends were funny as fuck, which was a nice counter point to our sincere banter.

One of them joined us as pacer for the last third of the race. Have you ever tried to keep a three year old focused on one task for twelve hours? That’s how hard his job was.

At midnight we encountered civilisation - the Harrietville Hotel, a gorgeous pub in a small town which was doubling as an aid station. People often quit here. You’re about 120k in (75M), broken, and nestled in a nice pub between two mountains in a chair by a fire. There is laughter and the sound of beer glasses chinking.  Who in their right mind would leave this heavenly environment to begin the biggest climb and the hardest section of the course. It’s midnight, it’s freezing.

Luckily I have been warned about the seductive dangers of chär by ultra running memes. Chair is dangerous. Chair will swallow you. Must leave chair.

One of my friend’s crew chased me down the street as we left the pub:
“Do you want these?”
He was holding out my thermals and my water bladder.

The next 13km were all uphill. My headtorch died. My backup headtorch died. My friend offered me his backup headtorch and it died. I used my iphone’s torch, but the temperatures caused the battery to plummet, so I walked in the dark between my friend and his pacer, rhythmically stepping off the trail to plan footsteps in the torchlight behind me.

Mt Feathertop’s imposing silhouette appeared when we cleared the treeline, illuminated by the most stars I’d ever seen. I saw a shooting star. This was the moment for me when the race delivered everything I’d hoped for. Three people about to bag a peak at 4am, in the middle of nowhere, under the milky way.

The sunrise from Diamantina Spur was equally beautiful, on all scales from the psychedelic wild flowers and swirling rock formations at my feet to the plunging spur we stood on, to the valley below and the mountains above it, and the profile of Feathertop around us, which we’d just been up. I fucking love my life sometimes. I laughed at how bad my photos were and soaked it in.

If I wanted the sub-30 finish I knew I’d have to maintain a normal weekend long-run pace for the last four hours. Going off on my own didn’t feel right though after twenty four hours of solidarity. The clinching factor was that Strava had shat itself and lost my entire recording. If I ran with my buddy I could tag myself in his recording.

I re-joined my friends and we pushed up the last big climb. Our pacer silently coaxed us into properly running the last 15km (~10M), including all of the uphills. I was happy to be pushing because I knew it would likely stop us from being overtaken, and I calculated that we had a top twenty spot. Wholesome to see my new friend was tearing up and relishing his experience. He held my hand to cross the finish line, but it turned out to be 100m too early. We awkwardly unheld hands, then held them again.

Someone put a beer in my hand. Neither of us puked or bled. Success!

ultrarunning,Running-foodie,Halp! I’m scared of caffeine!,"I’ve got a 100miler coming up and I am worried about consuming too much caffeine. 

I drink a couple of coffees a day normally and if I’m doing a particularly long training run, I’ll probably have a couple of spring energy Speednut gels which have 50mg caffeine in them. 

In my last 100miler, I avoided caffeine for fear of heart palpitations, the jitters, or just “eventful” trips to the bathroom. I had maybe 3x 50mg caffeine gels in the race. 

Inevitably I was desperately tired from about mile 70 and my alertness was that of a cucumber. Can’t help but think if I took on some more caffeine, things would have been easier. 

I know everyone’s tolerance is different, but I’d be interested in hearing peoples experiences with over/under using caffeine.

I’ve been running for almost two decades now and consider myself fairly experienced and in tune with my body. I’ve done many road races and a couple of ultras but now, as of this new year, I became a vegetarian to support my vegan wife. Yes, Vegan is too hard core/disciplined for me and I would not be a happy person without my cheese and eggs. 

Good news is that I’ve made the transition surprisingly well, no easing in, and haven’t noticed any ability loss in my running. I’d say that it’s helped me, in fact, as I feel less heavy in my runs. The drawback? I shit and fart to damn much now - annoying. 

Anyway, to the matter at hand. I have a few ultras I signed up for this year and these will be the first I’ll do as a veggie and I’m somewhat concerned about my caloric intake that I hope to be aided with not only what I carry but on myself.

ultrarunning,emptytrashbagobject,"How do you accommodate the ""format"" mileage training schedules (based on mileage) into the various trail/vert/technical runs that you do your actual training on?","I come from a background of track/road running where all training schedules are done by mileage and pace.   This obviously doesn't work the same when you are doing your training runs on hilly technical trails where a 10k run which would take you 40 minutes on the road takes you an hour and a half on the trails. 

Specifically I am following Hal Koerner's book where his plans are based on mileage.  Is the assumption that you would just run those miles on the same ""type"" of trails you would run the race on?  So if it says to go for an 8 mile run, that run should not be on a flat road but on the similar trail (vertical gain/loss, roots, rocks etc.) as the race?  It obviously vastly changes the amount of time you spend running depending on where you do your run.  It could potentially take you over twice as long to do the same weekly program depending on if you just go out and do the miles on the road or the miles on the trails.

Note: His plan builds in hill training and fartlek runs etc., which is why I'm just not sure if he accounts for where you do the prescribed mileage runs.",1617736459

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation.

While research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. To this end I have designed a survey and I would like to enlist your kind help. I believe that this subReddit is the perfect venue.

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will be using  the data to write several research overviews. When the analysis is completed, I will be only too happy to report back in this subReddit.

The survey can be found at this link:

Supposed to attempt this Saturday--not too worried about heat/elevation/environment as I live/train in the desert. I've been running trails and getting a lot of vert (not nearly the amount I'll get in the canyon). I ran a 50k last weekend in 6:54 but definitely did get really tired from it and had moments in the middle where I questioned if I could really do R2R2R.

I keep reading things about how hard it is, how people die, and how it shouldn't be undertaken without months of specific training.

ultrarunning,Laresu,How valuable is a shoe which works for you?,"Hey all,

I know the only thing more annoying than asking for shoe advice is asking ‘why does my knee hurt?’, but I’ve got a more general query than just looking for shoe recommendations.

I began my trail running about 18 months ago in a pair of Salomon Sense Ride 2’s, which have been really good to me. After putting many hundreds of km’s through them, I’ve decided that it’s time for a new pair of shoes. 

I went straight for the Sense Ride 4’s, since that is the current iteration, but found that they seem far more firm under foot than the 2’s, so I’ve been turned off them. So now I’m cast out into the the big wide world of shoes, with endless options at my fingertips - Altra’s, Hoka’s, many shiny new things catching my eye.

I have, however, also been able to find a pair of the ole reliable 2’s online - seemingly one of the last few floating around. Given I have gone 18 months (touchwood) injury free and with no major issues or hotspots/blisters etc. in them, I assume they’re good shoes for me - but because I started my running journey in them, I just don’t know how much ‘better’ things could be, because I’ve never tried anything else. 

I guess the crux of my question is: how value is a reliable shoe? Is it a case of ‘stick with it at all costs, because they’re like gold’, or is it ‘branch out, because it’ll be okay and you’ll most likely be fine with your new shoes (or even better)’? I just haven’t sampled enough shoes to know what I like in terms of stack height, drop, etc., let alone what might prevent/cause injuries to me.

I'm doing the New England Challenge this May (6 days, 6 states, marathon each day). December 2019, I did Four Corners series (similar idea...4 states, 4 days) except for that series I had my parents with me. This was huge because they drove us to/from each day and helped me make food each evening (we stayed in an AirBNB).

This time, I am traveling solo. I will be traveling to a new hotel each day, travel times between race locations will be anywhere between 30 minutes and 2 hrs.

I know from Four Corners that things I've got to do as soon as I get to the hotel are: some movement/walking, extra foam rolling, slap on my AirRelax boots, eat some food, and take a nap. I also know I need to plan some extra food on the drive between hotels. I realize I'll be burning a lot of calories each day, but I also don't think I should just plan to eat pizza/quick gas station food each day either. That seems like it will catch up with me by day 4-6. I also learned that while I needed to eat, at the end of the day, my ability to eat a lot was somewhat limited, so calorie dense is a bonus (I did a lot of tuna pasta salad during Four Corners).

I'm looking for advice on  
\- Easy road foods that I can either make the night before in a hotel room for post-race travel (was thinking maybe PB&amp;J sandwiches)?  
\- Food for eating in the afternoon/evening to refuel once I'm at the hotel. Hopefully things that I might be able to make prior to leaving and will keep for a little over a week (I'm driving, so I can pack a cooler). Or things that I can have the components and can easily make in the hotel.  
\- Other food/nutrition options that I should plan to bring with me. I won't have anyone to make a grocery run for me, so the less I need to travel out after each day, the better it seems.  
\- Anything else I should consider in terms of logistics.  
\- Contingency planning: What should I do if I get to next hotel and I can't check in for a few hours

I'm confident in my ability to tackle the series since I did Four Corners, which was much more technically difficult running (trails, lots of elevation), but I don't have much prior experience with regards to logistics of making this as easy for myself to be successful managing it. For what it's worth also, I'm hoping to finish in about 5hrs for each day of racing.",1617214736

I have consistent 50k weeks over the last 9 months but this was a last minute idea and i am not sure how i would even train for it. A huge step

### Pre-race

I had a down week to prepare but nothing else to note. A huge part of this challenge would be logistics and i am working from home due to lockdown, we have a 4 month old baby, a dog and my wife (freelancer) is back working nights. This led to a pretty mad schedule as the month progressed where our day looked like this:

7.00am - Get baby up, have something light to eat

8:00am - Nanny arrives and i run for 60 mins with dog

9-12 - work, sneak out for lunch run, wife gets up

5:00pm - nanny leaves, i take baby out for run (catnap) + dog

6-7.15pm - bedtime etc for baby

7.30pm we eat

9:00pm I go to bed, wife leaves for work

2:00am - i do night feed

5:00am - wife gets back from work, i get up and run 

7:00am - i get baby up...

Due to this slightly bonkers schedule i knew i could not 1 bang each run as there was no way i could get 2+ hours free at one time. Therefore, i planned to split days into multiple runs.

I had two pairs of shoes to rotate between, Reebok Floatride Energy 3 Shoes and NB 1080 v11's.

I tried to do a 15 minute flexibility routine each day (bodyweight warrior on youtube) but this did fall away as the month went on. I concentrated on stretching my glutes and used a massage gun on my calves

### Race

I nailed day 1! My plan was to run at a really low heart rate (i use Garmin 945 + chest strap) with a target HR of &lt;130. This equates to 6 minute km's for me, slower with baby in tow.

I chugged away through the first 2 weeks with no dramas. Mentally i felt like day 21 would be the first mental barrier and that was my goal. I had a post run mini bonk on about day 17 which was a reminder of how important hydration is - lesson learnt. Once a day, after the longest run, i would take some SiS Rego powder with frozen berries and milk as my recovery drink + a hydration tablet. Other than that i just ate a normal diet - i did eat whatever i wanted, whenever i wanted. Interestingly i put on about 1kg during this but am not sure if it is my body freaking out or just me going a bit mad with Deliveroo. 

Running with a running buggy is hard, especially 15k+ and i really felt it in my glutes on the next non buggy run. This would have been impossible with a running buggy and it was enjoyable to share the experience with the baby. 

I listened to alot of podcasts, audiobooks and Spotify during the runs using Aftershokz headphones which i would highly recommend. 

I did day 25 in a 1 bang before work as my wife wasnt working and felt great, the next goal being getting to the 27th as this was the weekend which was normally easier. Unfortunately the baby got a cold which meant he stopped sleeping more than an hour which left me running on fumes somewhat. This challenge was never going to be straightforward and i kept positive, ticking off the runs and the days.

I found the 28th to be the hardest as i had a couple of beers the night before, no sleep and the cumulative effort was telling. The 3rd run of the day, a 9k with running buggy was seriously hard but once done i knew i would finish the whole thing.

I took day 31 off work so i could do it in 1 and met my cousin who was also doing the challenge. We  chatted round and i enjoyed the last 5k on my own. I really enjoyed the interest and support on Strava/friends/work and wanted to write this up to share the idea and see if anyone else wants to take it on.

### Post-race

I have a bottle of bubbles in the fridge and am going to nail a pizza tonight. I reckon i will be asleep before the 2nd glass and 3rd slice!

I have no real injuries to report, just a few niggles but thats to be expected. I have a small blister on my left foot and i bruised the top of my right foot on about day 27 as either i did my laces up too tight or my foot swelled up (or both). I plan to take the next two week easy but do lots of walking and active recovery and then do a 70k run in June.

ultrarunning,Bisto74,Foot bump,"Hi all

I've had a strange bump appear on my left foot after having run 11 miles back in December and it does not want to go away.

Doesn't particularly hurt but about a 3 on the irritation scale.

I've had 2 X-rays that have come back all clear and I've seen a Podiatrist who checked everything mechanically and seems to think it's fine. The reality is though I've done something to it and it seems that I'm now getting a Bunion which apparently can happen as a resort of a foot  trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual suspects have been ruled out and logic would lean towards some sort of joint damage.

Last year I actually put in more miles running (371 total) than I ever have, though my overall steps were way down from working from home.  I am pacing a pretty rigorous ultra in June, with my expected contribution to be the last 30 miles of a 67 mile race.  In January, I started upping my mileage, and it felt good while running, but the recovery has been terrible.  I got up to 28 miles in the third week of January but the recovery from muscle soreness has been miserable.  Right now I seem to only be able to do 10-20 miles a week.  

I have been trying to supplement running with resistance bands and yoga, but every minor workout takes a week to recover from.  I am 42 years old, 5'10"" and 195 pounds so I am no spring chicken.  I take a daily multivitamin, Flaxseed, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, and Calcium and Magnesium.  I use a lacrosse ball and foam roller daily.

I am a graduate student in the Kinesiology department at San Francisco State University. I'm conducting qualitative research on the experiences and lives of participants in the sports of ultradistance trail running, adventure racing, and triathlon.

**I'm working to recruit one to two more participants who fit the following criteria:**

1. You are an ultradistance runner (meaning, you have at least one running event of 50k or further that you prepare for throughout the year)
2. You have at least 3 years experience in the sport
3. You are 18 to 29 years old
4. IF (this is not a requirement) you are a student and/or parent, I would be especially interested in recruiting you to participate in this research.

*Participation in this research includes 3 parts: First, I’ll ask you to complete a demographic questionnaire using an online form. Then, I'll ask you to participate in an individual interview via Zoom, taking between 1.5 to 2 hours, focusing on the ways your sport participation affects your life and the ways your life affects your sport participation. Finally, I may contact you within three months of your interview with a few follow-up questions that will take about  15 minutes to answer. The total time participating in this research will be about 2.5 hours.*

Have had metartarsalgia in outer most metatarsal joint for the past month or so. It wasn't so bad for a while and never hurt while running, only slight gait differences when waking in middle of the night. It only got so bad a few weeks ago following a 100 mi wk and self-supp 50 mi that I've had to stop running against my will. (I know, maybe I flew too close to the sun, like my man Icarus). We can likely only blame ourselves when our wings are burning.

2 weeks off from running has me slipping. When running has saved you from past vices, they come rising back when running is not there. First week off was not so bad. Substituting with biking was fun, but only because I thought I might return to running the next week or week after next.

ultrarunning,thatcrazyrunnergirl,How I won the first ultramarathon I ran (50 miles) race recap/my training,"Hello ultrarunners of reddit- new member here, so great for us to have this community! 

Last week I ran my first ever 50 mile ultramarathon (St. George Lake to Lake 50 mile) and somehow managed to swoop in for 1st place in the women's ultra. Ran 9:43, which I know is not such a crazy amazing time to write home about, I was a bit disappointed since I had planned to not only break 9 hours, but really wanted to break 8 hours.... and I thought I could based on my training... but things don't always go how you plan them. 

Training: 

First off, really stepped up my weekly volume from previously 45-60 MPW, gradually going all the way up to 80 MPW. That was definitely scary for me, but my body adapted so well, I honestly felt like I could've done more, but of course, since it was my first ultra, I didn't want to push things and get injured. 

2) I really amped up my strength training for this training block. Previously, when I finally managed to qualify for Boston (3 times now) I noticed adding a little bit of strength training to my routine paid out HUGE dividends, so I decided if I really wanted to run longer, faster, and stronger, I needed to kick it up a notch in that department. I pretty much doubled the length of my workouts (squats, lunges, core work, resistance band training for hips and glutes etc.) and added more plyo training i.e. jump squats. After mostly all of these workouts I was sore the next day, but I tried to balance it (with decent success) so that I wouldn't be so sore that when I went to run it would get in the way. After I got warmed up the soreness would quiet down. 

3) Speed work 2x a week with lots of variety. Sometimes longer tempo runs, some progression runs, mile repeats, yassos, just tried to switch it up every week to something different. 

4) long runs. I did back to back long run every weekend (shorter 10-15 mile distance on Sat and then 30-40 mile distance on Sunday). Basically all of my long runs (maxing out at 10/40 back to back Saturday/Sunday) I was able to run at 9:30 or less a mile. So I was really planning on running under 8 hours on the race. Sadly, on dice for me this time around. I really wish somehow I could've gotten some heat training in... I knew my race was going to be in St. George, but it was March and I was hoping the heat wouldn't really hit me this early in the year. But alas, giant heat wave came in just the weekend of my race bringing temps from mid 50s up near the 80s just for me. That pretty much killed me for a good 3 hours where I was running 12 minute miles.  

Race Day: 

Got started at 7am at killed it, right on target pace for the first 25 miles. I was doing great on hydration, nutrition, heart rate zone, no blisters, everything... Of course then day heated up and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I kept dunking my shirt in water to keep myself cool, but it was still brutal. I do badly in the heat just in general, way worse than the average runner. But especially coming from training all winter long in Utah (my hottest run was when I trained on the course 3 weeks prior and it was 50 degrees) I just couldn't handle it very well. I did manage to keep running, at least, never had to stop and walk (other than very short intervals on really steep and gravelly hills where I just felt like running was inefficient). But in the end, it didn't matter too much as it turned out the women's field competition was not very steep, and 9:43 was enough to snag 1st place after all. 

Definitely will be coming back and trying to break that 8 hours barrier though...

She also rock climbs and has summited a few PNW peaks, so she’s passionate about mountaineering as well. One thing she really doesn’t enjoy is skiing!

Which book would be better choice? Is Uphill Athlete too focused on skiing? Is New Alpinism not focused on running at all? I couldn’t quite find specifics but read good reviews - but I did read they overlap a lot and I wouldn’t need to buy both.

One thing she and I both want to learn more about is running nutrition - if there is a book that has good info on how the body functions during endurance sports and what nutrients are required and do what/go where, that would be really good.

ultrarunning,ukclimb,Watch recommendation,"I replaced my Suunto Spartan Ultra with a Suunto 9 Baro last week which i've just sent back.

I had some big discrepancies in performance mode and was plain wrong when compared against my old Spartan. The wrist HR was widely inaccurate although I wasn't expecting much from it.

So back to the drawing board for a new watch, my criteria is:-

Use - trail running and mountaineering, mainly UK.

Accurate ascent/descent and altitude. Needs an altimeter/barometer.

Navigation - breadcrumb at the least. Ability to upload gpx files. Colour maps nice but not essential.

Battery - at least 24 hrs (need to be able to use in navigation mode for up to 24hrs).

HR monitor - after my experience with the 9 I really have zero confidence in these now. But if there is an accurate one i'd be interested, otherwise I have a chest belt so this feature is not essential.

Design - it would be nice to have a sleek design for a change. The Spartan/9 Baro are cumbersome under a running jacket sleeve or mountain gloves.

Price - any

ultrarunning,mannidung,Running 5x a week w/ Double day vs. 6 days a week,"Morning all!

I'm starting a mileage increase phase for a 90k in August, and I'm considering two different approaches. I currently run 5 times a week with two rest days. My mileage is around 50-60k per week and I aim to (slowly) increase to 70-90k per week.

I'm choosing between the following ways to increase the mileage:

1. Run 6 times a week, decreasing to one rest day. This would probably be a run of about one hour in length.

2. Take one of my workout days (I run my WO in the morning) and run once more in the afternoon/evening (easy run). This would probably be a run of 30-60 mins depending on how the schedule for the evening is.

My reasoning is the following.

Pros:
1. I would get a couple of more km in every week compared to 2, and I can do this run in the morning, which makes it less stressful.

2. I would keep 2 rest days each week, and according to a Koop podcast (can't remember which), an extra rest day decreases the risk of injury substantially.

Cons: 
1. I would lose one rest day.

2. Some weeks it might be hard to fit in a second running the evening due to job stuff.

I'm not able to find any good literature on this and would love to hear if you have tried one way or the other (or even both), and what your experiences have been. Which one would you go with?",1615715252

I had a big breakfast and had eaten 400 calories and 100mg caffeine during the run. Got seven hours of sleep last night, though haven’t slept great this week and had a pretty big training day yesterday.

ultrarunning,rollocking,Need advice: Training for my first 50k and Olympic triathlon at the same time,"Quick background on me: I’ve run a handful of marathons and will be training for my first ultra (50k so barely an ultra, but on trail with decent elevation gain close to 10k) through this spring for a race in early august. Due to race cancellations and delays from the past year, I also have an Olympic triathlon race in late July, and so I’ll be having to balance training for both in overlap for quite a while, basically until it’s time to taper for the trail 50k.

Currently, my weekly baseline routine puts me at about 20-30 mpw running, with maybe 10-15 of that in trail, and 50-100 mpw biking. I lift twice a week for injury prevention and as the weather gets nice I plan to throw in some swim/run split days. Obviously I’ll have to be bumping my weekly mileage to somewhere around 50-60 mpw at least for the ultra with way more on trail, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get the most bang for your buck in terms of avoiding injury and sneaking in some other workouts on the bike.

I’m comfortable at this point that I could easily get through the triathlon no problem, although of course I want to be competitive. The ultra scares me a bit more. I know this is an entirely self-induced problem, but has anyone here done something similar or have advice on cross training vs. running split?

Koop prescribes steady state runs at an RPE of 7 and as I’m a bit new to RPE as well as steady runs in general, I’m looking for a rough HR equivalent.

For reference, I typically run (with estimated RPE):

- very easy/recovery ~125-135bpm (RPE 4-5)
- easy/endurance ~135-150bpm (RPE 5-6)
- tempo/threshold ~ &lt;178bpm (RPE 9)
- vo2 Max ~ &gt;178bpm (RPE 10)

I would think an RPE of 7 would land me somewhere around 160bpm. Koop seems to suggest these runs should be closer to the threshold side without tipping over (perhaps around 165), whereas others seem to reference steady runs at a slightly more laboured aerobic effort (perhaps more like 155).

 I'm looking to upgrade from my old 735xt.  my activity are running, MTB and indoor rowing (mostly) and skiing and trekking whenever I'm able to go (I live in Chile, mountains are not too far thoug).

I been looking around, and the natural choice would be a fenix series or FR945 (745 maybe?), but I far from using and understaning the amount of information and complexity tha those options produce - don't misunderstand me they are fantastic watches, but I doubt that I'm gonna use all the features they have. 

The thing is, I wanted to track my activities and have a good measure of them but not ending buying an expensive watch that I'll not use all their capability (likely too bulky)- I really like the recovery advisor of my 735xt thoug.

So I wonder if any one is wearing a Coros Apex Pro (because battery life and comments of their software updates) or a Polar Grit X (brand  history and reliability) that can give some advice and which one should I pick up...or if  I should go for another alternative.

ultrarunning,joejance,"Aerobic Threshold Tests, HR vs PRE questions","Has anyone done an aerobic threshold test to set up training zones? Nose breathing test? Self administered blood lactate test? The full lab run? Did you get benefit from it?

Last year was my first year tackling actual ultras. When I started my training for last year I switched to using Perceived Rate of Exertion to guide the intensity of my training runs (based on Jason Koop's book). 

Before then I had run a variety of sub-ultra distance races. Back then I had setup HR zones on my watch based on my LT (discovered using a track test) and resting HR, using Garmin's HRR% algorithm. Switching to PRE seemed natural to me, as HR seemed really variable on trail and from day to day.

Now I'm training for a 50 mile trail ultra this summer, which will be my longest run with most elevation gain. I'm in the middle of reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and the authors discuss aerobic threshold and heart rate zones *a lot*. They have me thinking about my aerobic base again, and I'm questioning if my PRE 4-5 runs really are under my aerobic threshold.

Let's say I do an aerobic threshold test and discover I'm aerobic deficient. Do I go back to use HR to guide my runs? Try to readjust what PRE means to me? Am I overthinking this?",1614366777

| B | Don’t die | *Yes* |
| A | Finish race | *YES* |


### 1: Disclaimer and 2: what the hell am I talking about:
1: Don't do this shit. 2: I got the brilliant idea of running an ultramarathon on LSD after a bucket list discussion at work. Doing things like climbing everest and running ultras came up, as did taking some of the drugs you've never tried. I thought that combining these things would make for a fun year to remember.

### Training
Running back and forth to work on weekdays (about six three miles one way) in order to prepare for running a 50 mile ultramarathon. Long runs on weekends. Taking LSD to see if I can handle it.  I could, and I enjoyed it enough to keep going with my experiment.

Running one 10K event on LSD: it was a success and the most fun I’ve ever had in a night!  

### Pre-race

The wife drove me to the starting line out in the woods as I was still sleeping. Thank you wifey. 

I felt like an outsider once we got to where the race was starting off. Everyone was wearing stuff that looked like it was designed for running, while I was wearing woolen underwear and gray gym shorts and a green hoodie above them. Others were wearing skimpy hydration packs, I wore an old hiking backpack I had used while backpacking over in Europe. And everyone and their mother had these GPS watches that probably cost more than all of my stuff + race fee combined. 

I was surprised to see that 3/10, maybe even 4/10 of the runners were women. A large number of the men were bearded. How many of them had plastic bags of LSD in their pockets I didn’t know, but they were quiet a hippie-looking-bunch of people none the less. 

### Race
### 

It was dark when the race started at six in the morning, and it made for a cool atmosphere with all the headlamps when the gun went off. Some 150 people I would guess were there to prove themselves during the day that followed. 

The hoodie went into the backpack fast as I got warm from running. We ran the first part of the race next to a lake that reflected all the stars, which was nice. While those aiming for glory and first place had sprinted off in the beginning, most people where still in one big pack. Hearing the all the shoes hit the gravel in unison had me feeling this was much more of a teams sport than it was. People were talking about what prior races they had run, what injuries they had fought over the year and what nutrition they had brought. While I didn’t find myself all that interested in the subjects other runners were bringing up, one of the biggest surprises was how connected I felt to the people I was out with. Running an entire night with a group of people like could probably be a spiritual experience on its own.


### Ninety Minutes after ingestion - where is my high?
Ninety minutes had passed since I had put the tabs of LSD in the mouth, and I had run some 15 miles and taken nearly 30-thousand steps according the the wife’s Fitbit on my wrist. On 200 micrograms I would definitely have expected to be tripping by now, but I was kinda bummed out thinking this wouldn’t work out until really I found myself really sad thinking of all the people who died and lost friends and family in the 2004 tsunami. All feelings are amplified on psychedelics, but I would have very much liked another feeling than sadness to amplify on this day. 

At least getting distracted was easy thanks to the girl in the ponytail I started following who held a good pace for me. Focusing on their hair swinging left and right like a pendulum made for a good thing to focus on. The packs had thinned out some time ago, and now people were sorted by speed into different groups - I had made my way from one of the slower ones to one that was a bit more ambitious. 

I was admiring the woman ahead of me. She was quite obviously well trained by the looks of her legs and butt, but I felt strongly connected to her to the point of embarrassment when I thought about how we were both out here on this day going through the same hardships. 

Was I in love? I don’t know, but I remember thinking about our potential life together. Full of running adventures all over the world, and our babies would be genetically engineered to be great endurance athletes. It got me feeling very warm, but also crying. Splitting with the wife who I had been with for more than 10 years would be hella tough, but I had to be true to myself. Of course I was just high, and not in love, but it was very much the reality I was facing at the time. 


Like the last time I had run on LSD, the visual effects were greatly diminished. Things were fluid, wavy and non-solid, but it was very mild compared to what I would usually be seeing on this kind of dose. Could the tabs I had brought be under-dosed? Sure, you can’t really know how much you are getting, but the other effects were still going strong. The body was constantly tingling, and it felt like an electric current was going back and forth in my body powering me. Sometimes I felt light as a feather, and at other times I felt more like a brick. 

The path went mostly on trails through the woods. The area was very beautiful, and I thought about how lucky the people who lived on the farm I passed during the sunrise where. I wanted to live on a farm!

### Super Mario:

I was in a two man pack followed by a mustache-clad man in a red windbreaker jacket. I called him Mario, and he had followed me for some time now. If he knew how far out I was at the moment he wouldn’t be, but following the red stripes that showed the way made for easy navigation ever someone as high as I was. But when the red stripes disappeared, he acted as if it was my fault the we had gotten a bit lost. “Just brilliant!” he had exclaimed before he turned back. Luckily I could follow him on the way back to the trail, and we had only been a little bit off. 

He seemed to care about his time, unlike me. I only wanted to finish the race. But why? I wasn't sure. Why does anyone do anything?


### Doesn't taste like anything to me!

The halfway point was coming up, and I had already done the longest run of my life. Almost a marathon on LSD - not bad at all, I must say! While there had been moments of sluggishness, I had mostly felt very energetic since the drug had started to work its magic on me. I was no longer in love with ponytail girl, but we kept running into each other every now and then, and mustache man I assumed was far ahead of me. 

After a grueling hill me and ponygirl reached the aid station on top of a cliff, overlooking a cute little lake. A volunteer asked me if I wanted something to drink, and I said please. Talking was difficult with  my jaw clenching, and I had to resist a sudden urge to giggle. I noticed how weird her expression was: patches of skin on her face were twirling in spirals, and her large nose was growing and shrinking rapidly. Nothing in her face really made sense. I got a coffee from her and filled up on water, and sat down alone on a nice rock, from which I could see Mr. Mustache eat and talk with some other runners.  

There were snacks and food available here, but I went for the egg and avocado sandwhich I had brought with me. I hadn't eaten since last night, but I wasn't hungry at all. Which was for the best, because when I took a bite I couldn't feel taste. It was just texture of the food, which disgusted me. I spat out the mush, and the aid station coffee as well. Undrinkable. At least the day was nice, and as I sat down the hallucinations started to grow stronger. What looked like waves swept over the forest below, and the cliffs surrounding the lake moved up and down like whack-a-moles. Suddenly I felt as if I was in a bubble underwater, and the words b, fourteen, down came back to me. What did they mean?

As I heard ponytail girl crack and joke and others laugh at it, the bubble popped, and I was back, ready to hit the road. And despite having run 24 miles, longer than I had ever run before, I wasn’t really that tired. Is LSD a performance enhancer? I don't know, but it definitely is a pain and fatigue remover. 

###That time LSD made me gay. 

I could not move my gaze from his butt. The cheeks were like two bowling balls of pure muscle, sculpted by Michelangelo himself. They were firm, yet at the same time bouncy. How the hell would I tell my darling wife that I now liked men? Is this what LSD does to you - or was it the running? 

Whatever it was, I was now gay. What man wouldn't be, when looking at that fine piece of man-butt in front of me? 

### Old men, green particles, and the end of it all

I'm not gonna lie - that later half was tough. Real tough. I was coming down, the peak was gone, and I had been running as if it was my day job. Often walking too, I must say - no first time ultrarunner runs the entire distance on his first race. At times I questioned myself wondering why the hell I was doing this. Was I having fun? I was in pain. Especially during the asphalt sections that popped up every now and then. The lungs worked fine, but it was the constant pounding on the legs that was wearing me out. 

As I stopped to pee I felt as if I  was surrounded by green particles flying in the air. I could see them both with eyes open and closed, and it was very comforting. Many times during the few LSD trips I had undergone I had felt like there was someone watching over me, a force of some kind, and it was good. Even if it was my mind making up this feeling, it felt real enough.  

The green particles stayed with me for the much of the remainder of the race, and it did ease my pain somewhat. How the mind does that is strange, but that's what it did. I had a feeling that I would be experiencing this even if I hadn't taken any LSD earlier, but that was impossible to know.  Maybe this was the real runner's high that some athletes talk about? 

Someone who seemed to be in a lot of pain was the old man me and a group of four runners passed with only a few miles to go. He must've been sixty years old, and he was limping, and took a break to hold on to his knee when we reached him.  We had been out for shy of ten hours, and just now were we catching up to this dude who looked like he could have grown up grand-children. That was impressive. Who knew how long he had been limping out here? He told us it was ok to keep going, and that's what we did. As did he, slowly limping his way to the finish line. 

Ultramarathons are for most people not very comppetetive. It's about finishing, and for some people, it's about finishing while tripping on LSD. But as I and two other runners reached the road that would in only a few hundred yards lead to the finish line I noticed one of them picking up the speed behind me. Game on! his friend shouted ""I'm not doing this!"" but as long as there are two, ther there are enough people to tango. 

Soon we were on a racetrack, torches on both sides of it, and at the end was the finish line. It looked like the kind of place where tribes would sacrifice virgins to appease the ancient gods, and I could hear my wife shouting at me as I reached the bend that took me to the final stretch of the race. My lungs were screaming for air - we had been keeping a hard pace for at least half a mile, and now we were side by side with only one hundred meters to go. Not even  Usain Bolt would have been able to run past any of us then and there! The man next to me gave it all, but so did I - and a little more. I was faster than him, but we were both winners, both smiling just as much. I couldn't imagine a better way to finish my first ultramarathon.


### Post race thoughts:
 
I was proud of myself when I finished. I hadn't just finished a 50 mile ultramarathon in 10 hours and 23 minutes  - I had finished an almost year long project. Sure, I hadn't made the world a better place nor had I invented something cool, but I had stuck with something tough for the first time in my life. The LSD part had been really fun, and psychedelics had shown me another piece of the world I didn't know existed, but I think what I had learned was how rewarding it felt to.. do stuff. A friend who had hiked the Appalachian trail had talked about the sense of  purpose he had felt during that ordeal, and that was how I felt during this whole thing. And now what?

As me and the wife headed home in the car, I spotted the old man limping on the road leading up to the finish line. I was impressed with what I had accomplished, but this dude was built with stronger bricks than most. Why the hell would he keep going like that? Then I remembered one thought I had been having a few times over the race  - sometimes it is at your worst, you feel the best. 


What followed the next few days was pain. So much pain, especially during toilet visits. How anyone runs even longer events was hard to fathom. But despite this, it didn't take long for me to sign up for another ultramarathon, which I would do sober. And guess what? I twisted my knee and had to drop out. Perhaps a sign I shouldn’t be racing with a clear mind. 

More LSD adventures? A few, but no more more reckless run/trip combos. Last LSD trip was 2019. Some slight interest to redo this one day, but nothing serious.

I've been experiencing Patellar Tendinitis for about 5/6 months now. I've ran on and off (mostly trail runs) for the past 1.5 years but massively increased my training from Sept '20 onwards and most of it was road running. I started to feel knee pain and eventually went to a physio who told me to do a few things to strengthen my quads and glutes, he said to keep running. 

I then did a silly thing and ran the Yorkshire 3 peaks (40k) and afterward, my knee was fried. 

I didn't run again for weeks to let it heal and went to a physio who basically said id overdone it too quickly. 

I've been doing eccentric decline squats, progressing from two legs, to one leg, and now adding weight). 

I've been doing this religiously but I feel like I'm not making any progress. Most of the time when I perform the exercises it hurts, I get the odd day when it doesn't. The physio said to slowly start to run again as in for 5 mins, then 10, then 15.. which I did, but it got too sore again so I just stopped and decided I wanted to fully heal before I try and run again.

Obviously, I'm itching to get back to running BUT i want to heal.

Pace: 4:31min/km (7:15min/mi)
Elevation Gain/loss: 194m (636ft)

This was run consistently at 85-90% maxHR (estimate as I don't know my true MHR) at the end of week 15 of training, no taper or extra rest just did this as my long run. Big effort, had nothing left when finished.

Training to date:
Weeks 1 - 12 were base building up to ~70km (45mi) per week with almost no running done above an RPE of 6, last 3 weeks have been at ~80km (50mi) per week with 2x hill sprint sessions per week (12 x 1min max effort on 6 - 10% grade). Running done on a 50/50 split between road and trail, average about 10m per km in vert (about 50ft per mile) in elevation gain.

Plan is to do another 3 week block of hill sprints, then around 8 weeks of tempo running work, then 12 weeks of specific work for the race itself at lower intensity but higher mileage (peak 120km/80mi per wk).",1613998358

I am currently living in midwest (Michigan) and looking for the closest 1500+ ft continuous climb. I have been trying to use AllTrails, Gaia, Trail Running Project, etc. to find trails with a lot of climb, but it only allows me to filter based on mileage and elevation gain independently. This has caused me to miss some potential trails. Is there something out there that can allow me to find feet climbed/mile for a trail? (Or does anyone know of big climbs near MI?!

I was aiming for a sub 4 performance and had a solid training block until I got hurt during a long run and then got hit with some bug (not THE big) that put me out for a few weeks. At this point I’m showing up just to compete but I’m expecting to get passed and probably not even PR. It’s also not helping that I’m averaging 2 hours of sleep a night with a cranky toddler.

ultrarunning,datastand,Medical certificate for race entry,"I'm entered into the PDA, support race to the Val D'Aran by UTMB race in Spain this summer. As part of the entry I have to submit a ""medical certificate"" to show i'm able to run this race. The deadline to submit this is over 2 months away. 

I emailed my local GP/Doctors practice (i'm UK based), thanked them for their hard work with the current situation and making sure older ones/my parents are getting vaccination appointments etc, and explained that i didn't want to appear as selfish (given the current priorities) but i simply wanted to enquire about the process of getting the medical certificate completed because it was something i've not had to do before.

An email reply arrived within an hour saying that if i emailed back proof of id, the form would be completed and upon payment of a fee it would be emailed back. For reference the form is here, https://www.aranbyutmb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Certificado-medico-ENG-2021-1.pdf and needs only the doctors name, date of birth, stamp and signature &amp; date.

I had (wrongly) assumed there would be some form of in-person verification at the very least to see that i appeared capable of running the race (virtual perhaps given the current circumstances?!). This turned out to not be the case and i was taken aback by the fee they were going to charge for the ""work"" of filling in the form.   

I asked about the reason behind this, to which the response was:

""I’m sorry but that is our standard fee for a short report. 

When a GP puts their signature to a document, this is confirming that in their clinical view the person and the facts are sound.  This carries a risk but their professional training and expertise enable them to undertake the work.  As this work is outside the core GP work, a charge has to be made for their time and expertise.""

To which i replied:

""Thanks for clarifying, i appreciate the legal aspect of signing a document and the professional and reputation risk that this subsequently brings. 

I think on reflection i had initially expected at least some form of in-person verification but as it sounded like it was just a case of having a form filled in and emailed back on receipt of payment it struck me by surprise. If that is the case, how much ""professional training and expertise"" comes into it? And how can i be ""clinically viewed as sound""?  

I am genuinely intrigued by this (it's the first time i've had to sort anything like this out), sorry if my initial assumptions were incorrect :) 

Am i correct in understanding there is no in-person verification, but i can send proof of id via email and then payment when asked for and the form is just email back?""

I've had no response from this, so at this point i have a couple of thoughts;

1. The 'fee' is justified by the doctors ""professional training and expertise"" but the reality is it is filling in 4 lines of a form!! This doesn't seem to make sense.

2. What is the point of a 'medical certificate' for the organisers if it's just a case that a doctors surgery can sign and stamp it and then send it away, with zero actual verification. Is it purely for insurance/other purposes?! 

If it is just a case of getting a form signed, i'll look for a more sensibly priced 'service', but again it seems to defeat the point of it. Or is it my GP/doctors surgery and how they're reacting to it? Or, if Val D'Aran actually want a genuine medical check i'm more than happy to pay for it. Something just doesn't seem to add up at the moment. Or, lastly, is it a Covid specific case and it was different before? Has anyone had any similar concerns/questions or any sensible solution or advice please? Appreciate your thoughts :)",1613864132

At the moment I’ve sort of taken a few weeks off from training for a 50 miler, work is nuts at the moment, I’m TOTALLY exhausted all the time and end up skipping recovery to keep training which just has a negative impact, and I’m also mentally wondering if the race in May will even happen due to covid. I’ve been running the same trails due to time constraints and also alone, so that hasn’t helped. In any case...

I'm racing the Tushar 100k then Run Rabbit Run both later this year. I live in the Midwest and wanted to get out of town for a few days and get some miles in at altitude. Partially for fun, other part training.  

I'm looking at late May/early June. I'm torn between two options and having never done anything like this before - looking for some honest feedback. 

Option 1: Westen States Training Camp
Its easy in that I dont really have to plan or cover any logistics. The canyon temperatures will hopefully give me some exposure to the Tushars race, that one can get pretty hot too (not triple digits but lots oft time in the sun). It has built in aid stations. Obviously lots of other runners there and people to connect with. I'm naturally shy so not sure how this would go. 

Option 2: DIY Adventure in New Mexico 
Its be similar to Option 1, three days of training. I have day one sorted - [Mt. Baldy 50k Course](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/), higher elevation and gain than Leadville 50 apparently. Would be pretty hard in that respect so maybe more training benefit? I'd likely be self supported so it'd be all on me. Day 2 [Wheeler Peak Traverse](https://youtu.be/uLjrjtb1QUs), shorter route but some nice gains and views. Again alone. I'd have to sort out a third day but I'm sure I could find something. 

I think both trainings will be good mentally, just actually getting up and over some mountains. I can do hill repeats here all day but its obviously not the same. 

Curious if anyone has any experience either with Western States Training Camp or doing tour own adventure. Im sure im missing some big points too so please point out what you see.

Was supposed to be a nice 30 degree day but instead we were greeted with 13 degree temps, 2-5 degree wind chill, and snow. But, i dont account much for the weather since everyone has to deal with it. Doesn’t suck more for me than anyone else. 

What I didn’t account for was my lack of trail miles leading to the race. I’ve probably run 100 miles on trails since the start of December but nothing as technical as what I was gifted today. 

After 2 laps, my ankles, quads, and hamstrings had enough. I was slowed to a crawl. The way I felt, I knew if I started another 13 mile lap it would probably be an average of 20 mins or more per mile. With my wife manning my aid station in these crazy conditions, I just couldn’t do that to her and my body didn’t feel like it could take much more.

I graciously bowed out at the marathon mark.

It’s only divided into 4 laps: loop 1, aid station, loop 2, aid station, then stopped. 

It was tough. Before attempting 50 miles again, I will certainly train accordingly with lots more trail miles. 

Win for the day: my first loop was 10 minutes faster than 2020 when I only ran the half marathon. Relaxed effort in 2021 was faster than full effort 2020. Fitness is better. But not good enough.",1613256156

Typically when winter hits, I cut back on running and focus on snow sports but this year, I decided to go for a 100-miler in early May (it’ll be my second). So in my mileage build-up, I’m spending a lot of time running slowly in 10-20 degree F temps. 

Cold weather doesn’t bother me except I am thinking about food A LOT during my long runs, which I never do in warmer temps. Today I was dreaming about pancakes almost against my will. I fuel every 45 mins or so but it never feels like enough. And I am starving for the rest of the day, despite eating amply. I’ve actually gained a few pounds (but I usually do in winter anyway).

This hunger would make sense if I was shivering and freezing for 3 hours, but of course I warm up after 2 miles and feel quite comfortable for the majority of the time. Most of the articles I’ve read seem to confirm that if you’re warm, you’re not burning extra calories just by running in the cold.

Nothing new to see here - one year later and races that I had planned for April and May of 2020 were rolled over to 2021, and look like they might not/probably won't happen (Lake Sonoma 50, and Miwok) yet again. No final decisions have been made but based on the fact that these races are 2-3 months away or less, and have yet to receive their permits, it's not looking good.

I love ultrarunners, I love meeting people in trails and at races and learning about what fuels them and their background; mostly because you can relate to each other because there really is a special kind of crazy to people who willingly run for upwards of 10 hours of a time. There is something genuine about that, which drives me crazy with how staged these running influencers are. Like setting the phone down to make a video of you running by? Come on man. There’s nothing wrong with posting a run or race you’re proud of, but spare me the Soap box about how hard it was for you and how tough you are and how EggWeights make you strong and faster",1613075278

ultrarunning,aParkedCarr,"Running 2 races in one day for a total of 45 miles, what should I do to prepare","Looking for advice on how to prepare for my first ultra/how to use my time before my second race. I am planning on running 2 Spartan races in the beginning of June of this year in Fayetteville, NC. To those that are unfamiliar, Spartan races are basically trail races with a bunch of physical obstacles thrown in through out the race. 

The first race would be at 6:00AM and is going to be roughly 30ish miles (split in 2 15 mile ""laps"") and then at 2:30PM I would be running a half marathon roughly. This would be all on trails/unpaved course. Total would be any where from 40 to 45 miles. Elevation is unsure but I have race up ski slopes like Killington, VT before so that won't be an issue per say.

I have run one marathon before and there isn't anything wrong with walking/hiking for parts that I need to. I have long runs up to 10 miles this winter and don't know what I should aim for in terms of training with technically 2 races in one day. On top of that I am aiming to have hopefully a 1-2 hours between races to rest/eat. What would be important to do during that in-between time?",1613056208
ultrarunning,lohord_sfw,A question about Coros watch training and performance metrics,"To all Coros users:

Garmin has an entire page on how their Performance or Training metrics are derived: https://discover.garmin.com/en-US/performance-data/running/#physiological-measurements. 

For example it talks about how its recovery time takes into account stress and sleep data. 

I understand that Coros might be doing it in-house (instead of using FirstBeat like Garmin does) but I can’t seem to find much information on their metrics like how AI Trainer works, Training Load or how their anaerobic and aerobic TE values are derived. Are their Threshold HR and Pace values true?

In general, are the values given by Coros reliable? 

I understand that Coros is trying to appeal to serious athletes so it’s kinda weird that information like these are not readily available.

A lot of doctors and specialists I'm seeing don't have a running background. I am a firefighter so running is legitimately a part of my job, not just a hobby. 

So anyways, I have 4 bulging discs in my lumbar area (low back). Occasionally I get numbness (Sciatica) to my hands and feet. This occurred early last summer, but from Aug to Dec it was fine. I was training like I normally did. Then it started flaring up again in January to now. The weird thing is that I don't feel much of anything in my lower back. I get this weird aching feeling in the middle of my back. It's not really pain, but it makes me feel nauseous. I have notice that one of the things that triggers that feeling is running. Specifically long or fast runs. 

I took a couple weeks off and started slowly getting back into both weightlifting and running. Yesterday I went for a slow 4 mile run (in snow) and now I'm kinda getting that nauseous feeling again. This is incredibly frustrating. Every time I think I'm healed it comes back. I've literally had to turn down jobs because of this.

- fruit leathers / granola bars from Costco:  this is sufficient to get me through 2hrs at easy efforr but haven't tried anything longer on this fuel;

We all know the shape of the archetypal ultra running athlete: wire-y frame, spindly legs, chiselled good looks, usually white (but please  let’s not get into that now...) 

But we don’t all look like that! We come in all shapes and sizes, praise be, but I’m particularly looking for some wisdom about running far with big legs. 

I’m not a chubby guy; I’m pretty slim up top but I have big tree trunk legs. How does this effect my performance? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? Will this limit my potential distance? Will this increase my risk of injury? 

I’d love some anecdotal responses and I’d love to know if there is any literature on this. 

My experience so far is that my big legs seem to give me an advantage of steep technical descents, I’m stable and quick. But do they slow me down going uphill? I’m certainly not very fast on the flat. I would suspect that I generate a lot of power but that it mainly gets spent trying to drag these long limbs along.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be running my first ""last man standing"" event at the beginning of april. Due to corona it's a virtual event so you do it at home and have to do 6.7 km (4.16 miles) every hour and you have to start at the beginning of every hour. Due to the curfew the event takes place from 5a.m. till 23.59.

Tips that were given on similar threads on this subreddit were:

- Don't overdo the carbs, also eat a lot of fats: almond/peanut butter, avocado, eggs....  
- Use something against chafing  
- Use tailwind as a drink  
- use enough variation for food and eat real food, no gels  
- start eating the last 10-15' of every lap  
- Never give up during your break at home whether or not you'll think you'll finish your next lap  
- pace: 45-55' per lap  
- during the resting phase: keep yourself busy, stretch, text some friends, eat, ...  
- Tell your crew what they need to prepare for the next time you finish your lap  
- 0.5 liter drinks/200-300 cals every hour

ultrarunning,DistantDaikon,Tip for the Mental Side of Things: Turn Off Auto-Lap,"I could be behind the ball on this one, and if so, I figured it could be good for people to give other mental tricks that help. My watch had an auto-lap function where it would beep every mile. I'm sure most people know what I am talking about. Never really thought much of it. However, I realized I was always keeping track of what mile I was at based on the beeps, even if I wasn't consciously tracking it. 

This would lead to me deciding after a certain amount of beeps (miles), the run was suddenly hard and I would mentally deteriorate. I recently turned off my auto-lap and just run by feel, and I found that I was much more in-tune with when I was genuinely getting fatigued vs. convincing myself I was fatigued and after X amount of miles.

If I want to know my current pace or anything, I simply hit the lap button, wait 20 seconds, check the pace, and keep moving. This has helped a ton mentally, as I no longer have a mental cue of when it is ""supposed"" to be hard. I just go only by how my legs feel. It has made long runs much more enjoyable.

Looking at the graphs the Suunto seems to be tracking more frequently, so I guess it could be just more precision on the little ups and down, but even on a km where both watches register 0m descent, the Suunto is giving a great ascent figure. I had previously assumed my Garmin to be generally correct as in a race I did it gave the exact same elevation number at the end of the race as the organizers had advertised.

I eat enough to maintain my weight. I sleep 8 hrs a night. 

I work as a mountain guide and mountain rescue so I ski and (somewhat mildly) hike for work full time. It's not 40 hours of moving but it's enough my legs are tired at the end of the day. 

Couple that with running and the past couple weeks my legs have been super tired, all the time. So I took a full week off of running and built back up, but I'm at the same spot. Every run they are tired, every day at work they're tired. At night I have to sleep with compression shorts or I'll wake up from the aching. 

Am I building too aggressively? I only started running in October (at 15mpw) Should I maintain at 30-35 for a while? Should I push through? It doesn't actually bother me, I just don't want to be wasting my time

ultrarunning,Dunwoody11,50 Miler in late April off of current 30mpw?,"Hi all. I'm new here. Sorry in advance if I'm asking obvious or thoroughly covered questions. I looked for a FAQ but didn't find one.

I'm looking at signing up for a late April 50. Fairly flat rails-to-trails situation (the Frisco Highline, for those who may know it) I was set to run a similar one back in October that I had trained for thoroughly, but it cancelled due to COVID. My training dropped off significantly after that, so my longest run to date is a 50K back in August and my mpw is way down.

As mentioned, I've been humming along at a paltry 30mpw, a lot of which has been on the treadmill since December. I did a trail marathon last month that was pretty technical and hilly. It left me feeling wretchedly undertrained but since the course conditions were so different I don't want to read too much into it (but maybe I should?!).

So what do you think? Feasible? If so, I welcome any training suggestions. I figure getting myself up to 50mpw stat is essential but I'm not sure I'll have time to get the 60mpw block I have heard is pretty key as a minimum.

Time's not really a factor here. It's a 12-hour cutoff on a flat course and finishing before the cutoff would be my only real goal.

ultrarunning,mpetty,Yet Another Training Plan for Your Critique,"Hello, I'm getting ready to go for an FKT in October. I earned the [first FKT doing the out-and-back on the Buffalo River Trail](https://www.reddit.com/r/trailrunning/comments/drm0nt/trip_report_out_back_on_the_buffalo_river_trail/), but I did it like a lazy fastpacker and slept twice (prerogative of the first to the set the record, I guess). I'm ready to go back to try to do it in one push.

I'd be thrilled if some of you were willing to look over my [training plan](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xv89asxroqdoaw/2020-training.pdf?dl=0) and offer insight or critique.

**Course info:**

* Buffalo River Trail, out-and-back, northern Arkansas.
* Distance: 76 miles (122k)
* Vert: 16000 ft of gain/loss by route mapping (13000 by my previous GPS track)
* Surface: technical single track, rooty and rocky with occasional smooth hardpack.
* Main goal: &lt;23 hrs. Stretch goal: 20 hrs.
   * My moving-time was a little over 24 hours in 2019 (and my elapsed time was twice that). The new FKT-to-beat is 23h18m.

**Running history:**

* Started running August 2018. Lots of hiking before. 1300 miles in 2019 (including the FKT in October '19).
* 40-50mpw runner in 2019. 0-30mpw runner in 2020. 
* Running crashed in 2020. 750 miles.
* Some weekend adventure runs to kick off 2021 (12-20 miles, some off-trail).
* When I did the 2019 FKT, I completed it with an injury. I wasn't ready in 2019 but I did it anyway. I want to finish better this time and I feel that my base is a lot better even though in 2020 I ran a lot less.

**Plan overview:**

* Overall training goals are to improve my running base.
* 4-week cycles: base build, base build, vert build, recover.
* 150'/mile on base weeks, 220'+/mile on vert weeks, 100'/mile recovery weeks.
* Target: 60+mpw for 6-8 weeks prior to October, at least 6 weeks with 10,000'.
   * I would still feel I could complete the run if I have 8-12 weeks of 40+mpw with good training for vert and powerhiking.
* I'm really trying to train my base for sustained powerhiking up hills, so my primary target is vert based: at least one week with 14000'.

ultrarunning,rileyhemp,Altitude's effect on aerobic threshold,"I've been running for years but just recently got into reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and it's blowing my mind. 

Now instead of doing most of my runs in zones 3 and 4 I'm pulling it wayyyy back and trying to stay at or under my first aerobic threshold. For lack of a better way to test, I just try to breath through my nose when I run and that puts me right at around 145-150 bpm. 

This all seems well and good but it feels kind of high. I just moved from sea level to Colorado so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with how altitude effects this? The examples in the book put the AeT for people just starting this kind of training way lower like 130 to 135. 

I'm at around 8 min/mile at my LT which is around 160 bpm I think. But now am struggling to do even 12 minute miles without my heart rate shooting up to 155, which is where breathing through my nose is no longer an option for me.

It looks like the first 9-10 miles of the race would be on paved roads around Bald head island before you would transition to running on the beach for the remainder. 

I’m looking to run this race in over a year and a half as I have a marathon close to this years date and I would want to make sure I am fully prepped before taking on this adventure. 

My question is really a bunch of questions. 
How do you run on sand? I have very little experience with beach running and it seems like a one off kind of surface. Is there a trick to knowing what kind of sand is good for running? I’ve seen some people wear baggies on their feet. Is that something necessary and why? What kind of workout would you do to prepare yourself to run on that kind of surface?

And yet from what I read about him, he wasn't insanely fast in high school and college. His marathon PR is also 2:38 which is very impressive obviously but Jim Walmsley hit 2:15 which is leaps above.

Also, what is impressive to me is his height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). I don't know if this is a disadvantage or to what extent but it is definitely the case that most long-distance and ultra runners are a fair bit shorter than that.

ultrarunning,CBJ1834,Question about experience recovering from ultras,"I ran my first 50 miler this past November w ~11,000ft of gain. I took the next full week completely off, and then started running the subsequent week and ran 40mi/7,500ft + biked ~50mi (the plan was to run a 70miler in late Dec). 

That week I naturally felt pretty creaky and slow at first, but was feeling a little better/faster with each run (still slower than pre-50miler pace), and I felt really good/fresh mentally too. 

Then I just felt like I hit a brick wall halfway through the next week. I was still running almost a couple minutes per mile behind my normal pace and felt like no progress was being made. In the next 6 weeks I only did a few 6-8 mile runs, each a week or more apart, still at that same slower pace. 

Anyways I’ve been getting back into very slowly the past few weeks (14,18, then 20 miles the past 3 weeks), 90% of that at a very easy pace. I still feel so much slower than I used to and feel like progress is so slow. I had been running for about a year prior to the event but always have been active in other sports (basketball mainly) so I feel like I have a decent base.

ultrarunning,SoupatBreakfast,Views on shoes for 45 mile - 60 mile trail ultra Altra Lone Peak / Hoka Speedgoats,"Apologies as this is probably yet another ""which shoe is best"" post but wondering on experiences with the following: I've got 2 races coming up this year (Covid pending of course), both are on the South West Coast path in the UK (one is 45 miles, other is 100 km). Ideally I'd break in my shoes over the next few months and be able to get used to one pair for both events. 

The routes have rocky/narrow trails and lots of undulation. Last summer I ran most of the route in training in my inov8 Parkclaws (stocked up on previous years' model as the fit is so good). These were actually pretty good for me despite their mixed use. These are close to dying and so I've tried both Inov8 Roclite 275s and Trailrocs - neither of which seem to fit and give me foot pain in my insteps no matter what. They are also quite narrow. I'm looking at Altra Lone Peaks (due to the wide toe box) or Hokas - probably Speedgoats in wide fit. 

Aware both are solid options but I can see cons in both unfortunately. I think need to swap brands now as the fit just isn't working any more with inov8 trail shoes. The potential issue with Altra is that the fit is a bit hit or miss (and tricky due to lack of open shops at the moment to try on) and with Hokas I've read that they are so high up that you can feel disconnected to the trail and perhaps not as nimble, plus the fact that grip isn't amazing on wet rocks. 

My other option is to just get some parkclaws again, but aware they aren't ideal for the job, plus from experience lack a lot of toe protection - I stubbed my toe on two consecutive days which hurt like hell.

I’m definitely a mid-pack runner but am fiercely competitive with myself and want to improve.

My question is this: what is the one, or the handful of things you added to your training toolbox to improve your endurance and overall athleticism as an ultra trail runner? Getting a coach? More strength training? Logging longer mileage/hours per week? Eating more? Hill sprints? I’d love to know what made the most impact for you.

Not a little bit of blood...it was as it my urethra was the spout for a keg of dark red wine (think cabernet).    


Anyway, I have had this happen before (in September) following some hard consistent running.  The docs did some tests (having a camera inserted into your bladder via urethra is not a good time, in case you were wondering) and it turns out that I am anatomically normal (i.e. - no tumors or other weird and/or scary kidney/bladder things going on).  So my instinct is that this is a dehydration and possibly an electrolytes problem.  I sweat like and absolute beast, because it is hot during my runs and most of the runs are in direct sunlight.  I do drink 40 oz of huma electrolyte sport drink during my 10m daily run.  I havent been doing anything deliberate to replace electrolytes after the run...some days I eat more salty things than others...and I def drink ""a lot"" of water throughout the day...but just based on feel/thirst.  So my theory is that I have been at a net loss of fluid and electrolytes for days now and once that trend hits some critical point of dehydration...the next hard run is determined to cause some bloody violence inside my kidney/bladder system.  Here are my questions for you:  


1) Do you have another/better theory?  What is it?  
2) Have you struggled with running induced hematuria (peeing blood)?  What did you do to solve the issue?  
3) What do you think I should change up about hydration / electrolyte replacement either before/during/after my run

ultrarunning,Exotic_Ad_367,Advice for someone who wants to start?,"Hey all.

So I hate running. I run quite often, just a few kms but it's always easy for me (with regards to my endurance). The most I've ran is 21km, and I've done that 3 times. Mt endurance was absolutely, and usually I didn't have pains in my legs for more than a day after. 
At some point early last year I felt a niggle in my knee, and continued running anyway. I then had pain for months in both knee and ankle. One year later, the pain in my ankle is still present, but only when walking, not running, and not at all when I use my zero drop or barefoot shoes.

Anyway, just blabbering on here. Because of my ankle I feel almost like it'd be impossible for me to run a long distance without feeling it... I think it's some kind of trauma from being out of action for a couple months. I don't know how much of this ache in my ankle even really exists anymore, or what it is. 
My question to you guys, or questions... 

Have any of you also got some aches and pains or issues that could potentially stop you from running long distances, if you let them? I'm sure not everybody has a perfectly working body. If so, how have you overcome or do you overcome these hindrances? 

And do you have any advice to begin training for say, a 50km? Sure, I can probably already do 21km again without the training, but that's not the point. Where and how did you start? 

Finally, does anyone also do weight training? I'm about 4 months into trying to put on some muscle, and always hear that it's either running OR weightlifting. 

I really would like to achieve something incredible like you guys, but am just a bit hampered by fear and lack of knowledge at the moment. 

Really would appreciate advice!

They will be running 100km in Phoenix, Arizona in the new HOKA ONE ONE Carbon X2 and seeing how fast they can go in it. ​ 

Carla Molinaro, UK Female Ultra Runner, is going to see if she can break the British and European record as she takes on the 100km race with her teammates!

ultrarunning,Ainur95,24 race in the late August,"My main event this year is 24h race scheduled in the late August. It's my first race of this kind, I'm aiming on at least 200 km. Obviously anything above 200 km is a bonus considering lack of experience (220 is a wet dream).

I have 7 months ahead of me, and I'm really looking forward to it. My training is going pretty well right now, weekly mileage is about 112 km (70 miles) for the last couple of months. I'm still running only once a day, winter and snow/ice on the surface make my runs slow and careful. 

In order to achieve my goal, should I later include double days? Is 100 miles/w enough to knock on 200 km in 24h race? And what is my main obligation -- be consistent with my running is kinda obvious, should I extend my long runs to 6-8 h and run really easy, are tempo runs and longer intervals more important?

ultrarunning,bizbup,Wear Sunscreen,"[Wear sunscreen](https://gomilpitas.com/jokes/kurt-vonneguts-commencement-address/). No, [seriously](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kurt-vonnegut/), and I'm not kidding, [wear sunscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen).

Running last week was seriously interrupted by a dime/nickel sized removal of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from my upper forehead right by the usual hairline. I still have all my hair :). 

Cause--not wearing suncreen in my youth (aahhh, the 1970s, when smoking was unfortunately rampant and riding carefree in the back of a station en route to full fat ice cream was great fun). I previously had a BCC patch removed from my back neck/shoulder area right above the (running) shirt line. I've worn sunscreen for decades (and worn a hat for most of that time) but it takes decades to develop. Running all these miles, exposed to the sun, puts us at greater risk for sun damage and BCC.

Things happen as we get older, which includes various maladies. This is one of them but mostly easily preventable. [People of all colors can get BCC](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html)

I'll be fine as BCC is generally easily curable by the removal of the BCC area, but the discomfort and need to heal without pain, and without bleeding through the stitches to reduce scarring, meant complying with medical advice not to run last week and most of this week. BCC is the ""best version"" of skin cancer to get, but [there's worse like squamous cell and melanomas](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html).

The first BCC was found via a skin check by a dermatologist, which was generally recommended by my internist based on age. I had a list of areas of concern I brought to the doctor. Each of those weren't in fact anything. But the dermatologist said this patch right here on your neck/back, that's where I’m concerned. I said that's nothing, just some redness and I probably just irritated my skin with something. Obviously I was wrong and the doctor was correct--it was BCC. 
I would have NEVER thought to go to the doctor if I had saw that red patch on me or anyone else. Get regular skin checks.
The second one was noticeably strange, but then I didn't go to the dermatologist because of Covid. Then I did and it was BCC as I suspected.

So wear sunscreen now to avoid sun damage and making this post yourself decades from now. And, for long runs, I generally wear what I call a [French Foreign Legion hat](https://www.runningwarehouse.com/Headsweats_Protech_Hat/descpage-HPH.html) that you can get from anywhere (the link is just one example) because your neck and shoulders are also exposed.

Plus, you'll look fabulous from the absence of sun damage (though despite my middle aged but youthful looking appearance from decades of wearing sunscreen, I still got BCC).",1611011492
ultrarunning,yugats,Is my plan crazy?,"I'm in my late 40's and just got into running a few years ago. Before that I cycled quite a bit.

I'm currently training for another half this spring. 

However, instead of running that marathon in the fall, I'm thinking of training for a 50k in Sept. I'm eying two different races in the region, neither is mountainous, although both would have their own terrain challenges (one rocky, the other with quite steep hills). I've heard of plenty of people who ran their first trail ultra having never run a road marathon, but is this crazy?

My question is about what my food/energy intake should be on my long Z2 runs.  On one hand I know those runs are about getting your body to use more fat for energy, so that makes me want to try to eat less, or at least as little as possible during those to encourage this adaptation.  On the other hand, I hear lots about ""use those long runs to mimic your long race"", which usually means the equivalent of a gel every 20-45 minutes.  I also see the possible catastrophe of eating very minimally during long training runs, then forcing way more sugar in during the race and having major gut issues.

ultrarunning,EconomicRunner,100km training,"Hi all, 

I have a 100km race coming up in July in the UK, so close to 24 weeks out. I don’t have much ultra experience, only running a 47.5km race last October. Since then, I’ve been running 80-85km weekly over 5 days for roughly 2.5 months, the same mileage as my peak in 2020. It’s mostly been easy miles (incl. long runs) with one day of threshold per week. As I’ve just been building, I’m currently running to time rather than distance. The past couple of weeks I’ve introduced 12x ~1 minute hill reps in between easy miles during one of my weekly runs.

Looking towards the race, can anybody offer advice about how to structure training? Some general points I’d appreciate feedback on:

- I’m definitely planning to increase the long run mileage more specifically. I’m targeting a 55k race some 4/5 weeks prior that’ll probably serve as my peak week, and will increase/decrease long runs around this as appropriate.

- I currently run the day after my long run, and will probably increase the mileage here over time 

- I think I’d like to incorporate speed work, any tips on how and when? E.g. 1km/1mi repeats early in the plan or later?

- Following that, should I periodise this training at all? I think any more than 2 workouts per week is too much, so should I be thinking hill reps + threshold for 4 weeks, followed by intervals + threshold for 4 weeks, or maybe longer hill reps + threshold, etc

- Lastly, any other ideas for specific workouts and when to incorporate? I’m conscious that it’s hard to do any training at “race pace”. I like the idea of progression runs, for example, are these best used infrequently and early? Or closer to the race?",1610745566

ultrarunning,bama-runner,SCAR Preparation / 100 with little support,"Bit of background coming, with a TL;DR at the end. In the spring of 2019, I did the SCAR with a group of friends (SCAR is a backronym for Smoky Challenge Adventure Run, all of the AT in the Smokies). All in all, I/we learned a lot from the run that I hope to apply when I go back for round 2, which will hopefully happen in a few months. When we go back for round 2, however, we're adding an extra 30 miles at the end of the SCAR. On the plus side, we're getting some support at mile \~30, \~70 &amp; \~85 (if you're familiar with the course, that's Newfound Gap, Fontana Dam &amp; Stecoah Gap). For folks who've done 100-mile distances with little or no support, what's your strategy? I'll share some details on gear &amp; the course last time so you have a sense of where I'm coming from. 

We ran it from North to south, and we plan to do north-south again this round. We'd done the math on an anticipated pace matching a 24-hour finish, and we realized shortly after leaving Davenport Gap about 1:00p that was going to be a struggle. There was ice &amp; snow on the trail for the entirety of the first 30 miles, all the way to Newfound Gap, plus ice all the way up Clingman's Dome. We were moving about 20-minute miles in the snow during the day, and did OK until the sun went down. After dark, the temp dropped below freezing, and running became much more difficult, if not impossible. We slogged our way into Newfound Gap around 2:00a, and over Clingman's about 4:00am, at \~30 degrees F &amp; 30 MPH gusts of wind. Not fun. 

Terrain, trail condition, &amp; weather improved south of Clingman's Dome, and we made pretty good time while moving during the day. Water, however, slowed us down. We had 3 hand pump filters between the 7 of us, and filling up water bladders took \~an hour. Needless to say, we burned *a lot* of time filling up bottles. We eventually rolled into Fontana Dam about 9:00p that night, all but out of water and very tired.

Knowing all of that, I have a few things that I, plus the group, will do different. 

* Trade out  the hand pump for a Sawyer inline filter. I've been using the one I'll take for \~a year with no issues. Love it.
* Bring a better first-aid &amp; hygiene kit. No details needed. I learned a lesson. 
* Prep for a slow pace, and plan the early part of the run around when we want to summit Clingman's. For the full course, we're estimating \~40 hours.
* Bring lots of options for clothes. This didn't really bite me last run &amp; I'll basically recreate my kit from last run for this round.
* Carry fewer calories for the SCAR portion (picking up more at Fontana, or mile 72). I carried 10-12K calories with me last run for the 72 miles, and I had 2K+ in my bag when finished. Felt like wasted space.

What am I missing? For folks who've done (mostly or fully) unsupported ultras, lend me your wisdom! If you've done the SCAR specifically, any tactical guidance would be appreciated.

TL;DR - In a few months, I'm heading out with a group of friends to run the 72 miles of the AT in the Smokies, plus \~30 more to make a 102-miler adventure run. For folks who've run 100-milers with little support, what suggestions do you have? Gear, water sourcing, nutrition, pain management...? I'm confident in my training plan, but if you have a silver bullet to share, please don't hold it back!

ultrarunning,Full-Option6556,"Help with ""Knee"" Injury","Hello All,

I was wondering if I could poll the crowd here. I’ve had a “knee” issue off and on for the last 5 years. I’m a avid runner and my typical week is anywhere from 40-70 miles (although I’ve taken off the last few weeks in hopes to get this knee problem under control). I’ve run 9 marathons and my most recent run was a 50 mile ultra in October 2019. I was training for a 100 mile ultra when covid happened and have just been running for mental health lately with no race on the calendar.

I’ve struggled with patellofemoral pain syndrome for about the same period of time as my knee injury. With the PFPS, I can generally get it under control by doing some step ups, reverse lunges, clamshells, etc. If I stay focused on that regimen and follow it for several weeks with reduced mileage, the PFPS will be almost non-existent. The PFPS has never stopped me from running but always painful when going downstairs and issues like that. Unfortunately, the PFPS always seems to come back if I don’t do my exercises 4-5 times per week.

The other issue is this knee problem. It’s not exactly my knee but it is right on the side of it. I am posting two pictures where I am pointing to the irritation. This problem is more nagging than the PFPS because I don’t even know what the issue is. I’ve seen a couple PTs but no one has really been able to help me. The best way I can describe it is that it is a dull pain. I can through it and it has never been completely debilitating, but I am always worried it is going to get worse, which keeps me from training hard when this issue pops up.

I’ve noticed this knee pain can get really bad if I am squatting a lot (just body weight). Even if I am squatting down to help my 2 year old son with something for a couple minutes that can trigger it. And once it has been triggered, I have no idea how to make it go away. The other thing that irritates it is stretching my hamstring (as you’ll see in the picture). When this is flared up, the entire side of the knee can sometimes feel irritated, but it always is tender where I am touching. I’ve also noticed that it can be irritated when I am driving if my leg is pushed out towards the gas for a long time. It also can bother me if I set at my desk for a significant period of time.

Again, it is not a completely debilitating thing, but I have no idea what it is or how to treat it. Since 2016, I’ve had some significant periods of time where it was not bothering me. Basically, it did not bother me at all in 2019 while I was training for the 50 mile ultra.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what this could be and how I can go about treating it? Is this somehow related to the PFPS? If so, should the exercises for the PFPS address this issue? I’ll admit, I’m not a big fan of going to PTs as the ones I’ve seen all just want to tell me to run less. Thank you.

Finally, Al Arnold accomplished the first known solo trek in 1977 of 84 hours and sobbed with joy on the summit. These were the roots of the future Badwater Ultramarathon.

ultrarunning,NRoberts75RR,When to use a hydration vest rather than a handheld water bottle,"I have a Nathan 18oz handheld water bottle that works great and can hold plenty of nutrition and all but I’m currently training for a 50k (~31 miles). I’ve got plenty of time to experiment with different stuff on long runs so I’m open to any suggestions. Yesterday’s long run was my longest so far at 30km// 18.64 miles and 40 miles (~65km) for the week. I ran at 8:10 per mile pace so it was a 2 and a half hour run. The reason I’m considering using a vest rather than a handheld bottle is because over the course of that time, my arm started to get pretty tired from holding the water bottle. At around 2 hours, I had to switch arms but it was still pretty annoying and distracting. I’m wondering if any negatives of using a hydration vest would be more of an inconvenience or less of an inconvenience than my arm being annoyingly tired (which is the only downside I’ve ever experienced with a handheld water bottle). Feel free to suggest a completely different option or call me out for having weak arms or something- idc. Around what distance/ time do you usually opt for a vest rather than a handheld?

I'm also going to be more tired than usual. What should I do to mitigate?

In more detail: I'm 45m, looking to do my first mountain marathon/50k this spring. I've been building volume steadily since May, up to 250km/month. Usually doing a long run on Sundays (up to 32km), 15-18 on Saturdays, and three or four more runs of between 5-8km during the week.

But now I am going to be busy and physically exhausted at the weekends. The unprecedented snowfall we just had in Central Spain has done massive damage. I am going to have to cut down, cut up and burn off maybe 15-20 trees. Some of them are quite tricky, some of them are pretty big, most are on a hillside. I can't afford to get a company in to do it. My wife and some friends will help, sometimes, but I reckon it's basically going to mean at least 8-10 hours of hard physical work every weekend until March, plus the planning, buying equipment, fuel etc.

Don't want to go on for too long. Has anyone dealt with having to cut down training hours? Or any tips for motivating myself to get out of bed and run on a weekend morning knowing that I have to then spend several hours as a lumberjack?",1610284277

ultrarunning,letcha,"My first solo ultra, from Point Reyes to San Francisco","Hey all, I shared this in /r/norcalhiking and they suggested that some of y'all might be interested as well.

I ran my first solo ultra (50k) last weekend, from Point Reyes (Bolinas Ridge Trailhead) to San Francisco (via Golden Gate Bridge).

It was an incredible experience. Physically, it was the hardest route I've ever done, but the views were breathtaking the entire way and I was able to keep the negative self-talk at bay for a fairly smooth run overall. I've absolutely had a more difficult time finishing flat marathon courses in the past.

[I wrote about my experience here](https://johnvantine.com/solo-50k-when-2020-gives-you-lemons-run-an-ultramarathon/), but some quick highlights from the day:

The weather was beautiful. A little mud on the trail from recent rain left the ground with that perfect ""bounce"". It was cool in the shade and hot in the sun... and the trail had a great mix of both, with dense forest opening up to epic views of coastline.

I almost ran into a bobcat. Literally. I was looking down at my phone to queue up a song, and when I looked up he was right in front of me. I shouted a lot and waved my arms around like a lunatic to get him off the trail. If that's not crazy enough, this is my second bobcat trail sighting in this month!

The mental games were minimal. This stretch of trail is so awe-inspiringly beautiful that I had sufficient distraction from the temporary pain. I was so into the music and my surroundings that I was just loving the hell out of the experience.

Having my family waiting for me at a few stops along the way broke the run nicely, and gave me something to keep pushing for. They met me at miles 11 and 22 for water/fuel/inspiration.

They were also waiting for me at the north side of the Golden Gate, and my daughter rollerbladed across the bridge with me during an epic sunset. The timing was perfect.

All in all this was an epic running experience. 2020 has been all about finding that silver lining, and this race was one hell of a consolation prize!

ultrarunning,Astonish_Mint,Looking for Advice . First 80+ Miler.,"I have been looking at a loop route that goes around my city for at least 6 months.

At first I thought I created it then found out it already existed.

It is about 80-90 miles (I have a GPS track but it includes out and backs to do it in 8 day hikes at 100 miles).

Anyway I had been training to do this as an Ultra and started running 30 miles a week and added more till after 7 weeks I was doing 50 miles a week. It was too much and I got shingles. 

Its been almost 2 months now and I feel much better but I have a sore throat.

I want to get into FKT's. I have set one that I am very proud of but it is more of an OKT and only really impressive because most of the trail is unmarked and extremely steep at times. (110 miles  hours with 38,800 feet elevation gain in under 54 hours / *I brought a tent and slept 5 hours in the middle*). 

I really want to do this tomorrow but the most I have ran with out sleeping is only 65 miles on the above mentioned ""FKT"".

I come from a hiking background so I am use to hiking 30 miles a day consistently with 10,000 cumulative thru-hiking trail miles since 2012.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Anyway, what I wanted to ask is should I train more?

What training should I do? I am pretty slow but I can go for a long distance.

I would like to work on speed.

Would running on a track be helpful?

Any other advice would be really helpful, I don't have any running friends so I don't know where else to ask for advice.

I know that I should rest but I really want to do this and the timing is good (\~3 day weekend \~Big moon \~only down to 15 degrees at night with mild wind) .

ultrarunning,yoozernamed,Looking for beta testers for recovery/wellness app (+story),"Hey team, fresh off the heels of signing up for my first race for 2021 (anyone else here running Marji Gesick 100 with me??) I'm feeling excited and nervous to really ramp up training. 

I normally do a good job at putting my head down and suffering through training/racing, and not great at all of the other things like rolling/recovery/sleep. I am fortunate to have a few friends that are coaches &amp; physios and give me different series that I can do before &amp; after for range of motion work but normally need to have videos or some recording to remember all of the moves and in what sequence. 

I've decided to take my background in tech startups and build an app for myself (and maybe others) to guide users along a visual movement program that is displayed on their mobile phone focused on health range of motion and restorative poses that adapts to their needs. Think of a mix between stretching, RoM work, and bodyweight work. A key component of this will also be that the adaptation will include the ability to enter in how much time you have to commit to this activity and it will build the program to fit that time window. 

How the adaptation part works is a bit more complicated than I want to get right now, but I will say I'm pulling from my network of top notch coaches (working with average joes to pros) and some seriously intelligent fellow nerds in the tech world to produce something fun that should have some real power to it when finished. Of course I have loads of ideas on what would be fun long term, but baby steps.

**If anyone would like to sign up to be a beta tester I would sincerely appreciate the feedback and participation. Please DM me and I will get you on a list for the first release.** 

I love this community and cannot think of a better group to get input from. This is not my startup so I'm not married to the idea, rather want to test my hypothesis across a few groups. This is actually more intended for the folks trying to get off of the couch to build consistent fitness into their lives but I'm going to selfishly use the time to test the tool for my own needs and thought maybe y'all would enjoy too. Any comments, questions, input welcome. 

Thanks team! Adam",1609369755

At 37 years now, my left knee not only has pain during run but has a dull ache constantly. I used the pandemic time to stop running to see if it’d resolve but when I started back up a couple months ago, it’s just been worse.

Went to PCP to have it looked at, and she diagnosed as osgood from childhood. Had X-ray done to confirm nothing structural, and everything was clear.

ultrarunning,AHRocks187,Back to back long runs - how often and how long?,"Hey all,

Been reading this subreddit for several months but glad to finally be making my first post!
I'm currently 3 months into a 9 month training plan for my first 100 mile ultra - the South Downs Way 100 in June. I wrote the plan myself largely based on one I saw online. In summary it's split largely into 4 week cycles, with 3 week training blocks and then a recovery week. In weeks 1 and 3 of each block I do back to back long runs on the weekend - for example last week I did 24 miles on Friday and 12 miles on Saturday. I think I have a couple of weekends around 25/20 by the end, and I'm really enjoying these as a chance to practice race strategy. 

In contrast, I was lucky enough to receive a copy of Relentless Forward Progress for Christmas. I was very excited about it given how much I've seen it mentioned, but was surprised to see that in the 100 mile training plans, there aren't many true b2b long runs, especially on the 50 mile per week plan.

I'm going to stick with my current plan for now as it's working for me and I've mentally committed to it, but was curious to hear what your strategy of b2b runs is when training for long events?

Happy running!!",1609280049

ultrarunning,Li54,Nasal breathing?,"I listened to a podcast yesterday that made some fairly convincing arguments for nose breathing during exercise. Specifically

 * You get 20% more oxygen with a nose breath than a mouth breath
 * The slower rate of respiration allows more oxygen to get into the bloodstream / muscles 
 * You release more nitric oxide, which means muscles can get more oxygen, and you become less fatigued as a result (and also recover faster)

I’m suspicious, because I very rarely have run with nose breathing (usually only downhills and going slow / when I’m feeling good, and it’s not intentional). I can’t imagine doing interval training with nose breathing, but there are plenty of articles that advocate for it. 

Interested in everyone’s thoughts.

Currently, my training and form has been in a downward spiral. I just dodged a Achilles tendinitis bullet thankfully but the PT does not believe the injury was local. She seemed fairly concerned about overall stability and frankly was surprised that I was able to run with my current movement pattern. She did say that slow jogs were permissible and that cycling, skiing, strength training without compound movements, or walking were all preferable.

I do feel that taking a break for at least a few weeks to reset my movement patterns would be very beneficial. The only other extended break I have taken was following a stress fracture. In that case, it was not much of a choice to press pause. Currently, I am struggling to take a break but running feels terrible. 

TL;DR: Running form is trash per PT. To those of you who have chosen to take a break in training, how did you manage to do so? Was there any cross training which felt especially beneficial? Are thee any core routines which felt helpful?",1609013566

I like they idea of a fast/light shoe with a little bit of ground feel but also recognized that 100 miles is a long distance. I'm also not a minimal/sandal guy either if you're wondering.

ultrarunning,no_bad_pizza,Suunto 9 Baro vs Coros Apex,"

Hey everyone, I need a new GPS watch and I'm having a hard time picking one between the 9 Baro and the Coros Apex. I currently have an Ambit 3 Peak and I have nothing bad to say against it, but I'm looking into signin up for trail races in the 100-125 km range next year and i'm pretty sure battery life will be an issue for those with my current watch.

Aside from better battery life, and don't really need any new features that the Ambit 3 Peak doesn't have. I can get the 9 Baro for a cheaper price than the Coros because of the loyalty offer for Suunto users, but I keep reading negative posts and reviews about the watch that seems to indicate that it's not as reliable as the 3 Peak.

My main hesitation about the Coros Apex is that according to the specs of the watch, it's ""coldest working temperature"" is -10 Celcius/ 14F. I live In Canada and I run all year long, so that would obviously be an issue in the winter.

Any tip or comment about either watch would be helpful.

ultrarunning,TheOnlyCaveat,Should I test my 100k pace on a 50k training run? And when?,"Background: I have one ultra under my belt (and a handful of marathons). I did Lake Sonoma 50 miler in April 2019. Next year they are adding a 100k distance which I am all in for. For the 50, I didn’t have much of a time goal and I went way slower than I was capable of. I ran 10:26 but could have broken 10 no problem. 

For this race, I’d like to see what I can do as far as pushing for a time. I’m early in training but I’d like to ideally pull in under 12 hours, which is 1:30 min/mile faster than the 50 I ran. 

My question is, should I test/practice that pace on a long training run? Like a 30 miler? If so, at what point in training? 4 weeks out? 3?

I feel like there’s probably a huge benefit to putting in a long run at your desired race pace when you are a bit worn down (like near the end of a training cycle). Is this a good idea or is that pushing too hard and risking injury?

At that point I was trail running 10-20 MPW with zero back to back long runs or any type of structured training... it was all for fun. I also climb, cycle and ski tour in the few months leading up to it which is the reason why I wasn’t dedicating my self to running but I was still in decent shape.

I’d like to do a 50 miler this summer and want to implement structured training and give it a solid go after learning a few things last year.

ultrarunning,LaszloYtal,Running-around-the-world questions,"Hey everyone,  


I have some questions about run-around-the-world attempts. Guiness World Book of Records has not gotten back to me since months, so thought I'd give it a go here:  


a/ Ultimately, after quarantine lifts, I want to attempt to run a self-supported around-the-world-record in 300 days with a backpack (this means I'd be running 82 km per day). I've done months of research but have not found much official information on who the current record holder is? Is Kevin Carr's feat doing it in 621 days correct?

aII/ Which distance is considered an around-the-world-run? It seems to be somewhere along the lines of 18,000 miles / 26,000 km?  


b/ Is the difference in ""unsupported"" and ""self-supported"" relevant when running around the world? As I understand it, unsupported means you take all the food you'll need with you at the start. But this seems quite impossible when you're on the road for 300 days? xD It seems therefore sad that around-the-world-runners need to call themselves ""self-supported"", while you're basically going on a 300 day road race? It seems to me these distinctions are not really applicable outside the realm of competition?   


c/ Another thing is I want to try to do it without sponsors. The idea is to go on smaller running expeditions (minimum 60-80 km per day, minimum 1000 km per expedition) and make them visible in my YouTube vlog. Once I reach the point of sufficient monetization with YouTube, that'll be the point to execute my world run. So my last question is, did anyone ever do something similar without sponsors?  


d/ AFAIK I've seen most self-supported around-the-world-runners use carts to carry their gear around, has anyone ever tried it with a backpack?

ultrarunning,Mansfisa5,Training Tips for Altitude,"Looking for advice on preparing to run at altitude (7500-9500 ft) while living and training at sea level. I am signed up for the Bryce 100 in late May but I live on the coast of Georgia. There are zero hills where I live, and the highest point is 26ft above sea level. I’m certainly not expecting to “race” this event, but I would like to survive and ideally even finish. I have previously done a 50 miler at 4500’ and didn’t feel any altitude at all. I realize that’s substantially different than 7500’ - 9500’, just offering precious experience. Im specifically looking for:
A. Any training tips to prepare without actually traveling to mountains (not an option before the race)
B. Timing of arrival before the race. I’ve heard that one month is ideal, but I’m a 44 yr old family man and business owner, not an option. I could feasibly pull off a week before the event. Is that worth it? Or am I better off showing up the night before and minimizing time at altitude.

ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,Training for the downhills,"Two days after my second ever 30km run (first was two weeks ago) I went out thinking I'd do a recovery run, up and down my local hills, maybe 180-200m total climb. Nope! I ended up doing maybe 7km but all walking, as I was still very much feeling Sunday's run in my legs,  especially going downhill. So what to do to work on downhill endurance? I can only really get out to actual mountains maybe once a fortnight.

For context: 45M, 180cm, 92kg approx. Doing about 220km per month, mostly slow and easy with some tempo runs. Used to run 10ks and HMs, but I've got into the idea of running mountain ultras and have been training with that in mind since May. 

My local runs are quite hilly, where in a 10km run I'm probably doing 230+ vertical. I have built my long run up to 30k, and have done two at that distance. The first, two weeks ago was one-way, uphill, but mostly quite gentle slopes for a total of about 500m vert. This Sunday I did a loop that included two 300+ metre climbs, and of course their descents. I feel like the downhills were harder on my legs than the distance per se.

I'm training because I love being out in the hills all day and want to be able to run all over the mountains of Spain. I want to do an organised event this year if they are back to normal. Here the ranges generally go from around marathon distance, to around 60k, to around 80k, but with fairly serious uphills involved. The marathon-ish events I'm looking at have 2000-2700m vertical gain.",1608647215

Altra Escalante is mentioned as a road shoe that can be good on dirt roads, but most Reddit users say it is only good for shorter distances.

Since March this year I've started taking training seriously with the goal of and building mileage really slowly with mainly low heart rate training. 

I've followed the general rule of building for 3 weeks and cut back on the 4th week. However, I get to 30km per week and I'm fine but whenever I start increasing beyond that I start getting minor niggles here and there... With a history of injuries I've learnt it's always best to deal with them sooner rather than later and truly believe the saying ""it's better to take a week off now than a month or more later on"". 

After every run I have a stretching routine which takes about 10-15min to get through and I've started incorporating some strength training but don't really know what I'm doing...

I guess my questions are, what can I do to help me increase my mileage with minimal injuries? Should I be stretching more/less? What stretches should I be doing? Should I do more or less strength and what should I be doing? Should I be cross training?

My long runs are getting longer. I did 32k, 600m vert on Sunday, which is a new distance PR. I was tired at the end, but two days later I'm already thinking about doing it again. I went with a friend who'd also never done that distance, on a beautiful, varied route. We followed advice to take it really easy, took walk breaks, refueled and rehydrated and finished in four hours. 

I loved it. I think I could have gone both faster and further. I have a solid base of ten or twelve 20-26k runs over the previous five months, and I think the step up to 30k plus is fine. I'd like to go up to 35k and then marathon distance over the next couple or three months if possible.

However I have often seen advice NOT to run more than 2.5-3.5 hours very often. What does the hivemind think? stick to a time maximum and try to get faster? Cut out the walk breaks?

 - Socks x 3 + the pair I will start in
 - head lamp 
 - Vaseline for the feet if they get wet for blistering 
 - gloves 
 - gels/energy bars
 - ibuprofen/electrolyte tablets

I am not bringing any extra shoes as my other pair of trail shoes is too narrow for my toes and will just negatively affect me. As for my beginning gear and clothing, I will be wearing a base layer thermal compression long sleeve, a thermal long sleeve over it, and then I will have a rain shell/ wind shell (Montbell Versalite) over it to protect me from th elements. Other than that, I’m just going to have a pair of gloves, shorts (maybe some compression pants underneath), and a hat + buff combo that will cove my ears.

ultrarunning,bottomfishbananas,Issues with front of ankle after first ultra,"Hi!

I completed my first Ultra last Tuesday. 40 miles self supported and raised a decent amount for charity. It was hard as I expected but I've put in 1300 miles of training this year so I felt ready for it. It went well and I stuck to my plan and was sensible with pace etc.

The day after I felt pretty good. Even managed to get out and do 3 miles to get my legs moving but I haven't run since due to my ankle.

The only issue I have is the front of my right ankle. If you were to go from each ankle bone and draw a line to the front of my foot then that's where the issue is. Kinda toward to the bottom of my shin as oppose to on my actual foot. It got pretty uncomfortable in the last couple of miles of the run and then it was pretty sensitive on the 3 miles the day later.

I can't even get to see a physio currently as they're all booked up until next year but I want to get out training again. For now I'm stuck resting it but I'm wondering if anyone has had similar issues and could shed some light on it? I'd rather be sensible and let it heal instead of going out too early and causing myself further issues.  


To clarify. It's not on the top of my foot. I've seen a lot of things about laces being too tight but it's not the same issue. If I go out walking then it just feels a bit tired after a while. Like a dull ache more than anything and it gets a little uncomfortable at night when I'm trying to get to sleep.",1607370624

Does anyone have any hot tips on managing those aches during long ultras? I hate feeling like these low level aches are the thing that's slowing me down.

I completed a training marathon yesterday using a Salomon Active Skin 8 hydration vest. Overall it was a fun workout, but I was concerned that the soft flasks felt like they were freezing through my baselayer and against my chest. The temperature hovered at just below freezing most of the way,  but I'd hoped the vest's material would have prevented any discomfort. By the end of the run I had a couple of red marks on my chest where the cold had penetrated my jersey.

Has anyone got any novel solutions to this problem? Wondering whether the soft flasks could be wrapped in a thin material or gauze for even a little extra protection. Alternatively, whether dispensing with the soft flasks and going for a bladder might be the best move.

But the fun update - I ran a half trail marathon this weekend. Its a local race, I was waitlisted, and just decided to go for it. My pervious best on a trail with similar elevation was 2:27, so I made my goal 2:15. I ended up finishing at 2:09 (13.56 miles because trail race, duh!). I was pretty pumped,  this was the first time I ran anything with a time goal - usually I'm racing a new distance just to see if I can finish.

I am running my first 50 mile ultra on December 26th and peaked today with a 30 miler (longest I’ve ever ran). I’m not sure if this is the right answer, I was just going off some articles I’d read. I should be able to taper/recover properly over the next 3 weeks. 

I structured today’s run as a 7.5 out and back (15 total), twice. That way I could refill at my house before heading back out. 

Throughout the run I would eat half of a fuel source package (honey stinger waffle or chew, Gu, clif block chews) every 15 min, giving me about 120-150 calories every 30 minutes. At the halfway point, I ate a Complete Cookie and drank 16 oz. of drip drop ORS mix before heading back out for second leg. Admittedly, I should’ve eaten a more “real” food at the half way point. This worked pretty well and I felt pretty good (food intake-wise) until about 28 miles. I hit a point where it seemed like my body wouldn’t let me actually swallow any food/fuel.

I will be cutting as much sugar and processed food out of my diet as possible. This will be tough, I crave sugar a lot. Got a pair of running shoes and headed out this morning for a short run. Felt pretty decent. Heart started pounding after 1.5 miles, but finished without my feet being too sore. Stretched before and after. Going to head to target today and get some better running clothes. It was really cold this morning. Here we go!

**Backstory:** During COVID I became very sedentary. I didn't exercise much and ate a lot of sugar. I gained 25 pounds (5'10"" 190 lbs.) and started feeling very fatigued all the time. I decided it was time to make a change. Gaming is my main hobby. I used to backpack frequently, but with life and work I have been busier and it has been harder.

Originally I'm training for trail races, but my first race is in the May, still is long time until that 60k race.

Currently good part of my running is on the pavement, and the track nearby is also asphalted. To be honest, 12h is more appealing to me and I'm not worried about my fitness (at least to finish it), just about eventual injury from that repetitive type of track running, even with the changes of direction. 

As someone who once (two years ago) sustained ITB injury and was 11 months out, I would lie when I'd say that I'm not concerned about running in a circle. It's not the track running that got me injured back then, but I know they are notorious for concerning ITB problems. 

So -- let's say I would try 12h -- do I need to run at least 150 km (93 miles)/week before I even try that or my current mileage is all I need? Feel free to give advice or two about nutrition and pacing strategy or your experience with this kind of running.",1606825768

I am following a  [50m training plan](https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Free-50-mile-ultramarathon-training-plan-outline.png)

My issue is on the Saturday long runs due to the amount of vert the runs are starting to take a very long time. My last run was the Cutback week and I ran 14 miles with 3674 feet of elevation in just under 3 hours. I also felt like this was a decent pace for me probably a bit faster than my normal long run pace.

My issue is as I get up to the higher milages on the Saturday my runs are going to end up at 6-8 hours. This just seems like a very long time to run on a training day. I dont mind maxing up to this but doing it consistently for multiple weeks seems a bit much.

I am training for a 100k in July. The route is a out and back over 47km with 2500m of elevation, mountain and technical trail and then a 6km flat run.

The route has it all, long hills, technical parts, flats, mud long downhills, steep hills, step etc etc etc.

I see a big consensus to train on the same type of trail you will be running on. 

My question is, apart from it being very boring would it be optimal to do all my training on this trail? Should I do my easy runs on a section, my long runs along sections, my hill repeats on a hill on the trail and my fast runs along the trail etc etc

Normally I do as much as I can on the trail but obviously this gets boring and its also relatively far from the house.

ultrarunning,heyitsjub_,What are the 3-12 core principles of ultrarunning?,"Hey team,

I've started to learn more about ultrarunning (have run two now) and am wondering what people believe are the core principles.

The question comes about from John Reed's book, *Succeeding*, with the following quote: 

""When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don't. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.""

ultrarunning,JmBrkr,Looking for Virtual Events,"Hi! 

I'm looking for a Virtual 50k!

I've checked Ultrasignup and don't see too many on there. I've checked several other sites and am not seeing much, most of the search results I see from Google are events that have already happened. I feel like I'm being lazy and not digging deep enough, but I'm not seeing very many. The reason I'm asking you folks where to look is I keep hearing about virtual events AFTER the fact. I'm wondering if there is another platform that is more virtual event friendly.

Additional context, I'm a trail runner and I haven't been able to get out as much as I like. I feel like if I fork over some money to run the trails behind my house for the day, I'll feel obligated to get the miles in and will be able to get back into a training mindset.

I'd like something toward the end of Feb, but if all else fails I might just go for it on New Year's Day (I did see the Ultra Crazy New Year Run)

ultrarunning,Cigats,50k build help,"Hey everyone!

I'm a new runner. I just started this time last year. I could use some help getting a 50k under my belt. I've run a few trail half marathons and recently did a trail 30k at 10:30 pace. It felt really good, i was running with someone and we were talking/laughing most of the way. I usually hit over 40 mpw with 2500-4500 vert. I've built my weekly mileage slowly over the last year. 

The only big changes I've made lately is doing more trail work instead of road. I ran too much road before a half and went way slower than I wanted to. I was a slave to low HR training which I think has held my pace back a little bit. But to be fair i have also been injury free which is more important to me. Most of my training is easy pace, but varies on trails - walk if/when needed. I do one harder workout a week, a 6 mile out and back with 1400 ft of vert, I just try to PR that section each time. I count it as my tempo/hilk/workout run.

So that's my background. I'd like to run my first 50k next year and maybe do a few. I found this plan here: [Hal Higdon]( https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/).  This program is nice because there are local trail half and full marathons that will be on the program schedule assuming i start the first week of December. My big questions are as follows:

1. The program recommends running trail. Most of my long runs until the last two months were road. Too boring. Will I still get the same aerobic benefits staying with trail long runs. Pace/HR is less consistent hence why I ask. Should I try to do as much trails as I want?

2. Should I keep the pace runs to road for an honest assessment?

3. Again I'm new  - what else am I missing?",1606374153
ultrarunning,ultracrockett,Gordy Ainsleigh's famous run,"In 1974, the most famous story in American ultrarunning took place, when **Gordy Ainsleigh** ran on the Western States Trail, in the California Sierra, during a 100-mile horse race, **without** his horse. At first, his run went unnoticed, until several years later when it became the icon for the newly established Western States 100 and for mountain trail 100-milers in general. He has given himself the credit for inventing ultrarunning.

https://preview.redd.it/n2hoiouz3f161.jpg?width=1105&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a925d183d1281b44fe9adf33ddf9354d08b4d1

In this episode of the Ultrarunning History Podcast, the place in history for his run is examined, and put in its proper historic context. Yes, you were told he was the first to cover Western States on foot, but he was actually the 8th, and the sport of trail ultrarunning was not invented that year. 

Also, 53 other people covered the Western States Trail on foot about a week after Gordy’s famed 1974 run. This forgotten tale is also told.

I'm currently running in a pair of Saucony Guide ISO 2s (I need a stability shoe) that I picked up on a whim as they were on sale. I've absolutely loved them - zero blisters, zero niggles and amazing cushioning up to 20 miles so far.

ultrarunning,75North_,Morning Musing,"Awaking to the sharp, sudden noise of falling raindrops on the cap of my pick up truck, I roll over, stretch my arms out of my cozy sleeping bag and the cold air pierces my comfort.  I had worked late last night, some walk-ins had showed up last minute and still being an apprentice, both needing the money and to pay my dues to the shop, I stayed late to tattoo them. Then, I had driven here, to a rural parking lot just outside of the trail. I inflated my slightly less than full size mattress, placed it on the plywood topper I built to store all of my outdoor gear, crawled into my sleeping bag and fell asleep.

I could just go back to sleep. Hell, I could drive home and go to sleep in an actual bed heated by a furnace. All of this is voluntary. These thoughts are interrupted by my remembering that if I wanted to stay comfortable and not push myself, I’d sign up and complete (not competitively) my local 5k. 

Pulling my body fully out of my sleeping bag I completely undress in the cold, the sharp rain hitting my tattooed skin. I quickly as possible change into all the running gear I’ll need for a 3 hour excursion into the woods. I open up a little cabinet I’ve built in the plywood topper, selecting a pack, a handful of energy gels and a hydration bladder.

For the hills stuff I am usually only covering about 3km due to the nature of the hill I run. Its about 120m gain over 800m and I run it 4-5 times uphill. Laps take about 3:30 or so and then the downhill I walk it so this takes up about an hour and a bit.

Should I do this more times at a slow pace? pick a less steep hill? Run the up and the down and at a slower pace? 

Otherwise I know the plan isnt very tailored but I think I can fill in the gaps. Any other advice or stuff you notice id appreciate the help thanks.",1605643797

ultrarunning,whitlow_running,Imposter syndrome,Just finished my first 100 mile race this weekend. Decided to do it virtually instead of heading to the race due to COVID and finished in 29 hours and 27 minutes. What is funny to me is the fact that my brain still has not come to the conclusion that I actually completed the race and actually ran 100 miles consecutively in a little over a day’s time. This is the first time I’ve really felt completely “flat” after a race and even seeing pictures and videos of myself during the event it is kind of like “but wait....really?” Can anyone else relate?,1605574201
ultrarunning,wings85,Postponed Race - What's the best plan?,"I was originally planning on doing my first 50k the first weekend of December, but due to covid this has now been delayed to the end of Jan.

I was planning on doing it unsupported anyway and then do the real thing again end of January. So my strat would look like;

50k race
2-3 weeks recovery.
2 weeks @ around 80k a week.
2 weeks of tapering.

I just want to complete the race, no time in mind. So is it a bad idea to try and do two 50ks in the space of 6 weeks, or would this only matter if I was going for a specific time?",1605557626
ultrarunning,mattBLiTZ,Stupidly-long minimally-supported runs: stroller vs pack?,"This is a ridiculous question for 99%+ of us, but I figured this was still the best place to ask to satisfy my curiosity. I was reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and got to the section about Ricky Gates running across America (also featured in a popular video that was posted here a bit ago) and how he used a push-stroller to carry his stuff, especially in long unsupported stretches of desert with no water resupply. 

It got me wondering: at what point is pushing a stroller a better use of energy than carrying a pack? I started thinking the threshold might be pretty low, and that the only reason you don't hear more about it is that obviously very few of us are traveling long routes that are suitable for wheels while also carrying monster gear loads instead of having aid stations or a crew.

I'd be shocked but - does anyone here actually have personal experience with this style of ultrarunning? Super interesting niche, I suppose the ""cousin"" style of the sleds people drag during monster snowy routes in Antarctica and Alaska.",1605550431

ultrarunning,egoemt,Race report: Sweet go deep Ultramarathon,"Ran my first ultramarathon, thought I’d do a quick (actually, quite long) race report. Any advice from ultramarathoners for improvements in training and tactics welcomed - I was reasonably happy with how things turned out, but there’s a lot of room for improvement, and I'm very much a beginner at this kind of distance.

**Race**: Sweet go deep Ultramarathon in Deep Cove, British Columbia, Canada.  45 km, 8202 feet of ascent. The sweet go deep is held almost entirely on trails in the spectacular North Shore mountains above Vancouver, Canada. The trail surface is a mix of steep ascents and descents, technical terrain and fast, rolling groomed trails with approximately 2500m (8,000') of vertical change. In order to appeal to a wide range of experience levels and abilities, the course now offers 1 or 2 loops of 20km, and, since 2011, the popular 14K course option follows a ""lollipop"" route.

Due to Covid the race was started separately by all competitors and you just posted your time at the end to avoid groups etc. So it was also self supported.

**Experience**: Running for about 6 months.

**5k PR 18:52**

**10K PR 41:58**

Lots of weekly hilly runs (5km to 36km), Hill intervals, speed work on tracks and easy runs. Running about 4-6 times a week. 

Longest previous run about 36km with 1800m vert (training, not a race). No race experience.

**Training**: Started running about 6 months ago but went out way too hard. Done some long back to back days on weekend and knees were shot. Bought a bike to push through the training and hated it. realized I needed to calm it down a bit and get my conditioning up. So started to bring back the distance and lower the downhill running until my body could catch up. Just building up 10% per week. Also experimented with gels, nutrition etc 

**Objective**: Finish in 8 hours if not before it gets dark (9:30ish hours)

**Race**:

*KM 1-8*: Set off just after 7 with 1.5ltrs of concentrated gatorade (I have a habit of drinking too much and peeing every half hour), 100 grams of gummy worms and 2 cliff bars. Feeling good. Walking the uphills and running flats. Trying to keep the slow pace. forgot my gloves and as I ascend its getting cold, damn. Drinking some 1.5 concentrate gatorade and eating some gummy worms. First hour has passed and I am starting to see [Real Snow] (https://imgur.com/a/S6H4ik1) . 

*KM 8-10*: The big hill and its covered in snow, some parts a foot deep- I was absolutely not expecting this and the race usually isn't like this, early snowfall this season. I started at 7am as I wanted to finish before dark worse case scenario. This means I am the first person on the trail so there is no steps for me to walk in or tracks to follow the trail. I walk it and its incredibly hard. Every step the snow gives way and makes it really hard to continue on the uphill. The trail is impossible to see and I have to constantly check my phone for the GPX to make sure im on the track. 

I consider giving up at about 9km as i'm cold and my feet are feeling numb and I was not in the mood for a snow ultra. As i'm moving slowly I think this is a great time for my cliff bar, which unfortunately is rock solid due to the cold haha. I manage to gnaw some of it off and eat it. I finally reach the highest elevation and try to figure out where the trail turns left on the now covered MTB Trail.

*KM 10-12*: MTB trail with MTB features. I try to stay on the GPX and I am making slow progress, sometimes I can tell I am on the trail as I cross a jump, ramp or horizontal ladder for the MTBs, I Try to cross a downed log feature but slide on the snow coverage and fall off into the side. I make a mental note not to do any balancing acts on stuff with snow. Psychologically difficult, as I Have to route fine in the snow and sometimes the routes around the features are not ideal due to everyone using the features. Some sketchy parts and I end up off trail by a fair amount at a river crossing and just have to walk through it as the MTB crossing is very uphill. Very cold but I run perpendicular to the track and make it back. This is all downhill so I am able to run a little and slide into the snow. 

*KM 12-15*: - Two hours have passed as I reach KM 12 and this makes me way behind time, the snow has also exhausted me. The snow finally clears and its some downhills on MTB trails. This part is very fun as I can use the MTB features and I don't need to keep checking the GPX. Some of the features are sketchy but as I can now see the area around them I can pass easily. Starting to really enjoy it as I get into a rhythm I feel a bad need to pee. Pee and continue on, meet some MTBers using the trail but no issues. I eat some gummie worms and continue on. 

*KM 15-18*:  - ascent on MTB trails. lots of uphill for me to walk with some downhills in between, I try to sprint these and use the speed for the next uphill part , so I don't lose as much time as I might have otherwise. Run some sections,  I've slowed down a lot and am having to walk some of the downhill sections. I am way behind time and my legs feel really heavy. I make the calculations in my head and realize its going to be a longer run. 

*KM 18-24* Mainly downhill and some flats for now, This area I have run a lot so know it well. Keep constant pace and eat another cliff bar and some gummies as I go. Finish the first loop at 4 hours 24 minutes. 24 Minutes slower than I was hoping. It starts to rain heavily when I am in the car I am using as my only aid station. I consider giving up, I seen no tracks and only passed one runner with no runners passing me. I start to think maybe anyone sane didn't run the Ultra due to the snow and I might be the only person doing it. I am worried about reaching the snow and being too tired and possibly getting gassed up there. I had a few slips and close calls and I do not want to get injured up there and need to call SAR. 

I have only drank 400ml. Trying to only drink when thirsty means I may not have drank enough but at least I did not pee 5 times.
I decided i've done half of it and when I get to the snow I can assess up there. I drain the gatorade to 750ml and add some salt. Slam down a cliff bar and refill my vest with cliff bars and gummies. I dry my feet and change my socks. I also add my headlamp incase I will have to run as it gets dark. I run over to the toilet as i'm having bad gas and stomach pain. Have a quick poop and lots of gas and off I go.

*KM 24-32*: Feeling good but have a lot of gas.

*KM 32-35*: I reach the snow and decide to go through. Its much easier this time as I can put my feet in the tracks from before. This means the snow does not collapse and take all my energy away. I get through this section 23 minutes faster than last time. I also see someone else's tracks this time but they are going the opposite way (I briefly wonder if i'm running the race the wrong way lol) stomach bloated and uncomfortable feeling very gassy.

*KM 35-40*: Snow is much easier to progress through with my tracks, I also note not to go to low and off track this time and I see the MTB feature for crossing the river, its a thin downed log about 3 feet over the river with about a foot of snow covering it. I cross it attempting to balance and when i get to half way the snow gives way, My foot goes right and my head goes left. My body collides with the log between my left ribs and my hip and I then slide off into the water landing on my right hip and getting completely drenched. The water is very chilly so I make my way out of it ASAP but get tangled in branches at the sides and fall through the snow. 

Very pissed off I eventually manage to get out. Feeling very sorry for myself and with pain in both hips I keep running as otherwise i'm going to freeze. (this actually helped invigorate me lol) I run out of hydration at 37km drank 750 ml by this time when I had only drank 400 the whole time 1st loop. Having a lot of gas and stomach rumbling but feeling okay.

*KM 40-47.1*: Follow the same trails but somehow I feel fresher and am able to make through in a faster time than loop 1. Really feeling the hydration issues and have also eaten all my food. I think about asking some of the passing MTBers for 100ml of water but decide not to due to Covid.
 
I get down to about 45km and should be done due to the bad tracking on the other loop i realize I still have a few KM left and had been running too fast as I thought I was done soon. I really walk the uphills and try and run the flats but its hard. I eventually reach the final downhill to the finish and I am able to push through to the end. Finishing in just under 9 hours. 
 
**Result**: 8:56 for 47.12km and 2460m Elevation 

**Lessons**: 

More food and less concentrate gatorade. I only ate 1900 calories should have been around 2700 for this time.

Experience is important. I learned perseverance I wanted to give up at many of the times but the issues were not that big a deal. The okay get to this part and then quit if you want worked very well as once you make it you are generally feeling better. The top elevation being at KM 10/35 means once you are there you generally have to come down anyway so might as well continue. The loop works well as you know the route the second time but also makes it easy to quit halfway. I feel like there is waves of I want to quit followed by feeling great about an hour later so its important to push through.

I had no run most of the trails even without the snow, The trails were not flagged or anything for this race so this was not ideal. I could have been much faster and not used GPX as much if I knew generally what direction they went in or followed. I don't think its a good idea to race something you have not at least walked. I will definitely cover the trails before race day even if its not going to snow.
If i'm starting early as i'm slower ill probably be the first person on the trail and need to account for this.


I overpacked the hydration and food for the first loop (1.5ltr and 1200 calories) when I used a lot less than this I packed less for the second loop (750ml 800 calories) This was a bad idea and I should have packed at least 1ltr and 1200 calories as my usage was higher on the second loop. I thought I was overpacking but realistically I was not. 


The next Ultra I run id like to have already ran all the trails and also have it setup with aid stations and other runners to improve the experience.

I completed a half marathon training plan in the spring this year and have kept my weekly mileage towards the end of that plan since. Trying to keep myself half marathon fit so to speak. That’s about weeks 5 and 6 on the marathon plan.

I was thinking of starting there, but 13 weeks doesn’t seem like a lot of time to make the jump though. 

If I repeated the back end of the plan of longer weeks would that help or hinder my efforts?

Its a 45km trail consisting of a 16km loops with 3km out and back to start/finish area. The big one is it has 2500m elevation and some parts will have light snow cover.

I am just looking for some tips and advice on timing and other things that I may not have thought of.

**Myself:
**
Running about 6 months, no real background before. 

Longest run 6:09:21	36.53 km	1,885 m	(I could gave done more flat running but was 100% walking the uphills)

Last long run 3:57:28	28.92 km	1,200 m (Very comfortable could have done a lot more, power hiking the uphills and running downhills whole time)

Both of these were in similar conditions to the race. 

Questions.

1. How long should I plan for the race ? Im thinking 8 hours should be enough.
2. I will be using my car as an aid station and it will be at the start finish line, anything I should be conscious about due to this ?
2. I am thinking of starting at 7am as it gets dark at around 4pm here, is this too late? 
3. I have a very small bladder so need to pee every 30 minutes if drinking, due to this I do not drink water when running but instead  1 1/2 strength Gatorade any issues with this as the run gets longer? Should I take some water also?
4. I usually just eat a cliff bar every hour and swallow some gummy worms whole as nutrition? Should I include some real food ? (I have never eaten real food in training)
4. I have a 2ltr camelback I was planning on filling it fully and then adjusting the fill to required when I get back from the first loop, would this be too much weight for 23km 1200m vert? Should I plan to drink less.
5. Due to the snow I will be bringing a second pair of socks for dry feet for the return part, any other items I should bring?
6. I am thinking of just walking the uphills from the beginning to make sure I finish, Is this a good idea or should I reduce speed on the flats and downhills and powerhike the uphills to conserve myself ?

ultrarunning,still_linky,Am I ready to do 100km?,"Hi, Community 😀

The breakless freight train of shit that has been 2020 has yielded some surprisingly good results on the running front. 

When UTA50 (Ultra Trail Australia, 50km) was cancelled I wallowed in self-pity for a week then pulled my finger out and committed to a run streak: 4km (2.5mi) every day, focus on vert, maintain weekend long runs. Touch wood, I'm injury-free, recovering quicker, able to eat lots on the run (medium cheeseburger meals 🤤) and much more in-tune with the bod than last year. I have grossly exceeded my yearly vert/mileage totals of years prior. I'm not race fit but feel I have a great base. 

Currently I run 7 days, about 55km/week with ~1200m vert and 1 dedicated longy of 25-30km each week. I prefer trails, and have access to them, but spent more time on roads this year due to it being winter. I have no structured plan other than this but have capacity to be way more purposeful. I feel I could go longer on the long runs, and in overall weekly mileage, but am mindful of ramping up too quick and undoing all the work (which has happened before). 

As for distance, I did a 50km flattish road run pretty easily this year but have not run further than this since 2005.

My Q is: how will I know if I'm ready for UTA100 which is in May 2021 and is 100km (62mi) long, 4400m (14500 feet) in vert?

ultrarunning,34kj234jkfdsm32klj,I got injured and took two weeks off. The 50k is Saturday. Would it be dumb to race it?,"I have a 50k, my first 50k, on Saturday. But two weeks ago I decided I wouldn't run it. Over the course of the fall, I've twisted my ankle several times. It happened again about 2.5 weeks ago. It hurt and I knew I had to take time off because it was swollen and immobile. I'm not sure it's the worst twisted ankle of the last six months but that just speaks to how many times I've injured this same right ankle.

I had been training for a few months and keeping up with it before this injury. I took 2 weeks off. This week I finally started running again. It felt pretty garbage the first couple of times but today I ran five miles in the rain on the road and felt good. Five miles on the road and 50k on the trail are two different beasts. A part of me wants to run because I trained for it, this was the goal. But another part of me is worried about this bad period -- injury, no running, way off my training plan -- putting me at higher risk for DNF or, much worse, serious injury.

I'm not sure how to think this decision through. The only other thing I can think to mention is about the injury. In the last six months, I've twisted my ankle a handful of times mostly on slippery trails either due to protruding roots or slippery leaves (and maybe hidden roots too then, I don't know). The 50k this Saturday is on a trail with lots of both. It's not technical in the way I see most people talk about it but the race directors do warn about the factors I mentioned because people do make missteps. Given my history, the risk is particularly acute.

I do, however, also plan to bring a small thermos of a warm liquid (I’m still debating coffee or alcohol free glüwein (spelling‽)) - hence this post. 

I’m looking for a insulated flask/thermos that could carry 0.35-0.5 litres of hot liquid and keep it warm for at least six hours in a temperature that could range between +5 and -10 (it’s impossible to predict, and the weather 2020 has been like the year in general...). Since I’ll be running with the flask the entire time I want it to be as lightweight as possible. 

Does anyone here have any suggestions on what to buy?",1604958629

ultrarunning,Balletfingers,Most serious hip strengthening routine?,"One of my glute medius muscles is very weak. Upon examination I could easily resist the doctor with my left leg laterally, but all my might could not resist the lightest push with my right leg. When I run I struggle to not let that hip sway out and cause a crossover gait, which in turn has begun posterior tibialis tendinopathy

I do single leg work 3x/week, but haven't seen much hip progress. I also tried doing myrtl before and after every run, which felt nice but wasn't quite the kick in the pants 

I've started adding 3x per week, 5 sets of progressively overloaded banded clamshells, which has been MUCH more helpful than single leg squats/lunges.

I love running in cool weather the best.  But there isn't a lot of cool weather in Puerto Rico and the heat is killing my speed and endurance.  

I am about 6ft and 200 lbs (not the smallest runner). Typically I run 6-7 miles daily, with about 600 ft climb at about 8:30 pace.  I have been slowly building up my daily mileage...trying to get to 10 miles daily.  

This week my body has been running out of energy after about 3-4 miles in the sun.  The heat is making me slow. My legs start feeling heavy pretty fast...and the heat and humidity is just crushing me.  Today I went out for a 3 mile run...and I seemed to manage an 8:30 min pace (pretty normal) despite the heat.  But I doubt I could have maintained it for another 1-2 miles. 

My assumption is that my body will adapt to the heat/humidity and eventually I will ""get used to it"" and my mileage will climb back up.

And by subjective, I mean the weather and my performance during the race factor heavily into where the race lands on the list.  I'm happy to have done all these races and would recommend all of them to anyone looking to challenge themselves at the distance.

 

1. **Eastern States** \- A beautiful and hard course, which broke me physically and mentally. . . and yet I was still able to finish.  I now go back every year to relive that accomplishment.
2. **Old Dominion** \- Really 1a instead of #2.  I love the course profile (trails, roads) and the old school feel of the race.  I experienced my highest highs and lowest lows here and got my buckle by 15 minutes (only given to sub-24 hour finishers).  I need to get back.
3. **Oil Creek** \- You never forget your first.
4. **Olde 96er** \- What's harder than running 100 miles?  Running 100 miles with no aid stations, crew, or support of any kind.  Probably my best executed race outside going off course for a couple miles.
5. **MMT** \- Very hot the year I ran and the last hill is just ridiculous.  
6. **Pine Creek** \- How is my 100 mile PR this far down the list?!?!?!
7. **NJ Ultra Fest** \- While the course may be a little generic, this was one of my better executed races.
8. **Cloudsplitter** \- Pretty course.
9. **Umstead** \- Poor weather the year I ran, but one of my better performances.
10. **Bighorn** \- This would be a top 3 race if I hadn't DNFed at the turnaround.  Stupid altitude.
11. **Burning River** \- I liked the varied course profile, but not my best executed race.
12. **Long Haul** \- Pushed too hard early and paid the price.  Beware the hot January weather in FL if you're from up north.
13. **C&amp;O Canal** \- DNFed my first attempt, poorly executed second go, and rainy 40 degree temps both years.

The Adv Skin 12 for example has quite a lot of actual space inside to put a ton of calories and a ton of spare water between refills, but I'm curious how much is actually practical to carry in a vest setup, compared to just throwing on an ultralight minimalist pack for a more comfortable carry. I'm making the assumption here that in the context of ultrarunning, ""comfortable"" would mean a real transferrable improvement that would increase overall average speed, from no longer moving awkwardly / lots of heavy bouncing without a hip belt.

I'm hoping to field some different perspectives on how you all might approach my current situation.  I'm about 2.5 weeks from my first 50 mile race.  I wrapped up my peak weeks with a 22 mile run this past weekend, but have come down sick since then.  Now I have gotten a Covid test and am awaiting results, so any hypotheticals here will be assuming a negative result! (If positive, well that will be a whole different scenario.) I had a spike of a fever for about 24 hours on Monday, and have had a sore throat and cold symptoms in the days since. I've managed shortened versions of my scheduled runs, but on today's had to call it early due to dizziness/weakness. 

I'm scheduled for one more long run, \~18mi, this weekend before starting the taper. I'm wondering, at this point in the training, how detrimental is it to miss these training runs? Is there a point of days off at which you wouldn't expect to rebound and be race ready? I'm prepared to rest a few days to get back to health,  but if a few days turns into a week or more, will I be wildly undertrained?

Up until now, training has gone really well with a peak around 60mpw, long runs feeling great and basically no missed runs in my plan. While I've run for years, I don't have much racing experience and thus haven't gone through many peak/taper cycles.  Any insight would be really appreciated, thanks in advance!",1604520018

ultrarunning,CompetitiveDuck,Calendar Club Complete - October,"I completed the Calendar Club Challenge for October. For those not familiar, the overall premise is you run/walk the miles for the corresponding day. So the 1st is 1 mile, 2nd is 2 miles, 10th is 10 miles, 25th is 25 miles all the way up to 31 miles on the 31st. From the 26th on, it is a marathon a day. You don’t have to do all the miles at once. You can break it into chunks throughout the day, or run/walk but you have to do the miles in the 24 hours of that specific day. I got the initial idea from Jesse Itzler who did it in February of this year and I thought it would be a great challenge idea. With the wildfires in the mountains and needing a break from climbing, I figured October would be a good month to do it. It ended up being late nights, early mornings, Midnight miles before an early morning flight to Chicago, and 25 miles in a Denver blizzard with a high of 15 degrees but it was worth it.

ultrarunning,Thehealthygamer,Finished my first 24 hour race! Would like some advice on training/food.,"Finished my first 24 hour race today. Super beautiful course out in Moab, UT.

The race was a 7.1 mile loop. About 800ft of gain in the first 3.5 miles then flat downhill road back to the start/finish.

Wore a Whoop, here's some of that data. Thought it was kinda interesting. 

Beginning: https://ibb.co/tzJZ9g3
End: https://ibb.co/597zyzT

The goal was to hit 100 miles. Was doing pretty good, did 12 laps at 85.2 miles in 20:15. Then my left knee just flared up and decided it didn't want to bend anymore. Something in there was super inflamed. So I just hobbled around the 1/2 mile camp loop for the last 3:45. Ended up with 95.75 miles with 9,795 of gain.

I've done a 53 miler before this so this was the first past that mileage. 

Actually pretty happy with the results because I only had about 3 weeks of train up and the longest run I did was a 15 miler. Worked wildland fire this year and we were on fires for 4 months straight until Oct, so I'd spent 3 months prior without running at all, just a lot of hiking up steep mountains with a heavy pack. 

So, questions:

* How much weekly mileage is ideal going into a 100?

* I ate A LOT. Lots of candy, lots of tater tots and bacon and whatever else they had. Was putting down ~3-400 cals an hour. Drank a bunch of sports mix and coke. My stomach really started to just feel... unwell. Pooped about 5 times on the course and by the end I just had this achy stomach that felt like I might shit myself at any time. This lead to me not eating anything but fruit for the last 3 hours and my performance noticeably dropped and I went deeply hypoglycemic until I finally ate some pancakes. Any strategies to rectify this or just part of ultras?

ultrarunning,Thrusthamster,I did three 50Ks in 2 months as a beginner,"I decided this summer to try for a Norwegian award called ""Ultrafatet"" (the Ultra Plaque/Plate I guess). I haven't been running much but I had 3 years of lots of long days of mountaineering behind me, and doing up to 6 hours of stair climbing and box stepping behind me.

For my training I could already do a fairly okey half marathon, and tried to do about 3 runs a week, gradually increasing my long run. Tried to stick to trails to at least get some elevation gain in (I used to do 3000-5000 a week on the box and stairs). My longest runs for training I built up to 26 km, at a much slower pace than the races.

I didn't feel ready during early summer since I started running around June, so I picked out 3 races that happened after my summer vacation in August. The races I signed on for started getting cancelled. Eventually I got signed up for 2 small races and 1 bigger race that didn't get cancelled probably because it was in an area with few covid infections. 

Purposefully I signed up for the flattest races I could find to try to increase my chance of completing it.

First 50K went in a roughly 5K loop. I ran at what I thought would be a comfortable pace, and I did manage to keep that pace almost the whole way. In the end I did it in 5h59m. I won my class because I was the only guy in it, but the only other guy doing the 50K had apparently run 200 marathons and he was only 2 minutes ahead of me. I think what helped me do the race was pain tolerance and mental strength from all the mountaineering (usually feels like you'll never get to the summit). Also the race going in a loop made it easier to motivate myself and make sure to not walk too much. Still, after the marathon, the last 8 km or so were a lot of walking as my hip flexors and feet were killing me. Also, ball chafing. 

I walked normally again after around 24 hours (which I've found is a general rule for me so far).

Next race had 4x the elevation gain with around 800m where about half of it was the last 3 km. 57 km in total but I thought if I manage the first 50K the last 7 km I'll crawl up or something.

This was self-supported so I brought 2 muesli bars for every hour and kept that going for the whole race (for magical 300 calorie ceiling I've heard of). First 25 km was fine. Then I struggled a lot and walked a lot, took too many pee breaks between 25-40 km. Then I got a second wind and could run more or less without stopping until the last uphill. Already made a deal with myself that I'd walk the last hill. I was last at 25-40 but passed 4 people in the last 17 km. Still the last 10 km was probably the longest 10K I've ever done. Did the 50K in 6h30m and the 57K in 7h49m.

The last race I trained much more beforehand but nothing more than about 40 km a week with building up my long run. Also introduced the box steps for one of my weekly sessions. 

The last race was 50K, in the dark yesterday. I pulled through fine, but I did the 50K in 7h14m this time. It could be that doing 3 ultras in 2 months as a beginner might lead to getting some long-term fatigue that you don't really notice. But this race I ran the whole way, had to walk much less, and wasn't in that much pain. Maybe 3 out of 10 for 6 hours.

In case anyone reads all this I just thought I'd offer my experience as a beginner coming from another stamina sport. I had run a bit before but literally 1 or 2 runs a year was what I did. But I think if you're used to 8-16 hour effort several days in a row like from mountaineering, and you can run a half marathon without dying, you only need a few months of getting your muscles used to running to do a 50K.

I am looking to find a route that would allow me to do a one-way or looped 50 miler unsupported nearby.

ultrarunning,Ainur95,How hard is to finish UTMB under 30 hours?,"Last days I have some fantasies about that mythical race and I hope to see myself one day in Chamonix. Obviously, that is on hold for quite some time, but building base and collecting kilometres daily and monthly is going pretty well (knock-knock!).   


I consider myself for more than a recreational runner, but still an amateur who really loves running and spending time on feet. For the last few months my average weekly mileage was a little over 100 km with at least 2000 m of elevation. That's not much climbing considering mileage, but for now I think it's enough. There are no races, no projects, just building base. And for now I'm not planning to raise weekly mileage, going above that probably includes days with double runs and I'm not sure that I need them right now.   


Just a glance on my average week: 

Monday: strength 

Tuesday: 16 km w/450 m of elev. @ 4:47/km 

Wednesday: 10,6 km @ 5min/km (flattish trail, &lt;100 m of elev.) 

Thursday: 23 km w/560 m of elev. @ 4:51/km 

Friday: like Wednesday 

Saturday: 31,5 km w/1,213 m of elev. @ 5:30 or slower 

Sunday: 10,6 km reeeally easy on that flattish trail

   
I'm not a big fan of speed work, but when I do any fast running, it's 12 km in 45 minutes (3:45/km). I have this loop around my house and it's either really slow running (above 1 hour) or that fast (fast for my terms).  

So -- you have some picture about me and my running. I have few ultras in my legs, but neither is longer than 80 km. UTMB or any 100 miler is other world and I have no experience in it, but I have time and I have will to correct and improve my running. As the title says, I shoot high and I would like to finish under 30 hours. Is it possible with my current training and what should I change and introduce?",1603991397

I was confused with the dates (I thought the Halloween Saturday was the only 100 mile start date) and with COVID I just wrote off being able to run it in 2020.  

I then found out today, there was a Thursday start option which allows me not to miss the kids on Halloween.  The problem is, unlike the 100 miler I ran back in January where I prepared for months, I haven't done a run over 12 miles in eight months.  I've been working out (Mtn biking, shorter runs of 3-6 miles), but definitely not preparing for a 100 miler.

I've been reading this sub since before I could even run a mile, just dreaming about the day I could call myself an ultra runner. And today is that day! 

Not posting a full race report, just my quick story from Couch to Ultra to help other newbies like myself. I did a lot of things the wrong/hard way, but learned so much.

Race info - 50k, Crushed Limestone Trail, Out and Back, only 1000ft elevation, 15 degrees.

I made my A goal of sub 6 hours with only a min to spare - 5:58:30.

**Training.**

I started Couch To 5K in June of 2019. I literally could not run half a mile. I weighed 220 at 24% Body Fat at 6 feet tall then. I made great progress and right afterward started a 14 week Half Marathon Training Plan. I completed the half in October 2019. That initial progress was amazing but filled with issues and questions. I went through so many kinds of shoes, braces, orthotics, youtbube videos, stretches, foam rolling, and injuries...It was overwhelming, but I stuck with it. Also during this time I started biking like crazy too which helped increase my fitness and lose weight fast. It was a great combo and I went hard in both...too hard as Ive death with the following injuries in the last 16 months that have been some huge physical and mental set backs.

Planters Facetious, ITBS, Stress Fracture, Knee Pain, 2 Broken Ribs, Type 3 Shoulder Seperation, Extensor Tendonitis, and all the normal growing pains like shin sprints and tight calves. I am now free of all of these except the Extensor Tendonitis, but Im in PT now and hope to finally run truly pain free. 

After the Half I started a 50k Training plan for a race that would be late Jan 2020. I stuck to it as long as I could, but those injuries caught up to me and I had to drop out. After a bad bike crash I lost two months of training and literally started over again in Feb 2020 with the same Half marathon training plan. But I worked it. I worked on my form, my warm ups, my cool downs, strength training, and started caring less about breaking a new 5 or 10k every time I ran and stuck to growing my base through HR training.  Many of my races were canceled due to covid, but finally I had a chance at a small inaugural race near my home city that was doing a 50k.

I have patellar tendonitis as well as some tracking issues on my knees, so I was expecting knee pain - which never came! I was so surprised. Butttt, at about mile 14 (which has been a comfortable distance for me for a while) my ankles started getting really sore and I couldn’t tell if I was pushing too hard or not. 
It was on the inside of both of them, and they just began to become sore in a way they never have before. This lasted consistently throughout the rest of the race. I have never had any issues with ankles before, and because of a history of parkour I’ve actually spent a lot of time focusing on ankle strength training. 
It is the next day, and my legs feel great but I can hardly walk on my ankles.
Has anyone ever experienced this? Or even just crazy soreness coming from virtually nowhere? My only idea is that because the trail was on many mountain bike paths, they could be a bit slopey, forcing my ankles to rotate inward more than they normally would.

ultrarunning,Janalon,Thoughts on the Impact of Stress + Ultra Recovery on Resting Heart Rate,"I'd love to know your thoughts on the impact of Stress + Ultra Recovery on Resting Heart Rate.

I ran my first 55 mile trail race over the weekend. And it was a 'virtual' event at that. A group of runners committed to the race day course, and stashed water and supplies along the route at miles 22, 35, and 43. The food and water was less frequent and plentiful than a typical aid station.  I carried 8lbs of water + food &amp; supplement in my hydration vest. From an aid station perspective, it was stressful to manage- especially the prospect of missing a stash. 

I was on course with about 10 runners- five running a 100mi, and 5 running the 55. They were all faster than me. My prospects were to run at a 'comfortable' pace, but run solo for the entire race OR punch above my desired pace to keep with the pack, and then manage the suck in the back half of the course. I opted for the latter. It's a shitty race-day strategy, but better than the alternative. I understood the consequences and was willing to pay the price.

[https://www.strava.com/activities/4178290264](https://www.strava.com/activities/4178290264)

My resting heart rate is in the low 50's. I'm a public school teacher, and my students have returned back to school under a 'hybrid' plan one week prior to race date. This bumped my resting heart rate up +6 BPM the week prior to the race. My taper runs looked like they were +10 BPM above what I would expect for a relaxed pace. The first 24 hours following the finish, my average resting heart rate was 77. The day after that 66. I'm back down into the 50's three days after. 

I'm not at all shocked that work caused an elevated heart rate. Yay stress. However, I didn't expect to see my HR elevated so high for so so many days after the race. Is this a typical experience? Or due to the fact that I ran such a stressful event?",1602587669
ultrarunning,reschly,Is there a secret to running 100 miles,"I've completed a 50k/31M race (1 of 1).  
I've completed a 40M race (1 of 1)  
I've completed 50M races (2 of 3).  
And a bunch self-supported runs of 20+ miles and/or 5K+ vert.

I attempted my first 100M (15K vert) event this past weekend, but at mile 60 (11k vert) was feeling sore (calves, ankles, knees) and started to have troubles eating food, which has in the past correlated with ""you're not going to finish and are also going to have a really bad time"".  The next potential drop point at this event was 15 miles away, so I made the low-risk choice to drop at 60M (there's always another event, right?).

Is there a secret to avoiding a sore lower body?  Nutrition seemed fine before the 60M aid station (no puking, ate something every hour or so; never felt under-salted like I did in my failed 50M).  I wore the same shoes (Asics) that have gotten through my other events).  Never ran out of fluid in my pack. Lungs were great (rode 18 miles on bike the day after). Someone mid-event suggested ibuprofen to dull the pain, but I think I'd want to be aware of any pain to avoid long-term damage.  

Is there a secret to avoiding lower body pain?  Is pain a warning to stop or a challenge to overcome?  Is that something everyone deals just guts out?",1602562230

ultrarunning,1320401,Eating Mentality,"TL;DR - I got into running 8 years ago to lose weight and followed a calories in/calories out approach. I'm on my third year of ultrarunning and the nutrition aspect is my downfall. Any suggestions on for ways to break a food/exercise weight loss mentality and embrace a food for fuel mindset?

When I first started running eight years ago I was an overweight guy in his late 20s. I worked a job that had me traveling 90% of the time, my food choices were poor and I just added on the pounds with ease. I quickly came to the realization that something had to change so I started tracking calories to the extreme. Everything consumed was tracked and every calorie expenditure was tracked. It worked, I lost weight quickly, I developed muscles I'd never had. I was relatively injury free and just enjoying it.

I ran three to six miles a day for five years. But then I started to dabble in longer distances. Maybe I should do a half-marathon? Working my way up to that distance went fairly well, of course some stupid injuries along the way, but it was fun to go further. I bought some Gu because that's what people did on long runs, right? When running a half, I'd have a Gu. Didn't know why, don't think it really helped my half-marathon performance. I was doing well, running sub 90 minutes for most of my races. Having fun!

Then came the 50k. I found a group to run with, we had a great time doing two, three, four-plus hour trail runs. It was so much fun! But, I needed to learn to eat more before, durning, and after. And forget about calories in/calories out for weight loss; rather I needed to focus on calories in/calories out to keep moving.

It's been hard to make that mental shift. I still worry about one day ballooning back up to my 200+lb self. And now, in my mid-30s I wonder if I'd ever get it back down. As proof to myself that this can happen, I've added 15lbs from my lowest weight. My wife says I was too thin back then and she is probably right. But that nagging feeling is hard to shake.

This past weekend I was helping a friend with an Everesting attempt on a local hill. I had originally planned to do the full thing but decided earlier in the week to just do six hours as I'm dealing with some injuries. Since it was only going to be six hours, I didn't plan the nutrition. To be clear, I had a ton of food in our car aid station. I had peanut butter, nutella, bread, chips, candy, soda. But, none of it was prepared. So it never got consumed. What was to be six hours turned into eight (by choice - we were having fun) but I hadn't fueled for eight. In retrospect, I ate less than 2,000 calories for eight hours and 11,000' of climbing in 13 miles. My last lap up I bonked hard and couldn't recover so called it a day. I continued to feel like crap for a good chunk of the day - all because I didn't take nutrition seriously. I had a plan for it but I failed to execute it well (that's the motto for 2020's training, so at least I'm consistent).

Going forward, I know I need to prepare food that I intend to eat. Races are great because I have no problem eating at an aid station. Where I've faltered is on these long training runs without a good plan. Aside from better planning, I would love other suggestions for ways to break that mental weight loss game and embrace a food for fuel mindset.",1602509548
ultrarunning,spooklordpoo,Does anyone wear regular road shoes for trail ultras?,"I tend to struggle with finding a trail shoe I really love and that works for me.   


Did a 100k the other weekend in some salomon sense rides and after I got to a road section about 11 hours in, the moment my feet hit the road, my feet just felt incredibly damn sore.   


Normally I run in Hokas for trails, but in the speedgoat 4 my pinky toes will feel numb and in the speedgoat Evo i just feel not confident in my step (running on slants etc)

&amp;#x200B;

The salomon sense ride 2/3s feel perfect to me, but the lack of cushion definitely was rough. I'm a little heavier around 5'10.5 height and sit around 177-181 lbs (80ish kgs and 180cm roughly), I'm also a slow runner and about 1.5 years into the hobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm wondering if anyone here just runs their trail ultras in road shoes as I am quite happy in the road shoes I frequent. Do you think I need to just get better and be able to handle more miles in my Salomons? Or, suck it up and wear the Hokas and just deal with how they feel?

ultrarunning,Sharnington,Race report - Taupo Ultra 74km,"A few weeks ago I posted here about undertaking my first Ultra.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/ieqkkz/6_weeks_out_from_my_first_ultra_74km/

Yesterday was race day and had such a good day out on the course.

I finished in 18th out of 65ish runners with a time 9 hours 8 minutes. 

Started out at 4am getting dropped off at the bus and then taken to a ferry to be dropped at our start line on a remote beach across the lake. 

Running started around 7.30, felt good for the first 10-15km and kept a nice pace. Plenty of climbing and some rolling farmland

Made sure I eating and taking on plenty of fluids (something I've been bad at in training) and took walking breaks on uphills to conserve my energy(THANKS REDDIT) 

Felt really good up until the 22-25km mark and hit my first wall. My legs just started seizing up and I went into panic mode. Luckily I found someone in a similar situation and we walked it out and kept each other going for 2-3km and I came out the otherside. Was such a relief.

After my first wall I had a surge of relief and adrenaline and decided I was going to make up for the lost time. Went hard for 25mins and clawed back some time and got my pace back on track.

Going so hard after having some trouble may not have been the best call as I went through another period of pain and had to slow right down. This time round was mentally tolling as I was starting to think the rest of the race was going to be a pattern of this (wall, me trying to push through, more pain).

After the second wall was broken I began to feel alot better and my body sort of accepted what was to come. Walked and ran my way through the next section making sure I was not letting my pace drop away.

Persevering into the 50km aid station and my fiancee and kids were waiting there for me. Seeing them was such a relief and was exactly what I needed. 

Directly after the aid station was a hard climbing section. I gritted my teeth and visualized getting to the finish line.
Amazingly I started to feel a second wind and my body was responding well. I went as hard as I could through the last 24km. 

Once I had about 6km to go I really put my foot down and racked up some 6-7 minute kms to the finish. 

Crossing the finish line was the biggest relief. Was overwhelmed with endorphins and couldn't  believe that I had actually done it. I hugged my kids and fiancee, grabbed a cup of soup from the food tent and lay on my back and looked at the clouds contemplating my life LOL.

Amazing experience! Can't wait for the next one!",1602361027

### Training
I had signed up for my first ultra that was supposed to be 10/10/2020 but was cancelled early September. I was bummed but decided to continue training. I thought about going somewhere new for my solo race but work got busy and for safety reasons it would be better to stay close to home. There is a half marathon on 10/10 that will use the same course I've been running and training on and I didn't want to be bothered with that. So I ran this morning 10/9.

I followed the Hal Higdon ultra (50k) plan https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/ . I started the plan on April 12 so just shy of 6 month of training! I am also a streak runner so on rest days I still ran my 3 miles (easy). I didn't do speedwork and just kept to the trails. I live in similar geography of where the ultra was set to be.

In addition to running every morning I would change and walk my dog a mile as my cool down, followed by a short yoga routine. Every other day I would do the /r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine to keep some muscle/strength.

Diet was vegan (plant-powered!). Oatmeal with ground flaxseed, walnuts, and blueberries. Lunch would usually be PBJ. Dinner rice and beans or pasta. Keeping things simple. Lots of veggies, water, and kombucha. Cut way back on alcohol. I lost about 15 pounds, dropping to ~140. 

Training fuel for anything longer than 8 miles would be a GU gel before the run, plus some tailwind in my bottle. For longer runs I would have one bottle of water, one bottle of tailwind, plus a GU for every ~50mins or so. Once I got longer distance (I forget when, I had the 1.5L water bladder plus 2 bottles of tailwind in bottles.

### Pre-race
During the long runs in training (4+ hours) I would get bad GI stuff brewing and on my last 30mile run I barely made it home in time. Did some reading and decided to try imodium (hence the goal of not shitting my pants). The afternoon I was able to set up all of my gear, fill my bottles, got someone to walk the dog in the morning, and got to bed early. No new foods, just keeping it simple. Staying hydrated. Charged my watch and MP3 player. Loaded up my This American Life podcasts (eps 397-404)

### Race
Early start! I woke up about 3:45am, a little late. Loaded up stuff, took one imodium pill and a GU gel plus water. Left the house about 4:10. Still dark out and had my head lamp. 

First 10 miles were on a counterclockwise loop around town. This is the direction I usually go each day different distances, out and back (so I catch the sunrise). This loop was entirely in the dark. One GU, not much water or tailwind as it was cool out. Saw a coyote pup on the trail that scared the shit out of me. Jumped out in front of me before running off but still close.

Miles 10-19 were most of another loop. Cut short to avoid crossing a street. Just pure uninterrupted trail! Got to watch the sunrise over the buttes, and then when I reached the far side of the loop I saw the Vermillion Cliffs lit up. Enjoying myself.

Miles 19-26.75 Turned around and ran back the way I came. The sun has gone up so I wasn't running directly into the sun. Just chugging along.

Miles 26.75-30.15 Turned around again to avoid crossing streets. This was grueling mentally.

Miles 30.15-35.15 Hit my turnaround point and was on the home stretch! This was awesome! I tried to relax a little bit, just finish. I know once I got to mile 32 I kept telling myself 'it's just 3 miles. I've run at least 3 miles every day for over a year. I got this'. Hit a bit of a wall here, ran out of water, and my tailwind was warm and gross lol



### Post-race
FINISHED! Got back about 10:30. Was excited to get home and just out of the sun. Did my yoga to stretch a little bit. Checked my water and it was empty (1.5L). Tailwind I started with 1L and had about 5oz left. I ate 4 or 5 GU Gels. Some breakfast and a shower. Was able to clock in to my meetings at noon. Didn't take any time off just clocked in late lol.

ultrarunning,Capt_Darling8,"An insight into running my first 100miles. Trust me, I learned a lot.","So 2020, what a year. This time last year I paid to enter the Robin Hood 100mile Race. 100 Miles around Sherwood Forest (well, twice). I even entered a few shorter ultras as build up throughout the year which were obviously cancelled. My story starts here...


Firstly, running a 100 miles is the hardest physical activity I have ever completed, this includes 9 years in the Army and all Sandhurst has to throw at you.  That said, I planned for the challenge and expected it to be hard.  I ran (and walked) the 100miles in 19hours and 40minutes. I'm very proud of this time!


2020 has been a difficult year, and my plan was very much thrown out of the window.  My build up was to include training races and training beginning in December 2019 to build up. A 30km race in February, Marathon in April (cancelled), 75KM ultra in May (postponed until 2021), Double Marathon (postponed until 2021).

With hindsight, the postponed races really hurt my preparation. Let me explain, I'd only run one marathon and one ultra before, my understanding of refuelling, pacing, kit, equipment and tactics was shabby to say the least. I've been a runner for 2 and half years with a handful of 10km and half marathons...  I really needed to get more experience, it didn't happen and I needed to rely on my training runs.

Training.  Well, this was a shambles!  I can run a 16min 5km, and a  34min 10km. Since the 30k race, my training slowly ramped up. With being furloughed, I had time to train and recover. However, with no races I did just that, a 7 month training block was very long, and I'm certain I peaked a month early.  The other proble, with my training was it was too fast. I never trained at race pace - all my running was too fast. Even my long runs were far faster than they should have been, and not as far. My longest runs were only 50km, and whilst I ran this distance a few times, with hindsight, it wasn't as far.

I also joined a running group aimed closer to middle distance to 10k running in the late summer and whilst this has massively increased my speed, I dont think it helped me much for an ultra..

The race...

Well, this started rather well - at 50km I was in the lead, running with the chap who would eventually go on and win, however at 50km my problems started....  I still don't know why,  but my calfs started cramping quite considerably. As I tend to run on my toes, this became a impossible - i had to change to heal striking as I ran just to continue.  To put it in perspective, my calfs were cramping so much at 50km, I could barely stand.  With the change in running style, somehow I managed to continue but this brought its own problems.  I hadn't trained to run that way, and quickly this became hard on my quads.  By 50miles, I was 2nd but struggling!

Crewing.  My wife crewed for me from mile 50, and I'll say this now - neither of us had any experience of this but without her, I genuinely wouldn't have finished the race. We had arranged to meet at every aid station and she would supplement me with food and kit as required.  This was the biggest success of the run, and actually went really well. Unfortunately,  by 70 miles I could barely eat. My nutrition plan, out of the window, I was hanging on.... just.

The final 30miles....

I've heard an Ultra starts at the halfway point, well I'd argue that up to 70 miles, I was running and was still moving in a positive manner, however it was from here my race started going downhill, quickly....  70miles to 80miles my running decreased and walking became more prevalent, I was struggling to eat and managed to get calories on board with a Guinness.  From 80miles, I was starting to struggle.  Running was becoming increasingly difficult and I was feeling nauseous from my failed nutrition plan.  At mile 87, it was all about to become undone!

The final half marathon.

Let me just say, if I could have kept on running at this point, I probably would have save at least an hour, if not more.  I couldn't run at all any more. When I tried, I was sick. I couldn't eat, I was sick. The only liquid that I could keep down was Tea.  With 13 miles at 4mph (max), I took my time. I also lost time at the last 2 aid stations, especially the last one - 20mins whilst I waited for a gas kettle and had a cuppa! 3miles left, I bimbled to the finish line.


What did I learn?...

1. You can't beat experience, with my cancelled races I couldn't develop or plan a decent nutrition plan, learn from my training and learn for the next one...

2. Training. I genuinely believed that if you train fast. You can slow down for the race and be fine. Oh my god, how naive! Had I trained at race pace, well, I suspect I wouldn't have cramped so early in the race....

3.  Nutrition. I couldn't eat or drink for the last 30miles... I reckon I didn't get the first 50miles right either and that's why... 

4. 100miles is very, very hard. Completing it is a genuine challenge.

5.  Do I want to do it again? No. The recovery after is far too long. Even a month later, I'm struggling to run any distance or speed... that said, my postponed races will definitely be fine.


Hope this helps anyone thinking about running a 100miles, or already signed up! Good luck!",1602193895

ultrarunning,likeakipper8,"Ran my first ultra. It sucked. My second is already booked for May. Should I cancel? (M, 34)","Had been training for my first ultra for nearly a year (training started in November, race was postponed in May and then cancelled, signed up for another which was Saturday) and ran a couple of days ago.

The course was hard as expected, 55k with 2500m of vertical ascent and similar descent, which I couldn't match in training where I live but I was able to get in around 650m of climbing in multiple training runs.

The first 25k was OK, I was able to run the flats and walk the hills as intended. After that my hips and then knees gave me shooting pains whenever I tried to go downhill at any pace, meaning I couldn't run downhill any more and essentially walked it in for the last 30k for a time of 10h40.

I was expecting my calves to give me trouble but with so little actual running my muscles were fine. Nutrition and hydration were also great, so I wasn't tired and was hardly out of breath. 

My May race has been rescheduled for 2021 so before I decide that my old man joints will ruin that race as well and pull out I wanted to ask some more experienced runners if there is anything I can do to strengthen my joints so they can keep up with the rest of my body?

I don't want a repeat of this slow hike when I felt like I could have run it in around 8 hours without the joint issues. Similarly I don't want to abandon and then feel like I could do the race justice later on. What can I do?

TL;DR: Ran my first ultra, joints stopped me running so is it something I can fix before May or should I abandon that idea?",1601880231

**Details:**
North Cottonwood Trailhead to M Trailhead (and home)

26.84 Miles

8645ft Gain

9335ft Descent

**Run Narrative:**

The famous Bridger Ridge Run goes from the Fairy Lake trailhead in Bozeman, and ends at the ""M"" Trial just north of town for 19 tough and gorgeous miles.  But the road to Fairy Lake being so rough and times being what they are, I chose an easier trailhead to take off from rather than the official run - easier from the standpoint of the drive for my wife and kids, not for the run. I'm a climber/mountaineer turned trailrunner during COVID times.  I was a competitive runner and skier through high school and some of college, but climbing has been my main focus for more than 15 years.  But for the last 6 months, I've been really training in the mountains, and have logged hundreds of miles on the trail.

I started from the North Cottonwood trailhead at around 730am with temps hovering in the low 40s and crystal clear skies.  The run picks over some rocky terrain for about a half mile, and then immediately gains almost 1k on long, open switchbacks that are supremely runnable.  After that, I entered the woods along a creek for the next three or so miles, criss-crossing and picking my way through brush and rocks. 

At mile 4, the spectacular part of this run begins. The trail opens up onto the sub-alpine foothills, and trees become sparse and are replaced with open fields and stunning views of most of the ridge to come.  A month or so earlier, I had done this section of the run, and was literally running through waist high flowers.  Very Sound of Music.  

But this section of trail involves two small passes that tack on a ton of vertical - so when I hit the start of Sacajawea Peak (9667), I was at 8 miles and 4.5k of vert.  I stopped to snap some photos of some mountain goats, including a mom with her kid, and fuel up a little.  For those familiar with the traditional ridge run, usually you are at about 2 miles and 2k of vert gained, with 17 to go. And one you are up Sac, you are (mostly) on the ridge until you hit the M.

I crossed onto the sub-peak known as Naya-Nuki and found the cairn about a half mile later that marks the turn onto the ""bridger foothills"" trail.  This would be the only section of the route that I hadn't run this summer, and man - I was about to learn some lessons.

The foothills trail is insanely gorgeous - single track along a steep pitch that passes limestone buttresses, pine forest, and open hillsides that afford endless views.  But it drops a lot of elevation, all of which you have to make back up. 

When I hit Ross Pass, I was at a half-marathon and a vertical mile of elevation gain almost exactly.  And to regain the ridge, I had about another thousand feet of climbing through steep, technical terrain. For the first time in my running career, I bonked, and bonked hard.  It was a deep, existential bonk, that came out of nowhere and left me bewildered.  I kept checking my watch - only 13 miles?  The previous weekend, I had pretty casually run a trail marathon, and was feeling so mentally strong  and so fit.  And for about 4 miles, it was all I could do to keep moving forward. 

The section from Ross Pass to Bridger Bowl was brutal, but at the top of Bridger, I hit familiar terrain and new I was only 11 miles from home, with about 4k of descent and 3k more gain.  Knowing the terrain made it a little easier to break up the run mentally, as well as some choice texts of encouragement from friends.  I was definitely in the pain cave still, but at least I was moving.

The last section climbs Saddle Peak (9142), descends and cruises through Baldy (8914) and down trough the M.  The final section was hit by a wildfire that consumed more than 7000 acres and 26 homes, and this was the first time I'd seen it first hand.  A trail I've hiked and run countless times looked utterly foreign - it looks like a moonscape of dust and dr. Seuss trees.  

The run down was uneventful, other than trying to avoid hordes of college kids during our most recent Covid-wave on the way down.  The last two miles are on paved bike path, and I was happy to realize that I had ""run"" for the last 9 or so miles.  

**Takeaways**: I need to get more rest in between these bigger efforts if I want to really make them valuable runs.  This is a spectacular setting, and I was a little bummed to have brought less than my best form to it.  Nutrition felt okay, but I need to bring more food - I tend to bring next to nothing, and during a bonk that doesn't help.  But in retrospect, it was excellent mental training. I haven't had a day that was this difficult mentally in ages, and I think it is worth it just to put yourself there. I feel great today, and that's a little telling. I wasn't able to eat a ton yesterday, but have eaten like a Hobbit all day today and feel ready to run.  So, a good training, learning run, and a beautiful setting for some self-induced suffering.",1601866875

Since I don't want my training to go to waste, I am going to run a 100K in my hometown. 3 loops of 21.7 miles. 900 feet of total elevation. I would rather hit the trails but the fires of last month have led to closure of trails, campgrounds and local forests. 

Here's my plan:

1. My place will be the start of every loop. 
2. I'll use it as ""base camp""/aid station. Food, toilet, change of clothes etc...
3. I'll do each loop in a ""washing machine"" pattern to workaround the boredom.
4. I plan to change my clothes for each loop. Shirts, shorts and socks. And apply body glide.
5. I plan to start early (pre-dawn) . 3am.
6. I don't want to think about target pace.  I just want to finish

The race is 32.2 miles with 3k elevation gain between 4500-5500 total elevation. I've ran a few marathon training blocks and recently moved to Colorado. My goal is to finish and to finish well -- not trying to win any awards here. I'd love to come in sub 6 hours as my B goal and sub 5:30 as my A goal assuming everything goes well. 

We're 17 weeks out and I have a decent base and have started putting together a rough draft of my training plan. I put in 100 miles in September with a mix of road, hills, and high elevation trail running. 

The plan totals just under 700 miles with a mix of fartlek, middle distance hills/trail, easy, and long runs. Definitely a jump up from my previous blocks, so it will be a challenge, but it still feels attainable. In my last marathon block I maxed just under 50 MPW as well, but that was at sea level and mostly flat.

ultrarunning,Janalon,Nutrition advice for a self-supported 55mi ultra through the NJ pine barrens.,"At the last minute, the state department did not have the manpower to process the permit. It's far more of a ""this race is not approved"" rather than a ""the permits were rejected"" situation. The race director offered two options: defer or virtual run. My first thought was to defer and put my training toward another 50 miler... but all local trail races are in the same predicament at the moment. So I plan to run the 55 miler on the actual course, which is point-to-point.

There is a small, self-organized group of runners who plan to tackle this as a group support run. There are plans for stashed water and snacks along the route. That's all and well, but I'd rather plan for the worst, and hope for the best. I'm a little less worried about hydration, as there is a city water supply at miles 8 and 21. I'm running with the Salomon Adv 5- two 500ml flasks and a 1.5L bladder. I have experience running with this much water for 33 miles. I'm fairly certain the last water stop should be barely sufficient, and those extra water drops would be more than OK.

I'm more worried about nutrition along the route. I have trained with Larabars and gels and could pack enough to fuel once per hour. But I've never run a 55mi before... and I'm not certain if I should fuel more frequently. My Adv 5 is somewhat limited... especially considering that I will need to also carry a headlamp and lipstick size battery to recharge my watch. There might not be much more room for much more food. I know the ultralight hiking community has parsed out weight to calorie density. And I'm starting to wonder if I should start thinking along those lines to pack extra nutrition.

Again, I hope there are snacks along the route, but I need to prepare as if self-supported. I'm open to any advice you can provide! I don't want to DNF due to poor execution on race-day nutrition.",1601668778

ultrarunning,fallsapart,Winter Running Tight Recommendations (for truly cold running),"Hey everyone,

I'm in the market for some new running tights to replace 18 year old sugio tights.  I've got an REI gift card that I'd like to use up, so I'm hoping for a recommendation for something they have.

I live in Bozeman, and I run in weather well into the negatives.  I often run loops on forest service trails close-ish to my house, so there is frequently wind exposure on ridges.  

So far, I'm considering most the Arcteryx Trino SL pants, Patagonia Peak Mission or Wind Shield tights, or the craft essential winter tights. I'm leaning toward the Trinos, because it sounds like they have a little bit more temperature range to them, and the more ""pants"" like fit might mean on the really cold days I can put some cap beneath.

I feel pretty dialed in on managing the cold (been in Bozeman for a long time now) and backcountry ski and ice climb. I'm just looking for recs on new tights, as its been years since I've had to buy them.

ultrarunning,atxgossiphound,Managing Calf Cramps During a Race,"
tl/dr: what do you do to salvage a race when you feel a cramp starting?

So, this weekend I signed up for a last minute 50k. I've been training for a longer race that was recently cancelled and this race fit into my training schedule. It was similar to recent long runs on slightly easier terrain and the weather was actually pleasant, save for high humidity (this was outside Austin).

Around mile 11, I noticed the telltale signs of a calf cramp. Calf cramps are rare for me and bad ones have only happened in the past while climbing or swimming, never running. I figured I could just take it easy and it'd go away. A few miles of run/walk cycles kept it at bay but around the 13.5 mile mark, I went to switch from walking to running and my right calf seized up on the first step, effectively ending my race.

A humble, painful walk to the starting line ensued. I massaged for 10 minutes or so, but couldn't work it out enough to justify starting the second lap. It turned out to be the right call as it wasn't until the next morning that I could really use my right leg again.

I followed my standard nutrition/salt/water strategy that gets me through hotter, harder runs, so I don't think those were triggers. My feet were a little swollen from the humidity, which made my shoes a little tight, which is the only thing I can think of that may have triggered it.

Since failures are great opportunities to learn: what is the proper protocol to deal with calf cramps during a race?

Should I have stopped and sat down as soon as I noticed it? Should I have walked and avoid the running until it went away?

If you've worked through a bad cramp in a race, how'd you do it?",1600733700

    I’m finding towards the 40-50km mark my legs just seem to start breaking down and don’t feel great. Most of my runs are shorter (3.5-12km). Varies a little randomly throughout the week, then a long run around 15-22km. 

I’m starting to think I need something with some cushion, to be able to safely and successfully up my mileage. My end goal is to do something like a 70-80km race. I’ve tried a couple cushioned shoes that I didn’t really end up liking. I’ve tried the Altra lone peak 4s and some brooks pureflow 7.

I did try the brooks before I bought them in the store just doing some strides etc and they felt good but after taking them out several times they just felt kinda bad. 

Do you guys do the whole running gait test etc and then pick your shoes out from whatever they suggest? I’ve never had one done but I’ve read a lot of science that kinda says they’re bull so I’ve just avoided them and kinda just randomly picked my shoes kinda based off minimal shoe properties like wide toebox, low heel drop, low arch support. 

Right now I feel like I’m coming down with a case of runners knee. So I’m just lost of what to do now. Try another pair of traditional cushioned shoes or just take a break and heal up a bit and do some strength exercises.


TLDR: how do you pick your shoes. Do you do a gait analysis and do you trust them?",1600537108

So at this point I've been through it all: gels, bars and real food, and Tailwind. Each had its strengths and weaknesses, like Tailwind is bulky and not a real option if you need to separate hydration and fuel. 

I don't know what to settle on. I feel like fruit and nut energy bars give the best sustained energy (and leaving me feeling fed), though they don't deliver the same burst as a gel. On the other hand, running a long distance on gels alone is brutal on the stomach.

While the most likely thing would have been that it got cancelled due to the Covid it actually got cancelled less than 24 hours before due to horrible wildfire smoke and air pollution conditions. It was tough pill to swallow. I had trained and tapered and then... nothing. On top of that no running for almost a week now due to the continued air quality. Almost to my breaking point I remembered I had access to a really good respirator/filters that would filter out all the bad stuff in the air. Wasn't sure how it would work out but I've done a 3 mile and 8 mile run over the last 2 days and while not the most enjoyable experience it was workable. Almost felt like training at altitude in a way. I took it really slow and ran by effort and felt good. No immediate bad affects other than a sore nose and man is that thing uncomfortable after awhile.

I also know that many have it much worse than me and have lost their homes or worse to the wildfires so this rant is by no means a way to belittle that. It's really just a crazy time out here.

I'm signed up for a 50 miler first weekend in November and hoping that will be redemption for the missed race.

I've been running 45mpw average for the last 9 months, with a 3-4 hour long run and a speed session each week.  70% of my running is on trails, usually can get between 3-5k vert on the week. The volume has felt great, injury free and still super exciting mentally.  I've had some different races cancelled and seem to finally be settled on what looks to be a more beginner-friendly 50 miler in November. This will be my first 50 miler -  I'm excited to see what I can do, hopefully finish, but not beat myself up over times, etc. 

I should be able to work up to 55-60mpw for some peak weeks, but because of a busy work schedule I won't have the ability to run back-to-back long runs.  Has anyone had success in a similar situation? I have seen they are highly recommended, but I know if I can make it happen, it will be a last minute schedule bonus. 

I'm really going to lean on the base I've got and the months of consistent volume - I similarly probably won't be able to put together any runs upwards of 25 miles beforehand.

ultrarunning,LordPoopturd,Race Report: Eden Valley Ultra Trail 50k,"### Race Information
* **Name:** Eden Valley 50k
* **Date:** September 12, 2020
* **Distance:** 50 kilometers
* **Location:** Kent, UK

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Finish in one piece | *Yes* |
| B | Sub 4:30 | *No* |

### Training
I've only been running seriously since December, although I ran track and XC when I was younger so it didn't take me long to establish a base.

I signed up for this race about seven weeks ago. I was running 35-40 mpw at the time. I gradually increased my mileage and peaked around 60 three weeks ago. The main thing I did differently was increase my long runs by a lot. I bumped them up from 2 hours to 3+ hours, and most weekends I would do back-to-back long runs (although the second long run was rarely more than 2 hours). My last few back-to-backs totaled more than 50k, and my final back-to-back session totaled just under 40 miles. After that, I tapered well and I felt fresh by race day.

However, I made the mistake that a lot of trail noobs make. I didn't spend nearly enough time training on the type of terrain that I would race on.

### Pre-race
The race was held in a beautiful area in the English countryside, and the weather was perfect. Being in a big field in the middle of the woods, it was very easy to follow social distancing rules. They also had us line up in separate groups based on estimated finish times, and they staggered the starts one-by-one, with several seconds between each person and 10 minutes in between each big group.

### Race
I went out with the lead group. I started the race feeling very overconfident. But luckily it didn't take me long to realize that I was going out too fast, so after the first couple of miles I let the group get away from me and settled into my own pace. I ran more or less on my own for the first 18-20k. I passed through the first aid station feeling great. At one point I made a wrong turn, but something felt off so I took out my phone and checked the GPX file of the course and found my way back.

A group of runners caught up to me somewhere around 18-20k and we ran together for a while. I was still feeling great, but the bumps and hills and rugged terrain were starting to get to me. I wasn't tired but my quads began feeling heavy, which never happened in training. Around 25k, we got to a series of very steep hills. All of us walked up them rather than try to tough it out and tire out our legs. But we ran down all the steep downhill sections, and those likely burned out my quads just as much.

This group of runners got away from me at the second aid station. After refueling there, I ran on my own for a little while and soon caught up to a few people from the group who had fallen back. Around this point I noticed the weather getting hotter. I stayed with them for a few miles, but when we were running through a flat section through some wide open farmland, the heat started getting to me so I slowed down and let them go. At this point, I started feeling the dreaded ""bonk"" creeping up on me. I started hydrating and eating more frequently, trying to stave off the inevitable bonk for as long as I could.

Eventually I jogged in to the third and final aid station. At this point I was feeling destroyed. I was really unwell. I sat down in a chair and genuinely thought I was done. My body did not want to move any more. I stayed at that aid station for probably 10 minutes. I drank some coke and ate some salty chips (sorry, ""crisps""). Eventually I got up and tried to get moving again, but I literally couldn't run for more than a minute or so. My body just wouldn't do it. I had bonked spectacularly.

There were 7 miles between the last aid station and the finish. I walked the first one, maybe two. I was in a bad, bad state. But after a little while, my state improved a bit. I still felt terrible, but I was able to start jogging at a slow pace again. I passed through a town with about 4 miles to go, and actually started feeling good enough to run at a pace that felt somewhat normal. I'm not sure if this qualifies as ""coming back"" from a bonk, because I still felt like death, but I did come back from the bonk in the sense that I was able to settle back into some semblance of a run.

I still had to stop and walk a few times in those last few miles any time there was a hill. But for the most part, I ran it in. I must have been running way slower than I thought though, just based on how long those last 4 miles took. At this point I was feeling delirious, but when I came across an area that I recognized from the beginning of the race, I knew there was less than a mile left so I just booked it as fast as I could. I finished the race in 6 hours.

### Nutrition/Hydration
I brought my favorite long-run snacks with me, apricots and granola bars. At the aid stations, I would eat either chips (""crisps"") or bananas. I didn't have any stomach issues. I should have eaten a bit more, but I think I did okay in terms of taking in calories. Hydration was the bigger issue for me. I felt like I was drinking plenty of water, but something must have been off. I was drinking water mixed with ""Zero"" electrolyte tablets. Zero is really not the best brand; I normally stick with Nuun but I ran out of Nuuns and forgot to buy more.

Aside from the trails killing my leg muscles too early in the race, dehydration was probably the main factor in my bonk. I literally didn't have to pee all day despite drinking plenty. Also, my tongue went numb (?!) in the last few miles of the race. It was a bit scary.

### Post-race
The organizers did an amazing job putting this race together. It was a great event and the whole thing went smoothly.

This was very humbling for me; I knew that trail racing was different but I didn't realize just how different it was. I'm aware that I didn't spend a very long time training for this, so I'm just happy to have completed it and to be able to say that I've done an ultramarathon.

I've got a marathon coming up in November on a 100% flat, level course. After that I plan to focus on speed and improving my 5k/10k times. So it will probably be quite a while before I do another trail ultra, and I doubt I'd ever do more than two or three of these a year. But, having said that, I will definitely be back for more. This race was as fun as it was painful, and it's made an ultramarathon fan out of me.

Both sexes improved body composition, but because I was cuducting testing on a stationary bike (Calibrated ergo) body mass wasn't restricting performance like with running.

If you're into low carb or keto, I'd recommend listening because there a few important points with low carb that are often overlooked.

Hi everyone! I follow you all but haven't been very vocal because I have yet to finish my first ultra. I was ready for my 50k in April, but we all know what went down that put the kibosh on that. Then I was too depressed to run for a few months, but I'm BACK! I deferred with the same race company locally and they are doing a timed ultra in October, so I am signed up for the 12-hour. I'm pumped, and feel pretty good about my training, the time I have left, etc. 

What I would love advice on is in regards to crewing for a friend next weekend. She and I were training for the same 50k in a training group, but she had a 50-mile race scheduled for this month that had to cancel. It's a much bigger race than the little local trail races we do, so we understood why they were canceling, but she has been working so hard to train that I told her we should do it anyway. I said I could coordinate a 50 mile run and crew for her while pacing the last 20-25 miles as a training run for me. I put together the aid station plan, a GPX file of the course, we've trained on part of the course, and she has family members coming along to crew, too. 

As ""the details person"" in all of this, I am making sure to bring extras of everything I would want on a long run: lubricant, clothing, snacks, water, hydration mix, the basics. I'll also have road atlases for my car and the other car in case GPS fails. I want to pack a first aid kit, but I'm not sure what the best things would be to put in there since I've never run more than a marathon and never had much trouble with serious blisters or anything. The weather should be 50-60s and we'll be running long enough to need light, so I'll bring extra headlamps and batteries.

ultrarunning,trail-pact,Should I go for a 50k at the end of January?,"Fitness background:

Used to run casually (1-2 miles every other day) to supplement rock climbing and weight training. I was introduced to racing about a year ago and started to get more into it. 

• Last May I ran my first HM (~2Hr finish time)
• Since then I’ve probably ran HM distance 5 times
• Finished the GVRAT 1000k this summer (averaging over 5 miles per day). Although this was including ~15 walking miles per week
• Most recently I worked up to averaging 30-35 MPW for a few weeks 
• Longest distance run was last month of 16 miles. That was also my longest run duration of 3 hours 13 min. 
• Hardest/longest hikes I’ve done are 2 14ers in CO 

After the GVRAT I took some time off to help a lingering IT flare up. Just started a base plan starting at 18-22 MPW. Legs are feeling fine so far. 

At the end of January there’s an awesome looking race that has both 30k/50k options. Debating either very slowly building base back up and going for the 30k/looking for a 50k maybe next spring or fall OR hop into a 16 week plan at the end of the month to shoot for the 50k.

More specifically, I’ll be moving to Colorado in a few months and I have my eyes set on Leadville. That said, I’m hoping to pick up any pieces of advice for the following questions:

* Is the Leadville 100 a realistic goal for the summer of 2021? 2022?
* What kind of goals should I be setting each month? Trying to add 5, 10 miles per month to my max run? Is this even the correct approach?
* How often do you push yourself to your max distance (every run, once a week, once a month)?
* What’s a realistic timeframe for stretching my max of 12 miles to a marathon? From marathon to say, 35 miles, 45 etc.
* I've often seen that you shouldn't run the distance of a race until race day. This sounds bogus, I don't need to feel like I accomplished it for the first time, I just want to accomplish it at Leadville when the time comes. Any thoughts?
* Any running/training advice you would give to a friend?

When I currently run and feel like giving up, it’s got everything to do with feeling like I’m not getting enough oxygen and my body almost feels like it’s capable of continuing.

According to their website, if you cancel within the last 30 days before the race then you get no refund, and I think that makes total sense, but if you have to pull out earlier than that 30 days, they will roll over half of what you paid to the same event the following year. It also says that if the event is canceled and they are unable to reschedule it, then there will be no refunds for anyone. Is this normal? I have worked for race promoters before and I totally get that it is very expensive to put on races like this, but this just felt a little scummy to me. Am I crazy?",1599597256

I’m due to be running a 50 miler at the end of February. I’ve run a very hilly 50k before and when not training run about 25 miles per week over 3 days. 

My issue is I think I’m going to struggle getting in more than 3 days of running per week. I can probably push it to 4 days per week during bigger mileage weeks but I think most weeks especially in the early stages will likely have to be done over 3 days. 

My question is is it possible to train properly for the 50 miler over mainly 3-4 days per week? 

I should mention that the 50miler is much flatter than the 50k I did. I’m very much a middle of the pack runner and I’m not bothered about absolutely smashing it, I just want to be able to finish without injuring myself to be honest. 

Is it doable or should I really be putting this off until I have fewer other commitments?

This seems foolhardy. It is a bad example. It feels disrespectful to the sport. I think mostly though, it is going to encourage people with little training to make poor decisions that will land them in over their heads.

I delayed the attempt by a day, as there was forecast to be a gale-force headwind coming straight off the North Sea. I set out in perfect conditions and had support crew waiting at 42km to replenish my water.

The second half had consistent rolling hills, which were way tougher than I anticipated, and I finished a few minutes short of my target, but well ahead of the old record.

But here's the good bit: I got home and went to upload my time for verification, only to find that the British 100km champion had gone out the same weekend and run the same route two hours faster than me.

Strava activity: [https://www.strava.com/activities/3918653000](https://www.strava.com/activities/3918653000)

Had a 50k trail run fall through so decided to do a local run by myself. The trail run had 6k ft of climbing so I had planned to run as far as I could to try and make up for the challenge. My goals were:

1. Run from my front door to Oceanside Harbor. \~45ish miles.

2. Run further than 34 miles

3. Run 34 miles

4. Run 31 miles

Woke up at 4am and hit the road. I fought some nausea for the first 30 miles, which was unusual for me. My g/f met me along the way every 5-6 miles so I requested a baked potato for the nausea. No idea why... I didn't eat potatoes in training, but when I was fueling and thinking about the nausea it was like my body spoke up and said, ""Hey, I know exactly what you need. You should get a potato for this stomach ache."" And I'll be damned it if worked. At some starchy, flavorless potato at mile 31 and it practically fixed everything (combined with an occasional ginger chew). 

It was hot and humid (watch read 97 degrees at one point) so aside from the potato, the only thing I felt like eating was stroop waffels and tailwind, so I was sucking down 200 cal of tailwind every hour and forcing myself to take bites of stroop waffels at regular intervals. Thanks to everyone who suggested liquid calories for hot or high altitude efforts. Also, ice wrapped in a bandana around your neck is clutch. My heart rate was under control the whole time and I think it was largely due to always having ice on my neck and head.

Anyway, I got to 31 miles, body felt pretty good aside from the slight nausea so I decided to keep going to 34. Same story at 34, body still felt good, so I just kept going. And once I was past 34 miles, chasing down the miles felt relatively easy. I suffered for sure - the heat sucked and standing still for too long made me feel kinda dizzy - but I never felt like quitting. After hitting 34, every extra mile was icing on the cake until I made it to Oceanside Harbor for 47.03 miles.

I did an 8/3 run/walk strategy and it worked very, very well. In hindsight I could have pushed the pace, but this being my first ultra I just wanted to make sure I was going to hit my goals. Prior to this my longest effort was 27 miles in training. It's been a week since the run and my legs feel completely recovered. My upper lungs and throat are kind of sensitive and I have a mild cough, so I'm going to take a few more days off, but overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to do another one. Thinking of doing the Avalon 50 in January. I'm also interested in last man standing events and 24 hours races... kind of toying with the idea of running a 10k loop around my house for 24 hours. I think I'll also make a tradition out of this run, a HWY 101 50 miler from DT San Diego to Oceanside. Next time I'll change up the course slightly to grab those extra 3 miles and make it a proper 50.

Thanks again, all. Hope your training is going well.",1598282816
ultrarunning,PokkeFlokke,Running ultras in 2021?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a while now, soaking up all your advice, tips and tricks (for which thanks!). 

I’m a pretty new runner from the very flat Belgium, looking to start training for my first ultramarathon(s) in 2021. Some background: I started running when lockdown hit us in the beginning of March, and have gradually built up to running 4 times a week for 30-40K a week, longest runs so far are around 15-16K. I signed up for my first trails races in September (13K, 660D+), Oktober (17K, 220 D+) and November (15K, 360D+).

I’ve been thinking of starting to build up towards longer distances, and have set my sights on a 55K, 2060D+ trail race in Belgium near the end of March in 2021 (Crêtes de Spa if anyone has experience there?). However, this would be the buildup towards the Stelvio ultra trail in Northern Italy in the beginning of July, coming in at 79.9K, 5730D+. 

My questions to you are as follows:
1. Is this reasonable considering my current base + with the time available? If yes, any advice before I set out on this journey? If no, other recommendations or ideas about what my base should be before?
2. Has anyone here run the Stelvio ultra? How is it? Any advice preparing?

Thanks so much!",1598250535

Does anyone know how often a female, 125 lbs ish should fuel? Some race report from a female winner said every 20 minutes. Also, drop bag at the summit- is this necessary for dry socks and shoes? Do I bother with this?

Last month, I ran to a town 80 miles away over 2 days carrying a pack with some food and a sleeping bag.

ultrarunning,jelllybelllykellly,Do I try to do my first ultra this year or just give up on 2020?,"So I was training for my first ultra in the spring, which was going to be Chuckanut 50K in March. I had put in the work, felt great and was super excited and then COVID hit days before the race. I’m an Emerg RN so work was nuts, race was cancelled and I stopped running for about a month (partly from exhaustion and partly from lack of motivation). I gradually got back into running and decided fuck 2020, I’m gunna run this distance on my own and it’s gunna be awesome. I rallied some friends who were going to help pace me and set a date for sept 5th. Training was going great and I was finally feeling positive and motivated for the first time since March.

Last week I fell on a training run, rolled my ankle, now have a grade 2 ATFL sprain and am out for another 3-5 weeks. My Physio was asking if I think I’m going to try training again once my ankles healed up but I’m just so discouraged now and have completely lost motivation again. 

Do I just give up and try again in 2021? Or do I suck it up, start from square one again and try and do it in the fall? Halp!",1598144958
ultrarunning,adrenalbean,Anyone else work nights?,"I work 12 hour nights, 6 on, 8 off. It's made training tricky especially now that I'm increasing distances. I recently completed my first 50k but I'm often fantasizing about how much more I'd be able to accomplish with consistent sleep. I am always so tired. I've been needing to add volume but struggle to run more than 6 miles (often only getting in 2 or nothing at all) between shifts. The saving grace has been my 8 off, giving me time to sleep and night and run longer during the day.

I'm taking a three week vacation and will attempt an 80k in the middle of it after hopefully adjusting to a normal sleep schedule. 

I'm seriously considering switching to days (less pay) as I start nursing school and still want to be able to train for a self-supported 100k race next summer. Any thoughts? How have you managed to keep growing your miles while working nights?",1598134005
ultrarunning,Sharnington,6 weeks out from my first Ultra (74km),"About 2 years ago I started running as a way to keep fit while I had an injury from Jiu jitsu (dislocated my elbow).

 I became completely hooked on running and trying to better myself. Last year I ran 4 half's and finished my first marathon and wanted to take the leap and dive into the world of ultra running.

 I signed up for the Taupo ultramarathon (74km) and have spent most of this year training as much as I can between Work, 2 kids and Jiu jitsu. It's been a hell of an undertaking but I'm now 6 weeks out from race day and feeling super nervous, excited and questioning my sanity for trying to do this. 

I've been a lurker on this sub for a while, reading and soaking up as much info as possible on diet, training tips and what to expect. Just wanted to give a thanks to all you unknowing coaches/ fellow runners and looking forward to posting a successful race report in a few weeks.",1598130805

I’m guessing like quite a few other runners I’m bad at doing all the non running stuff runners are supposed to do.

I'm white, get burned easily, and even a regular baseball-type hat is not enough for me, especially if i try to go for a run in the 10-4 timeframe. My face and the back of my neck get crushed if I dare go out mid-day-ish.

Is everyone else naturally sun-resistant?

I'm not doing ultras (yet), but figured y'all would be using them if anyone was.

Also, they don't seem to be sold on various running store sites. It doesn't compute to me.",1598056439
ultrarunning,whitlow_running,Training for 100 miler,This is more or less just looking for someone to commiserate. I’m training for my first hundred which hopefully will go off in November at Tunnel Hill. This will be my highest volume month (did a high volume week and now longer interval training for the last 3 weeks of the month) and my last two runs have felt like straight garbage....I notoriously don’t stretch or do mobility that often (that’s changing now...) and I feel like it’s finally come to bite me in the ass. My legs are just f****** slugs. I guess I shouldn’t expect to feel great the entire time training for a race like this but it’s def the first time that maybe I’m not ready for this has popped into my head.

ultrarunning,thehulkxx,Planning a 100km walk/run tips,"Hi gang,

Myself and a friend are planning on trekking 100km along the Grand Union canal path (UK). A 50km out and 50km back. We will be doing it ourselves, not as a part of any organised event. Looking to finish it in/around 24hrs.

I have a few questions, and also looking for general advice. 

1. Would you start in the evening and walk through the night first or walk through the day first?
2. What food would you eat? How much water? Everything we eat will need to be in our backpacks.
3. Would you suggest breaks or try and keep moving? We were thinking about sitting down and having a proper ""meal"" at the half way mark before we turned back?
4. I'm thinking about wearing hiking boots rather than my running trainers, I think my partner will want to walk more than run. Opinions?
5. Any specific training? I am running a marathon about a month before I plan to walk the 100km, so tips to move from marathon training to walking training in that month?
6. Any other tips!

Thanks!",1597841267
ultrarunning,TylerCAndrews,"""The Witching Hour"" - Throwback Race Report from Dani Moreno at 2019 Trail Worlds","Hey everyone! With so few races around, our group has been publishing some ""throwback"" race reports as a way to get ourselves psyched up and hopefully give the running world something fun to read.

Last week, we published Daniella ""Dani"" Moreno's awesome recap from the 2019 Trail World Championships, where she competed for the US Team in Lisbon, Portugal.

It's a great read - Dani's a great writer as well as a great writer - and she talks a lot about the mental side of the race, particularly in the ""witching hour"" of seemingly bad omens leading up to it. I won't spoil it, but leave the rest here. It's not long.

ultrarunning,Notarunnerbod77,Snotty running forum,"Hi. First ever post here. I joined a local running forum because I'm getting back into running and want to concentrate on long runs. (I signed up for a 50 miler). I post some questions and comments on the forum. I was met with comments that were most certainly intended to keep me on the outside looking in. In hindsight it wasn't an ultrarunning forum. It was a running group. So I came here. I'm not looking to win, intentionally increase my VO2 max, have scholarly talks about running. I just want to be a part of a fun and laid back community. In other words, ultrarunners.

Being her a dietetics students at the University of Applied Sciences for Health Care Professions in Italy, she would need to have a number of filled questionnaires in order to obtain enough information to prepare the thesis needed to get her degree.

The questionnaire takes about 5-8 minutes to be filled in, and anyone with the time (and experience) is welcome to give it a go!   
The questionnaire will be completely anonymous, you just need to set your language and ""complete the task"".

ultrarunning,Redhawkgirl,Does anyone else struggle with carb intake?,I know the science and I need to eat more carbohydrate. Not interested in keto. I find carbs easy at breakfast. Oatmeal and fruit or granola or even bagels no problem. I have a hard time lunch and dinner. I want a big salad for lunch and big protein portions for dinner but at both meals that leaves not enough room for carbs. I probably get around 150 grams and a day when I should get 300. But I struggle to change it. I’m neurotic about veggie intake and seem to crave more protein and fat. Like at night after dinner I try to talk myself into fruit but then I eat yogurt or peanut butter with it and eat more of that then the fruit. I think I have to cut protein and try to eat less fat so I’m hungry for all those carbs. I try to eat what I feel like and after 9am it just isn’t carbs but I know I would perform better and not end up falling apart during big volume training. It matters less right now when I’m not doing big volume but I’m trying to change it. Anyone struggle with this?,1597639225
