ultrarunning,WitheredBallSack,Signed up for an ultra 6 weeks away - help!!,"I am a casual runner but a buddy of mine pushed me into signing up for an ultra-race early November. Fortunately, the race is an 8-hour all-you-can-runathon around an easy 6-mile loop (not technical, minimal hills), so it's pretty much impossible to DNF. I checked the results from last year and probably half the people just walked 1-2 loops while a few got almost 60 miles in before the time limit.

I can currently run 12-miles at a 10:40 pace, that's the longest run I did last week. But there are weeks that go by where I only run 10 miles, other weeks I'll do 40 miles.

So I basically need a 5-week training plan + 1 week taper to prepare for this.

My thought is to start with 35 miles this week.

- Monday: 3 miles 
- Tuesday: 5 miles 
- Wednesday: 5 miles
- Thursday: 5 miles (tempo-ish)
- Friday: Rest
- Saturday: 13 miles
- Sunday: 6 miles

I would increase the Saturday and Sunday runs by 1 mile each week, topping out at 17+10 miles on the final Saturday/Sunday before a 5-day taper.

Does this make sense? Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this.",1632745618
ultrarunning,ck425,Weight loss three weeks out from first Ultra?,"Hi All,

Apologies I wrote this and added a load of context. I've add the question into a tl:dr but left the sprawling context as it might help explain where I'm at fitness and prep wise.

**TL:DR:** Is it worth trying to cut some weight during tapering or is that just going to hurt me?

I'm three weeks out from my first Ultra, Edinburgh Rat Race which is 55km throughout Edinburgh. It's mostly road but there's a small section up into the Pentlands Hills near the start. That's proper hill walking territory but it's all fairly well worn routes and nothing too insane. I've been up there a couple of times and we plan to walk that section since neither me nor the friend I'm running with are experienced trail/fell runners but we've both done plenty of hiking in our time. (As a side tangent my main experience trail/fell running was trying to do a 25 mile charity race through those hills with minimal training and vivobarefoot road shoes, in hindsight I'm not sure how I didn't break myself 😅). 

I started my training a bit late but have caught up ok. It's my first Ultra but I've done a couple of Marathon distances before and plenty of halfs. I also run everyday and was doing 4 miles a day for most of lockdown. So while this has definitely been a huge step up I had a decent base. I'm also doing it with a friend and our aim is just to finish within the 10 hour cutoff. So we're planning to walk large sections (most of the trails in the Pentlands) and take our time. I've also recently become a convert to walk/run/walk as a technique and that's helped massively with distance training.  


Anyway to my actual question. After lockdown I'm the heaviest I've ever been, still slimish but upto \~85kg at 186cm. Some of the gain is muscle but a big chunk is belly fat. I considered trying to trim down earlier in training but I'd just started ADHD meds that suppressed appetite (a new sensation for me!) and figured trying to cut weight while getting used to an artificially low appetite and training hard was too risky. I'm used to them now and only have one more long run next weekend before I taper for two weeks. Would it be worth trying to slim down in that time? Or would any weight loss be more than offset by the performance loss of not getting enough fuel in me to recover and build up glycogen stores?",1632732641

I’m sure this question comes up from time to time, but I’m hoping for some recent experience and stories from those who have been through similar injuries.  

I’m seeing a therapist (and a really good one at that) regularly who is helping me through multiple injuries. I’m on my second fracture of the tibia/fibula, along with a ruptured Achilles tendon on one leg, and the calcaneus on the other.  As great as my therapist has been, 10 months post op, and about 7 months after getting out of a wheelchair, I’m still having daily pain. 

I’ve managed to slowly hike to various places in the Sierra but can barely walk the next day. Has anyone been able to get back to their former performance level?

The progress has been a little frustrating, and the daily pain from normal activities a little taxing. I still can’t run or even do a single legged calf raise. My doc, therapist, and I all know ever injury and person is different and nobody has a crystal ball.  But if you have a great come back story, I’d appreciate hearing how long it took, and your experience.",1632688783

&amp;#x200B;

*(I created a reddit account to post this trip report - apologies in advance for any formatting issues!)*  


Despite the resurgence of ultramarathon races post 2020-season cancellations, venturing out to Killarney to run the full La Cloche Silhouette trail has maintained a constant pull on my running ambitions. La Cloche was the trail that ignited my passion for backpacking, which leant itself to climbing, then to alpinism, to hobby-jogging when climbing gym closed due to the pandemic, to serious ultra-running and racing. Now, having just completed running La Cloche in its entirety, I find myself back where I began, the same yet entirely different.

Running La Cloche felt like the end of an early chapter in my outdoor pursuits; something that remained unfinished before moving on to bigger things. I’ve done my best to recount my experience in hopes that it might inform – or perhaps inspire? – others who seek to do the same.

  
**Trip Report**

Anticipation and angst meant I didn’t hit snooze when my 4 a.m. alarm nagged me out of my sleeping bag. After a cup of coffee, two leftover pancakes from the previous night’s breakfast-for-dinner (highly recommended), and a reluctant shedding of my warm puffy, we started the running watches\* and set out at 4:50 a.m. from George Lake’s campsite 30, fittingly the single farthest point from the eastern trailhead of the La Cloche Silhouette Trail. 

*(\*in a rather pointless attempt at good style, we ran a true loop: campsite to campsite rather than the usual east trailhead to west trailhead loop, adding a few kilometres)* 

We began the trail in a counterclockwise fashion, allowing early egress on day-hiking side trails should any nagging injuries rear their ugly head (such options do not exist after the first third of the trail). The goal was not to gun for a fast completion time, nor the vaunted FKT, but to get it done in good style and get back to camp without allowing misery to completely take over our day. 

Upon starting the trail proper, we immediately had to contend with the difficulty of navigating La Cloche’s characteristic mix of granite slab and deep forest by headlamp. After a brief acclimatization (and some fresh headlight batteries), we were well on our way to the Crack, travelling quickly on reasonably runnable terrain. We arrived at the top of the Crack at sunrise, where we were surprised and disheartened to see a number of hammock campers had spent the night.

The reality of the rest of the trail to come set in once we left the Crack. Terrain and trail conditions suitable to fast travel became a distant memory, replaced by sudden and relentless transitions between steep ascents and descents on generally very rocky, rooted singletrack. The mental concentration required to move quickly on such terrain proved to be the real crux of the day, as the challenge rarely let up from this point onward.

We were granted a short break in the form of a brief portion of runnable double-track on the way to the Silver Peak side trail junction. Feeling strong, adventurous, motivated and a little stupid, we elected in a split second decision to add the Silver Peak side trail to our loop. We ascended, tagged the summit, inhaled a few PB&amp;Js, and descended in well under and hour, and continued our loop. The views at the top were well worth the climb, as was the change of pace from the relentless mental grind of the rugged forest trails. While grateful for the brief diversion, we joked the added elevation might come back to haunt us.

The next 20 kilometres were as beautiful as they were relentless. Dangerously root-y forested sections were punctuated by stunning exposed granite ridges, which offered short glimpses of fast travel. The direct sun on the high slabs was punishing, but we were treated to the occasional refreshing northern gust of wind as we traversed the more exposed parts of the La Cloche high ridge. This section was perhaps most defined by the steep ascent up Moose Pass, where distant trail markers leered at us from above tall sections of exposed granite, with no clear path or direction other than “up”.

As we exited the Hansen Township section and entered Threenarrows, I had my first and thankfully only moment of deep-seated worry, as my outer thighs began threatening to cramp, causing my stride to stiffen. In turn, my now-awkward stride quickly brought on a sharp inner knee pain each time my left foot hit the ground. Thankfully, something in the cocktail of salt pills, ibuprofen and water I nervously sucked back kept the potential injury at bay. The potentially disastrous ramifications of an injury so far into the backcountry were jarring, despite the degree to which we had prepared for such a moment. To be 55 kilometres into an attempt to run the La Cloche loop is to be truly alone, and to be there worrying about injury without true shelter only made the feeling more exposed and sobering. 

The remainder of the run was blissfully uneventful, though our mental fortitude began to give way to regular distance check-ins and the occasional muttered complaint as we closed in on the final 20 kilometres back to camp. As we tired, turn-offs and trail markers were missed, backtracks were more frequent, and morale was tested. The terrain remained too technical to run with any consistency, forcing us to run where possible only to give up after a few hundred meters in favour of a feverish-yet-laboured power hike.

In the final few kilometres, familiar sights and the ever-closer promise of the comfort of our campsite kept the pace quick (or at least it felt quick at the time), and after a quick fist-bump on the bridge that marked the western trailhead, we speed-shuffled back to our distant campsite, quietly cursing our idealized full loop from campsite to campsite idea. We arrived back at camp 16 hours after we left for a total distance of 82.59 kilometres and a total elevation gain of a whopping 3,267 meters.

I can hardly remember eating dinner, and I certainly can’t remember falling asleep.

Yes, I would do it again.

**Thoughts on Gear**

On to the fun stuff. Gear selection for this attempt was subject to much scrutiny, but the final decisions proved to work in a general sense.

VJ Ultras were the shoe of choice for this run, given their ideal balance between cushion and ground feel and their emphasis on grip for potentially slick granite slab, wet roots, and classic Killarney clay-rich mud. They performed admirably – especially on wet terrain – despite my relative lack of experience with them (I had only put 50 kilometres on them prior to La Cloche). 

The Salomon Sense Pro 10 was the vest of choice for this run. A 10 litre capacity vest for an unsupported 80+ kilometre run was certainly a risk, but with careful packing and plenty stored in the front pockets, it proved adequately roomy. Comfort was excellent despite humid, sweaty conditions through a very long day on the trail. I used the standard Solomon soft flasks, topped with dual Salomon XA filters for quick water filtration on trail – this setup was crucial in order to minimize wasted time actively filtering water. I carried a third, empty Salomon soft flask in the main vest pocket to fill and carry through longer sections that were without reasonable expectation of water access, though this proved unnecessary and the third flask was never used.

Layers were simple, and brought to you by a well-timed Patagonia sale: A Patagonia Capilene baselayer, coupled with a (seldom-used) Airshed Pullover for wind and light precipitation. While shorts may not seem like a gear choice worthy of discussion, I should call out Patagonia’s now-discontinued Endless Run hybrid short/tight for stellar all-day comfort and truly excellent pockets. For long efforts like these, the chafe protection and ample storage make them worth the increased weight over a pair of split shorts. Fair warning – they look stupid as heck.

Nutrition was a case of “if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it”. Tailwind, stroopwafels and (caffeinated) Endurance Taps made up the bulk of my calorie intake. A peanut butter &amp; jam (no one likes jelly) sandwich and some salt &amp; vinegar cashews quelled palate fatigue and provided some much needed fat and salt, while a couple Snickers bars ended up being the star of the show – every full day out in the backcountry needs a snack that you actually look forward to consuming.

Safety gear took the form of a Garmin InReach, a single down puffy and Gore-Tex ShakeDry shell (each to be shared if needed), and a well-stocked first aid kit. Shelter was omitted by virtue of the excellent weather forecast, though I am well aware of the increased risk created by this decision.",1632676882
ultrarunning,FlyingSquirrel225,Training Plan Question,"Hi - hope this is not too specific of a question. Long time reader, first time poster -  I am training for my first ever ultra in February (60k) with another potential ultra in December (signed up for 50k but there is a 35k option).

ultrarunning,fire_foot,"Longest long run for first 50k, and hiking translations to running","Hi all, first post here, some questions that I'd really appreciate your help with:

What, would you say, is the minimum longest training run needed for a hilly 50k? Not seriously ‘racing’, but just wanting to get around and have fun as it’ll be my first ultra. On trails such as the one I’ll be racing I am about 14 minutes/mile, so I’m rounding that to 15 minutes and thinking an 8-8.5 hour finish is doable. Longest run so far is 20 miles (on a pretty easy trail), and I've had several 15+ milers on trails like what I will be racing on. 

Obviously, my long training runs take ages. Which I’m totally okay with. But I have three long runs left before I start tapering and I’m not quite hitting my plan so I’m wondering if hitting the marathon distance on a trail is critical or not. Between running and hiking (95% running) I have been around 40mpw for the past couple few months, which I feel like should be higher but oh well. For the next the long runs, I am thinking 22, 24, 26... thoughts?

Also, after my last long run, I will be going on holiday and doing a lot of hiking. I will also still be running (supposed to be around 30-35 miles that week). The hikes will be fairly intense mountain hikes in the northern Appalachians, probably no longer than 12 miles per hike though due to my old dog, but easily 2500-4000' gain. Due to less sunlight, traveling/driving places, being on holiday with boyfriend, hiking a lot, etc., I'm anticipating not being able to hit every single run and wondering how much this will hurt me? I go on holiday on the 10th, my race is on the 30th, so will a) hiking a lot and running some will be a nice way to taper or b) hiking will be nice but I need to hit all my runs?

ultrarunning,atxgossiphound,This community is great - Big thanks to everyone who helped me when I tripped attempting RRR!,"I made my second attempt at Run Rabbit Run 100 last weekend. The race was going well early on. I was generally feeling strong and on my target pace. It was hot in the mountains (low 80s) but I had been training in the heat in Texas all summer, so I thought things were fine.

As I rounded a switchback on the first major descent around mile 13 (just above upper Fish Creek Falls, if you know the course), I stumbled. I extended my leg to catch my balance and - BAM! - my calf seized up and I hit the rocks.

Without missing a beat, a nearby runner stopped to help me out. Once it was sure I was not seriously injured, he gave up a few minutes of his race pushing my foot back and forth to help work out the cramp, all while I'm cursing and moaning in agony (apologies to anyone who heard that echoing across the canyon). Throughout this, *every* runner that passed offered help in the form of salts, blocks, and moral support. Despite it looking like my race was over, everyone was willing to lose a little time or gear to make sure I was OK.

We worked out the worst of the cramp and after a little time sitting on the sidelines I managed to hobble down to the aid station. There, the nurse immediately noticed what was going on and came over and started massaging my calf while other volunteers brought me water and offered food (my stomach was not having food at that point). She spend a good portion of my stay there working it out with me (and the other cramped runners - there was a theme).

After a slow ascent with my muscles right on the edge of another cramp, I spent some more time at the next aid station (Long Lake) getting salts balanced. From there, I committed to see if I could make it.

The next sections were 5 miles of easy climbing up a road followed by 20 miles of downhill. I managed to get back on my target pace and gave it everything I had. Unfortunately, the few hours lost in recovery were the buffer I needed and I came into the midway aid station (Olympian) 5 minutes (!!!) past the cutoff. Even with the accident, I was still two hours ahead of my time from 2019 - a victory for me.

**Words cannot express how grateful I am for everyone's help.  In particular, if you're the guy who stopped and helped me work it out, the nurse and aid station volunteers, or the person who threw blocks at me despite my reluctance to accept, thank you! I would not have continued without your support!**

In hindsight, it's pretty clear that I miscalculated on salts and should have upped the amount as it started to heat up. Live and learn and on to the next one!",1632323026

ultrarunning,Pro_Noobius,Running tights: full length or 3/4?,"For those of you who wear running tights, which do you prefer and why: full length or 3/4? Is it fashion?  Is it warmth? Is it protection? Or compression on targeted areas of the legs? Why do you prefer them over shorts? I’ve always been a shorts man myself. But lately I’ve been looking at getting a pair of tights for the colder morning runs (cold here is around 35*F). I don’t get cold easy so I’m wondering if tights are even necessary.

ultrarunning,justanotheradmin1,Update on my last posts here,"So my last 2 posts here were asking for advice before competing in my first ultra… I was really struggling to train after giving blood and then was getting very nervous the day before I was due to race!

Unbelievably pleased to say I smashed my primary goal, of finishing the race and then beat my secondary goal, of finishing in less than 10 hours! Surprising, with my severe lack of training in the past 3 months.

55km of running with 4000m of elevation gain was definitely out there for someone who had only run a marathon once but I paced it well and exceeded all of my expectations.

Finished in the top 20 of a race where 300ish enter and only half finish!

### Training
I didn't follow a specific training plan or guide. But my weekely runs consisted of Wednesday hills/trails 4-6km, Friday road ~5km+, and easy long slow distances on Sundays with cross training in the gym tuesday and thursday mornings. I tried following a plan to train for this race in prior years, but I ended up getting injured and I really just didn't have it in me to run every single day. So training for this I decided to go at my own pace and actually quite enjoyed all of my runs.

I ended up driving out to the course and did 25km there as a trial run which was the longest distance I had done up to this. Initially I had planned to do 30-32km but the course was far more difficult that I realized. But spending 5+ hours on the course I learned quite a bit about what to expect. 

### Pre-race
In the days leading up to the event my anxiety was at an alltime high which resulted in me getting really poor sleeps. However, come race day, I was absolutely fired up and ready to go.

In my vest I carried two 500ml soft flasks. One with water, the other with Nuun. Stinger waffles, Huma gels, Fruit bars and candy. 

### Race
Conditions looked awful, 30-35 degrees celcius with 50km/hr+ winds or more. But more on that later. 

The first 20km was amazing. The hills are hard but fairly straightforward and there were plenty of relatively flat sections that allowed me to run at a comfortable and relaxed pace. The ~11km and ~16km aid stations were welcome sights but I was not quite desperate for them yet. 

The sun came out around the 20km mark and that’s where things went slowly downhill. 

I left the 23km aid station with 1L of water. The high heat with the harsh winds made hydration a real challenge. The wind feels nice because it kind of makes the heat of the sun feel not so bad, but it is a nasty trick. 

By 25km I was rationing water. One sip per 1km. I didn’t run as much because the more I ran, the more my body demanded water. I was desperate for the next aid station. I switched to technique I called “hiking with confidence”, it’s the walk you do when you’re at the airport kind of late on the way to the gate - but you’re not about to full blown run. 

Between 28-32km I decided to quit but changed my mind a few times. I arrived at the 32k aid station at 6hours 30mins. The wonderful team there dumped a bucket of ice water on my face and that changed everything. Suddenly I felt ready to go and figured I could slam the last 18km in just over 3 hours, but the damage was already done. 

I was still able to eat solids. Putting down a fruit to go bar, waffle, banana or energy gels more or less fine. But after this aid station I couldn’t run anymore. I believe I was just too dehydrated from the last leg. Whenever my heart rate elevated my stomach wanted to purge itself. Finishing today was not longer an option but I figured I could slog my way to the next aid station. 

The last leg I was more or less alone. And one of the sweepers (volunteers making sure nobody was left on the course) came up behind me and we walked it in to the 42k aid station together, it was nice to have some company. 

I was DNF’d at the last aid station at 9hours and 46 minutes. But really there was zero chance of me going back out there had they let me. 

It was the hardest thing I have ever done and I had such a fun time doing it. 


### Post-race

In summary:

Training / preparedness ✅
I felt I was prepared enough to finish. The heat just got to me so bad.

Nutrition ✅.
I was still able to eat solids and had a pretty good variety of foods

Hydration ❌.
More water.

Footwear ❌. 
My Saucony Peregrines ended up not being really all that comfortable after 25km. My left foot was falling asleep so I had to loosen the laces, but that created more movement. Blister city. 

Attitude / Mental health ✅. 
It sucked for sure but I was in high spirits for the most part. Really enjoyed it.

People ✅.
The people that run these races are the nicest people I have ever met. I love being a part of this sport.

Again? ✅. 
Absolutely. I need to finish next year.",1632257938
ultrarunning,Mookid94,Elevation Gain per Week,"Hello!  I’m training for my first ultra at the moment which is in 7 weeks.  The race is 50 miles with 3000 metres/10,000 ft of elevation gain on trail.

### About

BMM is held in June in a park near downtown Black Mountain, NC, on a 3.25 mile runnable trail loop (no, not up in the mountains ala Quest for the Crest, Seven Sisters, etc). After some serious flooding a few years ago the course was altered slightly in 2021, lengthening from 5km to 3.25mi and the start/finish was moved to a better location. No real vert, maybe 100-200ft/lap. There are 6, 12, and 24 hr options.

### Training

I’ve only been running ultra distance for two years with a handful of 50ks and one self-supported 50 miler under my belt. For the buildup for this one, in the spring I raced a 50k in Raleigh and crashed hard in some unexpected (for early April) 80 degree heat. I was huffing it in the last 8-9 miles and vomiting. Not a fun one. I learned a lot from that crash that came in handy for BMM re: heat and nutrition prep. (That’s the point of buildup races, right!) A few weeks later I ran/hiked the Black Mountain Crest Trail out and back (23 miles 8,000ft vert) with a buddy which was a really helpful training run in terms of time on feet + vert. Peak training was between 55-65mpw with weekend moderately long back-to-backs, the last of which was 21 and 17 miles. I was in a positive space coming into the race. Of course there is always a bit of “could I have done more?” but in general I felt ready to roll. My goal for the race was to get between 55-60 miles in these 12 hours and place Top 10. If the weather really broke for us (which, spoiler alert, it did not) my stretch goal was 100k. My bottom-of-the-barrel, wheels-come-off goal was a distance PR (over 50mi). 

### Race
The day was shaping up to be sunny, hot, and humid. I grew up in these mountains and I would describe it as a standard summer day. 80 and sticky. When the gun went off (10am start) many went out fast but I was determined to hang back.

The middle of the day really started to take its toll on the field fairly quickly. Everyone slowed significantly. (What is mentally tricky about looped races like these is that the 6, 12, and 24 hour runners were all on the same loop simultaneously so it was impossible to ‘run off’ other people unless you peeked at their bib. Overall I just tried to ignore others and run my own race. When the 6 hour guys finished it was a lot easier to avoid chasing.) Slowly I was finding a rhythm around the course. 

My plan for our personal aid tent each loop was to ‘blow through’ every time (less than 30 seconds), only stopping for a cold water douse and water refill. Then every 15 miles (3x in the race) I would stop for 3-5 minutes to regroup for a bit and fill up on food. And that’s exactly how it worked out minus one extra 2-3 minute stop I took around mile 20. It was hot out there. Many were commenting their stomachs were struggling. Mine was as well (I had a hard time with gels) but not nearly as much as others, it seemed. My wife was awesome at quickly switching out water bottles, dousing my buff in ice water, ice down the arm sleeves, etc. I’m a lucky man. My 3 little girls were a fun morale boost as well, running 50-100 yards with me out of the aid station each loop and ‘helping’ mom. Looped ultras are a real benefit in this way. Crews are able to stay in the same spot and then we all get into a nice rhythm at each stop that point-to-points can’t do.

Even though I was already feeling pretty good all things considered, it was after 50k/~6hrs was when things started to come together really nicely. I put together some solid laps and gained a few more spots. The lead male dropped with an injury. (Sorry, man!) Roughly mile 40-45 I moved up into 4th but, most importantly, was in a great headspace for the last few hours. As the day cooled off, things continued to click. Even effort, no real low spots. Gels never went down well, but Bugles (yes, shout-out to America’s finger hats), watermelon, and pierogis went down nicely. 

At 52 miles I did a little math on the fly and figured out I could complete two more laps and still get in under 12 hours. Finished in 11:50ish with 58.5 miles. 18 laps.

Shoutout to all the finishers. I yoyo’ed quite a bit with the 24hour female eventual winner and was so impressed with some of the 24 hour folks running what was my 12 hour pace. Great athletes out there, way to go everybody. I would recommend this race to others. Well-organized and a fun environment with all the tents and personal aid stations along the course. And definitely a chance to go for an ultra PB that is still on trail but less technical/vert. 

### Post-race
A) Recovery: was feeling great by Wednesday or Thursday.  Except for a gnarly toenail blister I escaped this race without any issues. (Edit: a few weeks later I aggravated some ITB issues which have persisted) B) Aggressive heat management really helped me out. Even though 80 degrees isn’t exactly western states, I’d learned at the 50k in April that I’m a pretty below-average heat runner and need to be more aggressive than most and not overcook it early. Switching out ice cold buffs and hats and stuffing ice in the buff, sleeves, and belt seemed to do the trick for me. C) Looped courses can be an exciting test if you relish the challenge of ‘figuring out’ a course and want to grow mentally to overcome the monotony. I found it fascinating.

### Gear/eats
Nike Pegasus trail 2 (great for non-tech trail like this though my toes ran out of room towards the end of the race), darn tough socks, some cheap amazon arm sleeves, Garmin 945, petzl iko core for the last 90 minutes in the dark, Naked running belt with Salomon flasks, tailwind, Clif gels, pierogis, bugles, mountain dew, and watermelon.

ultrarunning,Pro_Noobius,Running shorts recommendations please,"I’m breaking into the ultra running world with a 50k in April. I need running shorts recommendations please. 

These are some guidelines: 
1. I don’t want to show off my white hairy legs. I’d prefer something in the 6-9” inseam. 
2. I like the feel of compression. I have big thighs and they rub on the inside. Chafing is an issue. 
3. I sweat ALOT and am very warm blooded so I want something that will wick away any moisture and keep me “cool”. 

I’m not against a compression under and looser over combo. Hopefully you guys have shorts that meet these, or at least most of my guidelines. Thank you in advance.",1631761602

### Training
 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

### Race
 
The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!


The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”


With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 


At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.


I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn’t affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‘move slowly and eat a lot’ strategy would pay off.


As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.


The third lap started well, and I saw another couple of headlamps that were on the back half of the loop which continued to grow my confidence. I was moving well in the rain for the first 20 minutes on the shale paths and asphalt, but then I came to the first climb of the lap. I couldn’t get up the first 10 foot section, as the rain had turned the trail into a slip and slide. After failing to get any traction on the trail for a few tries, I realized the only way up was to hike on the side of the trail, climbing with my hands when necessary. It was still slippery off the trail, but I could make slow progress. As I came over the top of the long, slow climb and into the descent, I realized that running was out of question. I tried to surf down the trail, however I would pick up speed quickly and fell a few times on this first descent alone.


At the bottom of the hill I realized that I had a new problem; my hands were covered in mud and I was running out of places to wipe them off. This meant that eating would be difficult. I tried to eat some of my snacks with some difficulty before deciding to wear my gloves while running. This way the gloves would get dirty, and I could take them off to eat. In practice my hands just got dirty messing around with my gloves so nothing really got solved.


The rest of the loop was a complete slog. The trails were either flooded or so slick it felt like running on ice. Despite moving slower than I had all race, I was using far more energy and was quickly becoming tired. The descents were the toughest part, with multiple falls and butt slides on each one. During one of the falls I tweaked my knee; I knew I could still run with it on solid ground but on the slippery trails it seemed like I was just asking for an injury. 


As the loop came to an end I had made a decision; if the directors had changed to the wet weather course (all gravel and shale) I would finish the race, but if I had to continue to run on trails then I would have to stop. As I came into the aid station I asked about the situation and was given two options: I could either wait around for ~2.5 hours while they collected runners that were stranded on the course and set up the wet weather loop, or I could take a 100 km finish now. My first thought was that a 100 mile race with a 2.5 hour rest didn’t seem very fair (to the race course? I don’t know, I was tired) as I would have time to regain my energy and refuel. Shortly after thinking this I realized that after a break that long I wasn’t sure I would be able to move at all, and I would need to be constantly moving during the break to ensure that my legs didn’t seize up. On top of that I wasn’t sure how my hurt knee would fare either. After a couple minutes of internal debate, I went over to the timing table and let them know I would take a 100 km finish. My final totals were 114.8 km in 21:56, and the race gave me an official 100 km finish (actually 108 km) of 20:07.


I left the timing table and walked through the finish line. I raised my hands and I think someone cheered. It certainly wasn’t the finish I was expecting and it felt incredibly anti-climactic. I was a bit jealous of the 100 km runners that were running down the final stretch triumphantly to scattered cheers. I sat around for a bit, texting the people who were following my race and chatting with runners that were making it back. Stories of people hitching rides in cars, losing equipment or bushwhacking to the closest aid station made me feel a bit better about my own muddy adventure. Once I heard back from my wife and knew I could get into my hotel room, I made the slow, cold 1 km walk back to the hotel.


Overall I’m a little disappointed with the result. I went to Lethbridge to run 100 miles, and have no doubt that had the trails held up I could have done it under the cut-off time. I held back on my second lap in preparation for a third lap I didn’t get to run, so it doesn’t really feel like a true 100 km effort either. On the other hand, running 115 km in my first ultra is something I can be proud of, and I’m excited to use the experience I gained in the future.

ultrarunning,blladnar,Crazy foot issues. Anyone ever see or experience anything like this?,"Yesterday I finished the Teanaway Country 100. After about 40 miles I felt a bubble on the bottom of my heal. It almost felt like I was wearing some nike shoes with the huge bubbles on them.

I checked it out at an aid station and it was so deep that you couldn't even tell there was a blister there. Since there was nothing obvious to do about it I kept running. 

At about mile 60 I noticed this happening on my other foot and the original blister was spreading so it felt like most of my heal was a giant blister.

As the race continued it got worse and worse eventually spreading to the entire bottoms of my feet. The best way I can describe it is like I was wearing socks made out of my own skin. 

On downhills my feet would slide to the front of my ""sock"" and then they'd slide back as soon as the ground evened out. This was, as you can imagine, very uncomfortable. Any uneven ground or rock caused my foot to shift in its own skin, sometimes with extreme pain. At one point I thought my sock had fallen down my ankle into my shoe. It wasn't my sock, it was the skin of my foot rolling up.

Here's a photo. Warning, these feet grossed out the seasoned ultra runners at the finish line.  
https://imgur.com/a/9osyO8V

ultrarunning,Pro_Noobius,First 50k in April 2022,"Every year I try to do something new that challenges my mind and body. In the past, I’ve run a marathon, done an Olympic triathlon, and a 3-day 75 mile backpacking trip. My goal is to eventually do a 50-mile run. 
A little about myself: I’m 42 yrs old, 5’11” 200lbs. I do not have a “runner’s body.” I work for UPS so I have a very active job. I get between 15k-20k steps a day. Right now I can go run 8-10 miles on demand @ about a 10:00 min pace. I’m not a runner that wants to podium. I’m more interested in just doing the best I can and completing the event. I also mountain bike on the weekends. 
With this in mind, I’m looking for advice regarding all aspects of a 50k trail run. Everything from: nutrition during and after the runs (I sweat ALOT and can get headaches if I don’t drink/eat enough; and I don’t ever feel the difference if I eat Gus or gels), training schedules (looking for something that will mesh with my ups job) and clothing (right now I wear basketball shorts and quick dri UA or Nike shirts; because I sweat a lot these can get uncomfortable. I’ve been looking at the Exoskin line of compression wear). I ran my marathon in basketball shorts and ate whatever they had at the aid stations (which I regret). 
It’ll be hard to train daily as I put in about 9-12hrs a day at work. November and December will be nearly impossible to train except on the weekends. Christmas season will be 14hr days. 
I want to start training now so I can slowly build up to April. If I wait until 3 months before the run then I’m afraid that’ll be too much, too quick on my body and I’ll injure myself.

As of now I'm not training for any ultra or trail race or event but hope to once I've got a good base.  

Hoping to either design myself or find an easy online plan that can help me slowly ramp up to a good 30+ miles per week base that mixes all or some of road, trail, speed, slow/long runs, strength, xt, hills/elevation gain, etc.  

Anyone successfully done this before?  Looking for either some tips, easy guidance, or any sort of online training plan that may work well for ultra/trail runners, but is not specific for an event or race.   

Seems most of the online running plans are tailored toward a specific distance event, but I'm hoping for something that focuses more on creating and maintaining a base.

ultrarunning,onward33,UPDATE: Should I withdraw from my 50 miler? (Spoiler - I crushed it),"Hi all, I just wanted to say thanks for all the encouragement. I was feeling really concerned after a very mentally tough 50k race and unexpectedly challenging training block, and I got overwhelming encouragement to go for it in my first 50 miler. My main concern was finishing before the cutoff, and I beat it comfortably by 45 minutes. Not only that, I was on point with my race plan, starting slow, eating like clockwork every 30 minutes, plenty of fluids. I experienced no major lows at all. It could not have gone any better for my first 50. 

Thanks again, and remember that if you're having a tough stretch in training, it never hurts to ask for advice and take extra rest when needed.

ultrarunning,Rallih_,What watch to buy? Restricted budget,"Hi all,

What watch do you recommend for a fellow Ultrarunner to buy? My budget is 300-400€. I would like to pay less. I don't need to fancy functions. I think a battery time is one of the most important in comparison to data.   


I have looked at:  
Garmin Instinct Solar  
My eye caught this due to it looks. The brain due to it's price and battery. I really like it. But - it is missing the VO2 estimation, recovery data etc. I am not sure if this will bother me or not. GPS and wrist HR works good on this model. I will not have to care so much about battery due to its battery saving tweaks when running 12-24 hours runs.  
Price for a new is 235€. An amazing price I would say for a new Garmin watch.

Coros Pace 2  
Battery monster as well, cheap and alot of data. I can get this for 170€, new. What I do not like is it's ecosystem (I do not know anything about it). I don't know so much about how much I can tweak the battery usage. But as I understand I should be able to run 12-24 hours easily. I think it says 30? hours in GPS-mode. Downside is that it's only offered in white. I am not sure I really like that color on my wrist 24/7. Any reviews on this watch here from other ultra runners that are in this ecosystem already?

Suunto Spartan Ultra  
An old Suunto, that I actually already own. It's ok and it has the data I need for running. But yea, the battery starts getting old and I am not really comfortable with the ecosystem and I'm having a bit trouble tweaking the battery to get out more than 16 hours from this when running. That is a big issue for me before next season when running up to 24 hours. But maybe I've missed some settings?  


Is there any other watches that I should look at? And no, an old used Fenix I am not interested of.",1631261903

\### Training

I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

\### Pre-race

Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

\### Race

There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them \~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

\### Post-race

Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

Small injuries and niggles are what have been stopping me from breaking into that marathon/ultra territory and I feel like everytime I try to increase my distances (even when very gradually), I get a small injury which sets me back a week or so. I've been to physios and tried to improve my form a lot but I can't seem to avoid these minor setbacks.

I'm now considering just saying f it and signing up for a trail ultra in November of this year. It's about 60k (3 laps of a course that I'm very familiar with) and around 1500m of elevation. Since I've started taking running seriously, I've known I definitely want to eventually do ultras. So I want to get the first one under my belt soon.

ultrarunning,scrimbibbly,Beginner’s luck and beginner’s misfortune: the Grand Traverse,"September 4th, 2020
Crested Butte to Aspen
40.5 miles

First ultra in the books! Thank you to all those in this sub who helped answer the questions I had along the way. 

The beginning: 
We started the day just before sunrise at 6am, winding our way around the base of Mount Crested Butte with views of the foggy valley below peeking out between Aspen groves. My running partner and I were feeling great, riding high on the energy of race day. We had signed up for the Grand Traverse spur-of-the-moment back in May, inspired by a particularly fun day of trail running. We are not inexperienced runners, but brand new to ultras and both coming off long breaks from running. We had trained hard all summer and were excited to see what we were capable of now that we had finally reached the start line. I knew we were both a bit undertrained given our short training period, but fully believed that we were both capable of finishing. 

Four miles in, my running partner stumbled and tripped, her arms flying out in front of her. I had done the same thing a couple weeks earlier, ending up with a nasty bruise on my knee that had mostly stopped aching in time for race day. I figured she’d be dealing with a nice scrape and bruise too, but nothing she couldn’t run through. She hopped up and turned towards me, and I felt the color leave my face. Instead of blood, I saw the white of fatty tissue and bone. She cried out in shock and stumbled backwards off the trail. A couple that had been just behind us immediately offered their assistance, pulling out a much more equipped med kit than my own. Another runner who happened to be a nurse stepped in to help as well. I was so appreciative for these kind and selfless people who I knew were giving up precious time. Fortunately, we still had service and I contacted race support, figuring out how we could get my friend off the trail and down the nearest road. After our new friends had her wound sufficiently compressed, she and I began a slow journey back the way we had came, towards a trail that would lead us down towards a service road. We were both heartbroken, knowing that the day had ended before it had even really began. We ran into the sweep along the way and explained what had happened and where we were headed. Ten or so minutes later, he appeared back behind us on the trail. “Hey, I just spoke to race support, and they said that you should continue on if you’d like. I can help your friend the rest of the way down.” I looked back and forth between the sweep and my friend. “Go!” she yelled. “Are you sure?” “Yes, go!!” Well, I thought, this is not the way either of us pictured the day, but I had to at least try. I took off back the way we’d came, trying to move as fast as I could while knowing that I risked burning myself out. I was at least 45 minutes behind the last group of runners, and I was going to be cutting it close to making the first cutoff at 11:15am at the top of Star Pass. I had to push the pace, otherwise there was no point in continuing on. I knew I was going to be lucky to pull this off, but I was so grateful for the opportunity to continue and I had to try. 

I only saw one other runner in the span of almost an hour, and my doubts continued to grow. Before the first aid station, a supporter with a giant sombrero and a cowbell cheered me on. “How far behind do you think I am?” I asked. “Don’t worry about that, you just run your own race!” “No really, how far behind am I?” “You just run your own race, this is about you!”  Yikes, I thought. While I did appreciate the sentiment, there was clearly no hope for me. I was too far behind. I kept pushing, finally passing two other women at the first wet stream crossing at Brush Creek just before Aid 1, 9.5 miles in. A handful of other runners were still at the station, and I breathed a small sigh of relief knowing that I was finally starting to catch up. I just had to keep moving forward.

The middle: 
As I left the aid station, the knee I had bruised a couple weeks prior seized up. I limped my way along. Great, I thought. Not even 10 miles in and it’s already giving me problems. There’s no way I can make it if this doesn’t let up. But, sure enough, it loosened back up and I was feeling good again. It stiffened up every time I stopped moving throughout the day, but the pain was always temporary. 

I moved through Death Pass escarpment onto East Brush Creek jeep road, where I slowly began to pass other runners. It wasn’t long before the trail started to slowly ascend towards Star Pass. By this time, I had caught up to the couple that had supplied their med kit and helped take care of my friend. I kept pace just behind them, finally feeling like I had a good chance of making the Star Pass cutoff. I followed them all the way to the top of the pass, making the cutoff with 30 minutes to spare. We chatted for awhile as we descended the pass, and I let them know how thankful we were for their help. I had 2 hours to make it 6 miles to the next cutoff at mile 23.5, the summit of Taylor Pass, and I had regained much of my confidence by this point. I was still feeling strong and had managed to avoid any stomach or feet issues, my two worries. 

I powered through to Taylor Pass, once again arriving 30 minutes before the cutoff. I restocked what I needed to from my drop bag and headed towards Richmond Ridge.  There were no more cutoffs after this. I could see the Maroon Bells just behind another mountain range to my left. I knew I was going to make it. I kicked my hiking muscles into gear and moved up and over Richmond Ridge, realizing part way up that I had just completed my first marathon. 

I rolled in to Aid 4 at mile 29. I had 11 miles to go. I could feel some blisters beginning to form between my big toes. I should have reapplied Aquaphor after the last wet crossing, but it was too late now. I kept moving. I was finally beginning to feel the weight of the day. I moved through much of the next 5 miles alone, finally catching up to some other runners as we got closer to Aid 5. This gave me the motivation I needed to pick up the pace. I was getting so close. 

The end: 
I reached the final aid station at the top of Aspen mountain at 3:30pm. I knew that this final stretch was supposed to be brutal, descending 3,200 feet over five miles. The knowledge that was actually going to cross the finish line spurred me on, and I bombed it downhill as fast a I could without completely destroying my quads or risking a wipe out. At this point, the blisters were finally starting to get to me but it really didn’t matter. I was going to make it. Those 5 miles seemed to keep going and going, and the trail got steeper and steeper to the point where I almost wanted to scoot down on my butt in certain sections. It was the only time during the day where I wished I had poles. 

Finally, I rounded the corner into Ajax Park, almost exactly 10 hours and 30 minutes from when we’d started. My husband, my now patched-up friend, and her boyfriend were awaiting me. My friend and I immediately embraced. It was a bittersweet ending to a journey that we had started together and had planned to end together. I knew I would never have even made it the start line had it not been for her, and I had channeled her throughout the day all the way through to the finish line. I felt so grateful to have made it there and for the incredible support system waiting for me. Fortunately, while she did need plenty of stitches, my friend’s injury didn’t damage any bones or tendons. I know she’ll be back up and running in no time at all, and there will be mountains waiting for her. 

TLDR: Trained hard for the Grand Traverse. Four miles in, I thought both myself and my running partner were both done for thanks to a perfectly placed rock and an unlucky fall. After getting my friend to safety, I was given the opportunity to continue but didn’t know if I could catch up in time to make the cutoffs. Managed to reach the cutoffs in time and make it across the finish line! I know my friend will get her opportunity to do the same.",1631033955

I've been running about 65-70 mpw pretty consistently as part of preparation for an upcoming Ironman (also biking 15 or 16 hours per week and swimming 20k or so per week). Every Sunday I put in a SLOW 4-5 hour long run (25-30 miles), and it's my favorite day of the week. Every time I go out the door it's hard for me to stop. Running far makes me happiest, so I've been thinking about switching from faster, more frequent runs to longer ones two or three days a week; last Sunday I went 28, then I put in 25 on Wednesday. Tomorrow I've got my long brick workout, so I'll run for an hour after a seven-hour bike, and then put in my usual 4-5 hour run on Sunday. Is anybody else distributing their mileage similarly? It seems like most ultramarathoners go that long much less frequently; am I setting myself up for an injury? So far, no niggles to speak of.

ultrarunning,fourandthree,Overtraining at low mileage?,"I sprained my ankle really badly last fall and took a few months off running to actually do my physio exercises, then started building back my base by following a half-marathon training plan, with the intention to use that as my first training block before starting back into my ultra training plan (which starts at around 50km/week) with the eventual goal of a 50M next spring. I've previously used this training plan for a 55km and a 65km race successfully (""success"" defined here as ""finishing without injury,"" not ""smashing course records"").

I was feeling strong and powerful until I hit about 30km/week in July. This was right about the time it got crazy hot and humid here, so I decided to take a few easy weeks, because I could definitely feel myself struggling and my paces were getting slower, along with my HR getting much higher. I did a few weeks of 30km mileage, then took a two-week break due to a vacation (though subbed in lots of paddling and hiking). 

Now, however, fall has hit, the air is crisp, and here I am struggling to run a 10k on relatively flat roads. My legs feel like they're made of lead, and my HR makes me look like I'm an overweight smoker in my 80s instead of a relatively fit 35 y/o (though I acknowledge that since I'm using a wrist sensor this isn't necessarily super-accurate).

Is it possible that I ramped up too fast post-injury? Did I have asymptomatic COVID that damaged my heart? Has some prankster filled my shoes with ball bearings?

I have had a pretty solid training block (averaging 100km per week) but recently my glute has been giving me grief mid-run. After grinding through it several times, I opted to rest this week and have been to see a physio. He reckons it's just *very* tight, so gave me a deep tissue massage, recommended I take some more time off, and try running again in a day or two.

Mentally, I am struggling with the situation and the loss of miles this week. I know that this close to race day, it's near impossible to improve - I constantly tell myself this, but doubt continues to creep in. I guess this is the norm, but some reassurance would be appreciated.

I am also a little anxious that my first couple of runs back are a disaster and there is no improvement. Two weeks on the exercise bike doesn't sound like a great taper to me.

ultrarunning,spon0039,Help with estimating how much water I should bring,"Hi all, I have a question about estimating how much water I should bring with me on a solo 100K I'm planning. Basically, I'm looking at attempting an FKT (unsupported) along a flat rail-to-trail line. The route only has something like 600 ft of vertical gain (gross) over the full distance and will have net elevation loss, so it's quite flat. 

Since this is the first time I'll be attempting this distance without support, I'm wondering how I should estimate my hydration needs. **Are there ways to calculate how much water I'd need per hour or per mile?** I have time to test hydration equations.

A Google search didn't yield reliable information – One blogger recommended 1L per hour, which seemed excessive and would be too much for me to carry. And I can't really go off of any race experience as I often re-fill my flasks at every opportunity as a precaution. 

Some additional details that may help:

* Looking to run later this fall in cooler weather (shooting for highs in the 50s F)
* I'm estimating the run will take me about 12 hours without support
* I regularly run marathon distances with just two 750 ml soft flasks
* Not concerned with nutrition as I have a pretty good grasp of how many calories I need per hour to keep moving

If needed, I could pull off the run and purchase water from one of the towns the route goes through, which would bump the attempt to the self-supported category. This would be okay but I'd like to try and carry it all with me if I can.

I recognize we all have different needs, but I don't really know where to even start with estimations. Should I just triple what I normally take for a 25ish mile run?

- Packing around 3-4k calories, mix of sweet potatoes, pb&amp;j sandwiches, trail mix, gummy bears, protein+granola bars, electrolyte tablets, drink mix. Any other good items to pack and bring? We can also get some real food somewhere in the middle right?

ultrarunning,MrDilkington1,Someone please tell me your story of meniscus repair. How does this affect later in life? I'm afraid I'm going to lose my legs later in life.,"I was a fucking idiot. I increased my milage way too much. Nobody ever told me the price for an injury was a ruined life. I thought it would at max be a year recovery. Not permanent damage. Not a meniscus repair that gives me arthritis, that then needs a knee replacement, that leads to agony and immobility later in life.

I can't fucking believe that this is happening to me.

The doctor thinks it's a meniscus injury. I've been off for 4 months from running. My knees are only getting worse. I fear that the tear is worsening. I'm going to call in to speed up the MRI, because 8 weeks isn't enough. I think the difference between grades of injury, and thus the implications for the rest of my life will be made on these weeks.

Am I never going to return to running again? How the fuck can I?

Any older athletes who had a meniscus injury in their 20s. How are your knees doing?

ultrarunning,pooze12,50 Miler 1 Month Out. Questions on Planning,"Hi everyone, 

Here is what I have planned only including the long runs. I have questions on the two weeks out portion. I know that taper begins roughly two weeks out, but does that mean do a long hard run two weeks out and *then* begin taper? Any advice on how to fill these in would be great. 

5 weeks out: 21 miles with 6k vert &lt;-- \[Completed last weekend\] (40 mile week, but lots of time on feet here)

4 weeks out: 50k w/ 2.5k vert  &lt;-- \[this weekend\] (back up to 50-55 mile week)

3 weeks out: 50k w/7.5k vert  (55-60 mile week)

2 weeks out: ?

1 week out: ?

Race: 52.5 miles w/ 8.5k vert

ultrarunning,Turbogewse,Dehydrated food,"Has anyone experimented with dehydrated food for races when there is very little support? 

I've got a mountain ultra coming up and I'm trying to find the most efficient weight:calorie food, there will only be one minor support point with food so I need to carry pretty much everything. There will be plenty streams to get water from though so I'm wondering if anyone has tried running with dehydrated food that they then hydrate as needed. I know most of the dehydrated camping meals need boiling water but my food standards are pretty low. I'd be fine with munching some semi-hydrated food on the go although I don't know how that would affect my hydration levels.

Any advice or related experiences?

ultrarunning,running_rino,Is this shin splints?,"Around four years ago I suffered an injury to my right leg during a coastal hilly ultra. The pain onset was gradual, but as I was 10 odd mile from the finish I hobbled on and literally limped over the line I real pain. I distinctly remember that the pain was far worse when walking, and seemed to subside when running, hence why I kept running! I ended up in A&amp;E the nex day, told it was not broken, but was in a boot and off work for two weeks. The pain was a few inches above the ankle on the front of my leg, lower shin area. 

Fast forward many years and this injury is a distant memory with many races done since. But this weekend I was 46 miles into another ultra when I felt a instant, yet mild pain in the same place. I knew it was back. Right enough when I stopped running it was worse, and running make it better, but then the subsequent stop was worse. Knowing how this story goes I called it a day and pulled out from the race.

A few days later and I have no pain walking whatsoever, but just three inches above my ankle, just to the right of the bone is area tender when I press with my finger.  When I tense the muscle however, the tenderness dissapears!

It seems pretty strange, and I can't find any information that matches my issue. I am going to see a physio, but due to work that will beatleast three weeks away.

Anyone reading this and know what it may be?",1630337935
ultrarunning,urtlesquirt,Give me your favorite strength routine for BIG downhill running,"Hey folks! I am usually a very cautious runner with regards to racing - I rarely race and when I do I make sure to get in 12-16 weeks of solid training prior. Well, the allure of Ultrasignup was too strong and I just signed up for a 12 hour looped race with 3000 feet of gain per 4 mile lap. It is in 7 weeks and my fitness base is not skewed towards hills. I am totally aware that I am screwed - but the post is not about trying to become a climbing/descending beast in that time span. I am just trying to get in some solid strength training in addition to the amount of vert I can safely fit in to minimize injury risk. I am quite young, so I generally recover from strength and workouts well.

What do you like to incorporate in order to maximize leg strength for descents? The climbing doesn't worry me at all, I am a strong power homer with trekking poles.

ultrarunning,Accomplished_Goat448,The little story of my 50km trail race after 2 months of bad training,"Ok I know a 50km run is barely considered as ultra running, but

I never ran in my life

Did olympic weightlifting as a teen and got good , started breaking local records.

I also got into bodybuilding after and bulked up for 86kg for 177cm

Then i got interested into alpinism and running

My first run session was about 2km in 25 minutes with lot of pain everywhere, still weighing 85kg and with sneaker 

Second session I did 20 kilometers in 2h30 minutes.
It was a flat trail '

Then i got injured 5 months ago.
 Couldnt run nor walk without pain  for 2 months so i stopped everything and dropped weight to 73kg

Then i a ran a little bit, like 10km in 1h30 wich was bad but only because i had weird pain in  my Calf

During the last 3 months, I have never ran more than   5km continuously  because of pain everywhere

One day I managed to run 8km in 40 minutes

Then i took a break to walk in the alps
Only 2 running training here

I was back in town, absolutely no serious training and never Ran more than 15km since my bad 20km run before my big injury. 

i have done 4 or 5 painfull run during this time and injured myself in high tight

But two days ago, after being impressed by killian Jornet, I decided that today I was going to run 50km. 

I still had my thight injury but i felt great 

Ran the 30 kilometers in 3 hours 12 minutes, 

Ran the 41 kilometers in 4 hours 25 minutes

And ran the 50 kilometers in 5 hours 30 minutes with

 two 10 minutes breaks  and multiple 20 seconds breaks 

I felt good, and i could hold the 10 kilometers per hour for hours, but my tight injury Prevented me from doing so, but that's no excuse, I don't think I could have done better. I ran low pace, breathing was easy, everything was good.


But i only took 4 little bottle of 90g of mashed apple  wich represent 20g of carbs per bottle wich is not a lot
. Since i had no running kind of backpack. 

I think I would have needed 200 calories of carbohydrate per hour. 


I really think if i managed to do a 50km run in a OK time without any proper training in just 3 months post  big  injury, I'm on the right path 

And yes, it was a mistake to run this far without proper training or anything. I'm not going to do it again for a while. 

In addition, as I had no water on me, I had to stay close to a tap, which forced me to do trail running on the same trail  circuit for 5 hours. 

And i couldnt run uphill or downhill because of my tight injury, Fortunaly i am near Paris and the highest point is 200m. 
What do you think? If i made mistakes, im sorry, im french.",1630316574

I have a 50 mile ultra in ~1 month. The vert on it is about 6,000 ft. I did a training run yesterday (long run day) which was 21 miles with about 6,000 ft. At the end of it I was dead. The run was three loops up to a peak and I walked the uphills  and ran the downs as much as I could (really no flats). The third loop I could not stay in zone 2, even on the downs. 

My long run before this was 28 miles with 4k vert and I didn't feel nearly as dead. And doubled up the next day for another 10 miles.

I love the pockets and stretchy fabric, but here are two things I’ve noticed and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

1) I am struggling getting it to really dial in fit-wise. Mainly an issue when I use the front two water bottle pockets. That weight seems to make it bounce. I have to really pull the cord to make the chest tight but nothing seems to really settle it in. Based on measurements I am a medium but not far from a small. Wondering about smaller size?

2) even more important, it seems that my favorite running shirts are getting messed up. Specifically the front right chest area. It doesn’t feel abnormal to my hands, but it seems that maybe the rubbing of the material on my shirts is running them raw, so to speak, right behind where the water bottle is. I don’t know if it’s an issue without the front water, but I feel that shouldn’t matter.

## Goals

|B|Finish|*Yes*|

## Training

My qualifying races were from way back in 2017 and 2018 and I wasn't selected when I applied for 2020. Thanks to COVID, I had another chance to be selected in the lottery. I only really started to train for the race when I got in through the lottery in January.

I started with short daily runs in January, but I ramped up to 100km per week by May. I also went to Chamonix for a couple of weeks of proper training and I went hiking in the Alps.

I ran an ""easy"" 80km trial race with 1500m of elevation at the beginning of July, but I had to DNF because of tendinitis below my knee. I didn't want to waste my chance to participate in the CCC, so I dropped my mileage in July and did a bit of hiking in early August to try and make up for it.

Because I don't live anywhere near hills, I ran most mileage on pretty flat paths and roads. 

To give some perspective of my general running fitness, I run 19:30 for 5km and I did one 20km training run with 1300m of gain loss in 3:10.

## Pre-race

Of course, like everyone else in Chamonix, I was shocked and saddened to hear that a fellow runner died on the TDS course. The volunteers do so much to make the courses as safe as possible, but these races are still high in the Alps and can be dangerous. 

I raced the OCC at the UTMB in 2017 and finished in the top 600 out of 2000 starters, so I thought that I could finish the CCC in a similar position or in about 22 hours. My training and fitness was pretty similar. However, I was placed in the final, fifth wave of runners because I effectively don't have an ITRA ranking. This means that to reach my goal of finishing in 22 hours, I would need to pass more than 1,000 people, which is a serious challenge given that the whole race is primarily on steep, mountain single track.

I also had a couple of other disadvantages. My girlfriend was visiting family, so she couldn't be there in person to crew me (Crews are allowed at every big aid station from Lac Champex on). I also picked the wrong shuttle time from Chamonix, so I had to wake up 5 hours before my race started.

Basically, my training, injury status, crew, and sleep were all suboptimal for a race of this magnitude. 

## Race

**Start to Tête de la Tronche - 0km to 9km**

I started about 3/4 back in the last wave or behind roughly 1900 other runners. I did manage to pass a lot of people in the first kilometers of the race. I heard that there can be a long wait for the first climb and I was expecting the worst given that I was starting in the final wave. As expected, I spent a lot of time standing around and not moving - at least 45 minutes. However, this might have been beneficial because when I got to the top I felt fresh, even if I heard others wheezing around me.

**Tête de la Tronche to La Fouly - 9km to 40km**

The next section was downhill, flat and pretty fast, but the huge number of runners meant that it was easy to get caught up in a slowish line. Going uphill to Col Ferret meant another conga line, if not as bad as the first. I passed over 100 people between Col Ferret and Anouvaz alone.

Unfortunately, I was having stomach pain through this section and I was really not eating enough calories. At the first aid station in Bertone at 15km, I felt like I could barely eat and I didn't get much better by Anouvaz. Nevertheless, I passed more than 350 people total from the start when I reached La Fouly on the descent - the equivalent of nearly every single person in front of me in my wave.

**La Fouly to Lac Champex - 40km to 55km**

This downhill section flew by. I passed another 100 people and hit the half way point in 10 hours. In fact, I was only about 30 minutes behind schedule for a 22:00 hour finish at Lac Champex. However, on the short climb up to Lac Champex, I was starting to feel weak.

**Lac Champex to Trient - 55km to 70km**

People started suffering at Lac Champex, me included. I stopped for over 20 minutes here because I felt woozy and I called my girlfriend for moral support before I started the race at night. The continued lack of food caused me to absolutely struggle on the climb up to La Giete. When I finally reach the water station at La Giete, I sat down for another 20 minutes and ate as many calories as I could stomach. The medic came by and asked if I needed help. I was really showing it and quite a few people passed me here. I was now more than an hour behind 22 hour pace. 

Luckily eating gave me enough of a boost to get moving again and I actually passed a few people on the descent to Trient.

**Trient to Vallorcine - 70km to 81km**

I got sucked in at Trient and I stopped 30 minutes without realizing it. I put my headphones in to help distract myself when I left. The climb was still slow and I still wasn't eating enough, but I had convinced myself that it would be gravy once I reached the top. In Vallorcine, as soon as I sat down, my body told me to stop. I spent 20 minutes refueling here again, but I eventually got moving.

**Vallorcine to Chamonix - 83km to 100km**

Food to the rescue again. I got up and started moving toward the last big climb of the race. It's the most technical climb - lots of rocks and very steep. Nevertheless, I passed more people up the climb to Tête au Vents. My legs were absolutely destroyed on the descent down into Chamonix though. My lack of real hill training made it impossible to more than shuffle down the last kilometers from La Flègere into Chamonix. I lost all of the places I gained on the climb up.

The last kilometer in was fun because crowds were already out waiting for the first finishers of the UTMB.

## Post-race

Well, it didn't go as planned but I was more interested in finishing than anything anyway. I also don't have any blisters, black toenails, or new injuries, I just have a regular case of DOMS.

It's true what they say: Ultramarathons are eating competitions with some running thrown in.

I was told it'd be a day off training after the shot but it has turned out to be not quite as peachy and (including the second dose next week, which I've been told will be even worse than the first) I'm looking at 4 of the 6 weeks of peak volume for this year gone down the drain.

What's the recommended way forward when the training plan has been significantly disrupted (Not just a single day when you are unable to train)? Do I continue from where I was pre-vaccine, peak later, then make the off-season shorter and postpone it another year? Ignore the missed weeks and try anyways?

Quickly, my current state is that I ran a few 50k runs in 2019 but nothing further and nothing like that far since. I've done a few 40k runs this year in training but most are 10k. I've probably done no more than 20k a week total training for months (but cycle and gym a lot so not unfit in general)

The 50k is dead flat, easy off road - so.....do I spend the next 2 weeks trying to get some miles in or/and drop a few pounds? I'm around 220lbs so could get down 6 or 7 but can't focus on weight dropping if also doing higher miles.

Lastly, a ""slow"" jog for me is 5m30 km/per hr pace - going slower (when fresh) feels odd - so do I run the 100km by doing my  natural pace and adding in lots of walks to drop the overall average to make it sustainable - or run real slow?

My target is anywhere from 12-14 hrs at a wild guess? My 5k is 19m, my 10k is 42m, full marathon is about 3hr 40 (off road) so I slow over distance (due to weight I expect) my last FLAT 50k was 5hr20 in 2019.",1629962647
ultrarunning,CodonUAG,2021 Tahoe 200 cancelled due to forest fires.,"Received the official notice via email. 

Dear Runners,

We had a long discussion with the USFS today. We have been waiting to hear from them after talks last week in regards to the Caldor Fire and forest closures. They have had several meetings about our event and about closures of National Forests around Lake Tahoe. We are so terribly sorry to say that we have been informed today that the race will not be allowed this year. There is no easy way to say this nor is there any way to lighten the blow. You have trained all year, this is your dream. We realize that you have put a lot into this event. It is a nightmare to have prepared so much and be left with so little. From the bottom of our hearts, we are sorry we could not do any more to make this happen. It is difficult as a racer and as organizers to be at the mercy of nature. This is our passion and we wish we could share it with you this year. 

It's heart wrenching to deliver this terrible news, but we hope that it gives some kind of closure and the opportunity to cancel travel plans or make new ones. After last year's cancellation due to COVID and now this year, we realize that this is two years now that many of you have waited to run this race and two years we have worked hard on our end to make it happen. This race requires a year of work from our entire team. This makes the blow even harder. 

Although we are all devastated to be missing the race this year, our hearts go out to the communities hit by the fire, to the many people who have lost their homes and livelihoods. To the courageous wildland firefighters and forest service risking their lives. As much as we hurt from the cancellation of the race, it can't compare to the losses being suffered by forest fires. Although we regret that the event will not be allowed, we understand that it is important to support the communities as they fight this fire. 

Part of our discussion with the USFS was how to mitigate this fire/smoke issue in future years? Even though last year was cancelled due to COVID, just two weeks later those same forests shut down due to fires as well. That makes two years in a row now that the forests in Tahoe have been closed for fires in September. With the support of the USFS we are planning to move the event permanently to June or early July. Those months are beautiful and green in the Tahoe Basin. Even though June can have lingering snow up high, it's usually mostly clear that time of year and snow does not close entire forests like fires do. Snow can more easily be rerouted around or run through and won't fill the air with dangerous particles. We will keep you informed on new dates and changes as we move forward.

Since hearing about the fire and discussing it with the USFS last week, we have been working on possible reroutes all weekend and week in order to hold the event in the case that it was allowed by local agencies and the smoke was to abate. Unfortunately, no reroutes will be allowed. We want to extend a big thank you to Phil Lowry for working with us on GIS and routes. We had a brilliant plan laid out that took many days and long conversations to develop. We wanted to be completely ready to put it into action if we got the OK from the USFS. 

We wanted to let you know as soon as possible. We will take some time to convene as a team and send you follow up details. We will be mailing out runner swag and merchandise in the next few weeks and we will want to make sure we have an accurate mailing address for you. Please stay tuned for further emails to confirm these items. You can check what address you have on file with Ultrasignup by logging into your ultrasignup account.  

Virtual Option for Racers to Earn their Finish on their Own
We realize it can in no way compare to the read deal Tahoe 200, however, we will be putting together details shortly so that you will still be able to run 200 miles, if you like, and still get your finish. Those who ""finish"" will be mailed their finisher awards. In typical virtual race style, you will pick your route, run it, upload your time and be mailed finisher awards. This will also allow athletes in the Triple Crown to complete the Triple despite the Tahoe 200 cancellation. Submissions will be reviewed and there will be some rules in regards to cut off time and route. We will keep in mind that cut off may need to be more generous as some of you may be running self supported or hillier/more technical routes. We will aim to get this all set up by next week.

Lastly, we want you to know that this decision did not come lightly to the USFS and every possibility we could imagine was explored over the past 6 days. We hope to hold the race in future years pre-fire season so moving to June will be a very positive change. We held the event for 6 years before COVID cancellation with no cancellations. We worry that with what seems like more and more fires in the area in late summer and fall that the September dates seem increasingly risky. We also believe that June or early July will showcase the incredible beauty and wildflowers of Lake Tahoe so that runners can really appreciate the area. 

Thank you for your patience over the past week and now as we work to sort out this emergency cancellation. Thank you for your understanding and kindness.",1629951389

ultrarunning,pascalforget,Stinky running vest?,"Hello all! Last year I purchased a Decathlon Evadict running vest (Trail Running Bag 10 L) that I really love. I let it air dry on a coat hanger after every run.

Everything was fine until a few very sweaty runs on hot days... The vest started to smell bad - like wet old shoes worn without socks.

Today I rinced it, then let it soak for a few hours in water with Lysol Laundry additive (to kill bacterias), then let it dry outside.

It smells better now, but is there some tips and advice to avoid it becomes stinky again? Maybe regular washes in the washing machine (cold water + delicate cycle in a lingerie bag)?

A little background:
I’ve been running consistently since the beginning of 2018, and had a few years of lots of hiking before that. I ran my first road marathon in early in 2019, and a 50k that summer. That was a solid year of training that had good results. 2020 was hit and miss while figuring out shin splint issues and generally running very sporadically. I’ve been consistently running all of 2021 and am currently doing 45-60 MPW training for the 50 miler. 

My ultimate goal has always been to race a 100 miler. My goal is just to finish; I’m not speedy or looking to compete. My idea is to run a 100k around February - April next year, and then the 100 miler mid to late summer (haven’t targeted specific races yet). 

Does it make sense to recover from my October 50 miler, and go straight into another training block for the 100k? And then I can take a concentrated 6 months to prepare for the 100 miler? I’m running more than I ever have now, and just don’t want to overload myself. But I feel with a whole year basically to train I can be in a good position to tackle 100 miles.",1629832979

When I'm fresh, my zone 2 heart rate is around 9:30 a mile, however, my HR increases over time as I get into runs of 10+ miles. I could see my pace bleeding out into \~10:15/mi during the ultra.

I understand everyone is different and this might work for some people, but ever since I bonked at a marathon in my first year of running due to lack of calories, I always make sure I pack as many in as possible before a race.  If time allows I try to eat 2-3 hrs before each race.  I eat chocolate candy bars, pb, hamburgers, breakfast burritos...pretty much whatever my stomach can handle.

ultrarunning,caverunner17,Race Report: Leadville 100,"Race: Leadville 100, August 21-22

Goal: Sub 25 hours

Results: DNF at mile 87.5

Leading up to the race, I had a pretty solid summer. Averaging 70-80 miles/week with double weekend long runs, cumulating with a 30+20 double 4 weeks ago, with the last mile of the 20 in 5:57. I was also averaging 6-8k feet of climbing/week. 

I spent the summer trying out new shoes, clothes, packs, and nutrition, before settling on what I though was a race plan. 

Race day: Didn't sleep much at all (if at all) the night before. Woke up at 2:45, had my usual coffee and a tiny bit of oatmeal with peanut butter and got dropped off at the start line. Race went off. Legs felt a little jello-y from the start, but nothing I didn't think a few mile warmup would solve. 

6 miles in, my race plan fell apart. My nutrition was going to be Tailwind, stroopwafels, clif bars, and a gel during the run legs (depending what I was feeling at the time), and then pretzels and PB&amp;J at aid stations, along with a can of V8 before and after Hope Pass. All of these are things I had practiced eating on my long runs without issues this summer. An hour in, I had my first Stroopwafel, and my stomach started cramping up and feeling like I was going to puke. I got to the May Queen aid station, pulled out a Clif bar.... and the same thing. 

It turned out, my stomach couldn't handle solid foods at all. Improvising, I concentrated on just using Tailwind and the on-course Liquidy Gu gels. 

I got into Outward Bound (23.5) feeling mostly energetic, having run the first portion with a group that was aiming for the 23 hour mark, right around what I wanted. I wasn't overly concerned about nutrition at that point as I had thought I had adapted. 

I made my way into Twin Lakes outbound in 6:59 making some friends along they way -- My jello-y legs weren't feeling any better, or worse, but I could tell that I was getting hungry. My crew pulls out one of the soft pretzels I packed, I had 2 bites, and could barely swallow it. 

Off to Hope Pass I go. I'm not a great climber, but I could immediately feel the lack of energy (though to be fair, it's 40 miles into the race). I make my way up and over and down into Winfield. New this year (COVID), there is no crew or pacers in Winfield. I end up sitting in the station for around 15 minutes trying to refill by bag and drink from the drop bag I sent over. I was convinced to try the Ramen, which seemed to go down OK (ish). 

On the way back up Hope Pass, it started raining and hailing for 10 minutes. As I made my way over, I really regretted not bringing a headlamp. It was getting dark as Hope took way longer than planned. Made it back to Twin Lakes at 8PM, picked up my pacer, then was on the struggle bus. As it turned out, my improvised plan of Twilwind and Gu wasn't working anymore. I was getting sick of all the sugar. Stopping at the Half Pipe aid station, I tried to down a pretzel stick, but immediately started dry heaving. I was really starting to feel the effects of my caloric deficit. Made my way into the Pipeline crew point (72ish miles) feeling really drained and doing the walk-run shuffle. Someone had an idea to try Chocolate Milk -- which worked! My next 4ish miles back into Outward bound felt pretty solid and I was able to run about half of it. Picked up my next pacer and had a solid climb up the first part of Powerline --- then my second wind fell off a cliff. I had been trying to force myself to still take in the Gu's every hour.... but at that point, even they were making me sick and I almost vomited taking in my 3rd one that leg. Making my way down Powerline, I was running numbers -- Assuming I'd get into the last Aid Station at 5:30, that would leave me 4.5 hours to get in the remaining 12.5 miles -- and knowing that most of my later aid station stops were about 8-10 minutes as I tried to scarf down some Ramen, that would make it only 4:20, or roughly 21:00 miles. 

The issue became apparent though that I couldn't maintain that. As we hit the smooth flats and downhills coming off the Powerline climb, I was struggling to maintain 20:00 pace -- then we hit single track, and my pace dropped to 25-27:00 for the last 2 miles. That brought me into the aid station at 5:45ish - meaning that I would only have roughly 4:05 to run 12.5, or needing to maintain roughly 19:00 pace. While that didn't seem horrible, the issue is that there are 6ish miles worth of single track around the lake, which at the same rate of running the last few single track miles, I was going to miss the cutoff by 30-40 minutes. Compounded, I was unable to stomach any additional calories. 

At that point, I was mentally over. Given I had been struggling for almost 10 hours with an ever increasing caloric deficit since the start, couldn't consume any additional food without getting sick and realizing that I would have to have a significant ""3rd wind"" out of nowhere to even make the cut-off time based on the paces I was running the prior miles, I concluded that I was done. 

I cried. 7 months of training thrown out over something that I had zero control over. My last pacer tried to make me go, however I had a simple answer: At no point in the prior 20 miles had I averaged 19:00 pace or faster for more than 2-3 miles straight. To run that pace for 12.5 miles, half of which on somewhat technical single track and have a climb back into Leadville all while not being able to consume any additional calories wasn't going to happen. 

I won't lie - I think this will be my only 100. While I enjoyed many aspects of the race, the long training hours and lost weekends got between myself and my Fiancee, and frankly, to spend all the time, money and hours planning for it, only for something so simple to go wrong really put a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).

While I haven't seen the course, it's ""mostly groomed trails or dirt road"". Would I be able to use my normal running shoes for that?

I’m pretty fit right now and have had excellent training, so that is not the issue here. I am happy and healthy in regard to this race so it isn’t a mental issue. I was also hydrated and well fed starting the race, so that wasn’t it either.

I began the race (my first 100k) feeling good and moving. Right after I heard my watch click signaling the first mile, we went through a few nettles and I felt one get between the tongue of my shoe and the front of my ankle. Rather than ignore it and let it develop into an issue, I stepped to the side of the trail, bent over and removed it real quick. 

As soon as I stood up, my quads seized and cramped like nothing I’d ever experienced before. They swelled, started shaking and I could not walk, let alone run. My friend saw me and tried to help me keep going. He gave me salt to see if it was an electrolyte issue (it didn’t help) and then we tried pain reliever. Then he helped me aggressively massage my calves and pound them to get them to loosen. Nothing helped. I couldn’t sit down without doing a log roll on the ground. I hobbled to the aid station at mile 6 and was pulled off the course. My legs stopped seizing a couple hours later and I was able to move around better.

Today, I feel like I either did a massive leg day gym session or had a long downhill workout. My body and mind still feel fresh, but my quads are still sore. I’m getting the sense that the soreness will resolve in a few days with foam rolling and massage.

Any ideas as to what could have happened? I am still fit so most likely will do a race in a few weeks to get the most of this training cycle. But of all the things I thought would go wrong in this effort, quad cramps at mile 1 was not it.",1629650043

But I’ve been on chemo/immuno drugs for the past ~2 years now, along with a stem cell (aka bone marrow) transplant last year. But throughout working hard to keep my running up when I can. 

It’s hard to find people going through similar experiences and how they adjust and cope. Recovering from the more serious treatment aside (the SCT was about 6 months), the side effects from some of the drugs/drug combinations have played havoc with my max HR, overall HR, oxygen transport/breathing, recovery/sleep … not to mention overheating (even when the weather is cold). Training has had to change (along with my expectations). 

For me I’m managing lenalidomide, daratumuamb, and dexamethasone on a daily/weekly basis. Before all this I was running 3000-4000km per year and have done 15 marathons. Losing all that base was hard but I’m so far back up to over 1000km for the year so far. My easy pace before was around 5:45/km with average HR 140’ish bpm, now ~8:00/km at ~155bpm. Max HR changes depending on drugs and dosage, but can change from ~180bpm to 165bpm over the course of a month. It’s weird.

During the week it is more about time efficiency, it just takes way less time to have the breakfast after my run. For the long run i just have my regular breakfast and then take no nutrition with me. Over time my body has adapted pretty well to the midweek fasted runs and my long run just gets a bit unpleasant towards the end, so i guess i'm still far away from bonking, but i still feel the lack of nutrition.

My rationale would be to improve fat burning and to get a feel for nutritional deficits, to be more sensitive. There is also some research done on this topic, it supposedly enhances the release of interleukin 6 and improves fat burning.

Long story short, I finished my first Ultra (a very technical 80km with 3600m d+) a week ago. It was also my first running race/event since I've been only running for a year and a half (im 25)... and my first time really running in trails.

On one hand, I've worked really hard for nearly a year with this 50 in mind. I'd be pretty disappointed to not try.  I don't want to waste my current fitness since I'm not sure what my long term plans are in running. I can stay on the course after the cutoff and still technically finish, even if I officially DNF. My coach says I'm ""fit enough to go for it"". On the other hand, I don't want to  spend the entire race day stressing about the cutoff which might take a fair amount of enjoyment out of the experience. I also really struggled yesterday on a peak long run and I do not want to feel that shitty during the race. Granted, that run came on the heels of an unusual week. 

I ran my first trail races this year. In February I ran a  marathon with 5500' of vert. I finished with a total time of 5:19:15. In May I ran my first ultra, a 50k with 7500' of vert and I finished with a total time of 7:13:57. In July I ran my 2nd 50k also with about 7k vert,  but a much more challenging course (technically and at elevation) and I finished with a total time of 8:02:02. 

Anyway, yesterday was  discouraging, but I have been working really hard. I would be disappointed to step down from 50 miles, but also proud to complete three 50k's in my first yet of ultra running so I'm struggling to make  the decision and I'm just looking for outside thoughts. 

Here is the race I'm signed up for; I knew it was very challenging for a first 50 but I wanted to challenge myself, I just wonder if I bit off more than I can chew: [https://www.everlongendurance.com/olympic-mountains-50m](https://www.everlongendurance.com/olympic-mountains-50m)",1629387869

ultrarunning,Djootn_,First 100 Mile race,"Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend was my first ever 100mile race. What an experience it was!

I've only been running since June 2019 and ran my first marathon in June 2020.

When I started running I was quite overweight (30kg or 66 pounds) so I needed to shed the weight before running long distances and ramping up the milage.

&amp;#x200B;

The aim for the race was quite ambitious, me and a friend of mine headed out with the aim to run under 24hours. My friend had quite a bit more experience then me with long events (ran 100k and a couple of 50milers before) and my longest distance was 57k and longest time on feet was 8hours.

First hours where amazing, the weather was nice, we were right on pace even a bit faster then we expected and everything felt amazing. The only thing that was bothering me was my stomach didn't feel right but nothing serious. A bit later in the day temperatures increased quite a bit (26° Celsius or 78° Fahrenheit) and I felt it. I became quite hard to keep myself hydrated even with checkpoints every 20k and salt tablets. I sweat quite a lot when I run and the temperature in Belgium hasn't been this high in quite a few weeks.

Still I was feeling great up until 115km. It became dark and we went on the more technical part of the trail. I became very sleepy, couldn't focus anymore and some part I probably closed my eyes because 30meters or so went by without me remembering. My friend was struggling the first few hours but he improved the further the race went en kept me going. 

Then at about 138km there was a technical descent where I lost my friend and had to walk 7km to the next checkpoint where my friend waited for me. From those 7km I don't really remember anything, I was close to sleepwalking probably and It took forever because the terrain was quite technical and my body was really rebelling, stomach issues, legs where shot, feet really hurt etc but I managed to get there. 

Upon arriving at the checkpoint my friend waited for me a bit worried because he didn't expect me to be that far behind. I told him he should carry on without me because the only thing I could manage the last 16k was walking at a slow pace and I probably needed a powernap before I even wanted to set off. He did and really went for it managing to finish the last 16k in less then 2 hours and even ran his fasted km's of the race. I on the other hand slept for 20minutes before setting of and had to walk for a solid 4hours before finishing almost giving in to quit at 158km.

I finished in 28hours and 52 minutes and I am quite proud of it because I have the feeling that it was all I had in me that day! 

It was the hardest, most painful and probably the most fun experience in my life and can't wait to my next race! 

Hope you guys enjoyed this quick summary of my race(it's my first long post on reddit and English is not my native tongue!) If you have any questions feel free to ask! :)

I run with a Salomon Adv Skin 5L - two 500ml flasks and a 2L bladder. I clean and dry on a regular basis, and deep clean/sanitize on an as-needed basis. I've disassembled the bite valves to blast out built up debris. And this has served me well for the last several years...

But my kit is approaching 4 years. The bladder and soft flasks are in excellent conditions, but the valves are not holding seal. The pocket flasks take in air and start to get that 'swish' sound when I run. Worse yet, the bladder actively leaks from the valve at the end of the tube. My shirt gets soaked all the way down to the shorts. This level of water saturation opens the possibility of chafing... especially on my long, long runs.

Apparently Salomon sells replacement valves (though a bit costly TBH).

I started the training plan 10 weeks ago to prepare for the Daytona 100 at the 50k distance during the first week of December. I started the training plan ahead of when I would race and if I followed the plan to a T then I should be racing around November 21st. In the plan Powell uses week 16 for running a marathon distance race but not going all out effort. For me that would be around the end of September. I'm planning on doing the marathon distance around October 23rd instead because there's a convenient race for me to run at that time. 

Is 10/23 too close for a marathon distance to my 50k race date of 12/4? 

Any tips on when to start the taper or how for to go on long runs around October/November since my timing is off from the plan I'm following?

I’ve only ran with the Lazerdry this season and mostly on my long runs. It’s got some pretty bad design issues. The water bladder sleeve is in the main compartment and started to tear when I put my sleeve in it the first time. It’s difficult to get it in and out to refill.

About me: 44F with 25 year history of recreational, middle-of-the-pack road running. 7 marathons (NYC, Chicago x 2, Boston x 3). 
PR’s:
Marathon 4:12 @ Boston
Half 1:55
10K 52:30
5K 23:18

Other possibly pertinent info: 5’6” 130 lb, training with Garmin instinct and Garmin HRM-pro chest strap

Recent backpacking trips evolved into fastpacking trips and ultimately to the realization that I love trail running way more than road running. Fast forward to present day, and my first 50K is 9 weeks away. http://pm2hrultras.com/details/  
My primary goal is to avoid a DNF. My secondary goal is to avoid a DFL finish, and my bonus goal is to finish in a respectable time.
For training, I started off with a modified marathon training program I’ve used before, but with more mileage. Meanwhile, I started reading everything I could find on the subject of ultrarunning/endurance and as a result, totally shifted my training approach from everything I’ve ever known and implemented—tempo runs, speed work, hill workouts and long runs—to 100% zone 2 training, as I soon discovered that I have aerobic deficiency syndrome as described in Training for the Uphill Athlete. And just like the book warns, this training has been frustrating and challenging, since I have been forced to run at what feels like a lethargically slow pace in order to keep my HR in zone 2. I’ve also been binging on the Science of Ultra podcast, and one statement Dr. Bearden made is “Easy runs are still runs; they’re not a shuffling jog.” Yet, in order to stay at or below my AeT, which according to Maffetone’s 180 formula is 136, that’s exactly what I am having to do: a shuffling jog. For example, last weekend, I ran 20 miles on a rail trail—a soft-packed, completely flat trail—and I had to shuffle-jog the whole thing in order to stay in zone 2. My first mile was a 10:44 pace and last mile was a crawling 14:51 pace! It was incredibly challenging to “run” that slowly, not to mention the effect on the ego, as less-fit folks were passing me left and right. My average pace for the whole 20 was 13:07 and average HR was 137. I was able to easily breathe out of my nose the entire 4 hours and 22 minutes. And when I go for trail runs, I am forced to run/walk, run/walk to stay in zone 2. I have so many questions about this approach, but the main three are as follows:
1. With my race being only 9 weeks away, how in the world will I be prepared for a 50K trail race with 3800ft elevation gain if all my training is at a snail’s pace on easy, flat surface? And how will I be prepared to run (or even power hike) the ups at a faster pace than which I am currently training?
2. Another take-home from my reading and research is that zone 2 training allows for a limitless supply of fuel via fat metabolization, and all my training thus far has supported this theory. In fact, I did that 20 mile run on water only and felt surprisingly fine both during and after the run. (I did have Tailwind Rebuild immediately after the run.) Running without taking in calories is a foreign concept to me. For reference, for all my marathon training in the past, I would take in fuel every 45 mins or so on long runs. So when exactly should I start practicing with fuel for a race-day strategy?
3. How will I become a stronger uphill athlete aka trail/ultrarunner if this method of training is keeping me from running any hills at all(due to the fact that my HR jumps past 136 as soon as I start running uphill, so I have been walking all hills)??

I feel like I’m missing something big-picture wise. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice to offer, I would be most appreciative!",1627862125
ultrarunning,rhymeswithvegan,Race Report: White River 50M,"This was my third time running 50 miles but my first time doing it in an organized event. Garmin stats: 49.1 miles (79 km), 9786 feet (2983 m) of gain.    
    

The White River 50 at Crystal Mountain in Washington has boasted big names like Anton Krupicka, Michael Wardian, Scott Jurek, and Sage Canaday. Runners toe the unassuming start line in the shadow of the great Mount Tahoma, the tallest volcano in the Cascade mountain range. I left my house on the island just after two, arriving at the race start as darkness still shrouded the forest in mystery. My hands trembled as I taped my toes and slid them into my socks. I breathed deeply and tried to calm myself, but it was in vain. I knocked back a cup of fireball whiskey and jogged to the start line.     
    

And we were off. The four miles to the first aid station were flat and smooth. The aptly named White River rushed beside us. Runners were silent as we began the first 3000 foot climb up to Little Ranger Peak. I sucked down gels and realized I was low on fluids for this nearly-nine-mile section. Fuck. We topped the 5,000 foot peak and ran along the ridge. I settled behind three friends running together. The woman in front of me was stung by a bee and didn’t even break stride. Bad Ass. The trail was lined with wildflowers as tall as me. The contrast of their green vibrancy against towering trees scarred by fire filled me with wonder and awe. A quick stop at the aid station and then I was alone again. I floated down the descent and into the Buck Creek aid station. The volunteers already had my drop bag in hand as I sauntered in. Now it was time to climb again. I partnered up with a guy running his first ultra, shirtless with a pack. I winced at the thought of the “chaffage” in this humidity. It was muggy and the breathtaking views of the mountain were marred by clouds. And so began the second 3000 foot climb. I chatted with the runner behind me, A. His inexperience showed and my concern for him was a distraction from my own struggles. Mostly, we suffered in silence. The camaraderie was comforting. It was hot and none of the aid stations had ice. In that moment, I would have traded my first born for a glass of ice water. Halfway up the climb, the aid station was a welcome sight. They had ice. They took my pack and filled it with ice water. I told the volunteer I loved him and asked him to marry me. He smiled and said “we’re runners too”. I couldn’t wait for A. When I stopped moving, I was filled with dread from the fervent fatigue, the exhaustion consumed me. I had to keep moving or else I would collapse in a chair and surrender. He caught me soon and I offered words of encouragement. “We’re almost there!”. I knew when I reached the summit of Sun Top at mile 37, I could finish. I felt the relief well up as I saw the cars parked before I saw the aid station tent. I took a deep breath and swallowed the tears. “I’m so happy to see you!” I exclaimed to the volunteers. My drop bag had whiskey and I needed it. I dropped my poles, shared shots with A, and sailed down the buttery smooth descent with elation. I had it in the bag, I thought. I powered through my low during the climb, and it was supposed to be easy from here. It was not. The high quickly faded and I had three more shots of fireball and a rice crispy treat at mile 43. A was ready to be done, so he took off ahead of me and I tried to keep up. But a pounding, all-consuming migraine slowed me to not much more than a stumble. The forest was getting dark as the sun began to sink behind the mountains. The river danced beside me, the breeze cooling the tears on my face. I was stewing in my misery, feeling sorry for myself. My chronic headaches feel like a disability and I was both angry and sad. I sobbed. I couldn’t run even though my body was strong. I felt so betrayed by this vessel of my consciousness. 5 people passed me. Maybe more. I fantasized about coming upon a bear and letting it eat me. For a brief moment, I had enough cell signal to call my husband. He reassured me and told me was proud. He is deployed and I missed him terribly. I missed the comforting hand of my sweet 5 year old daughter, the way she strokes my cheek and tells me everything is okay. How can a small child be so graceful?      
    


When I finally reached the bridge that was just around a bend to the finish line, I sighed with relief. I didn’t realize how fucked up my face looked from all the crying until I saw myself in the mirror later. I crossed the finish line and went straight to my car and sobbed. I was proud and happy to be done but I just needed to get out the tears, ride that wave of emotion. I was mad at myself for being weak. For letting the pain get to me. After living with it for my entire existence, you would think I would be used to it by now. I have headaches 24/7 and have for my entire life. Nothing has helped and a dozen specialists and treatments have been unsuccessful. Ultrarunning is helping me restructure the way I feel about pain and has empowered me. But when the barriers broke down at mile 45, I couldn’t fight it. I let the monster consume me. One day I hope to be stronger so I can look him in the eye and say “I don’t care about you anymore”.    
    


I finished in 13 hours and made the long drive back home. No chafing, no injury, just one small blister on my toe. The next morning, I emptied my drop bags and found A's shirt in the one from Sun Top, where we shared shots of whiskey. I have no recollection of putting it there and frankly have no idea how it got there. I do remember him removing it from his pack and complaining about how heavy it was since it was soaked in sweat. I must have offered to stow it for him. Ultra “brain fog” is definitely a thing.

ultrarunning,moose_truce,Top of Foot Pain for Last 6 Months,"Not looking for medical advice necessarily just want to know if anyone has had any success beating an issue like this. 

In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",1627849232

I was told the following analogy about runners (specifically for the Boston Marathon, but I think it could apply to any race). I am skeptical of the story but I'd like to do my due diligence. I'm using my best Google-fu but still coming up short. I'm looking for stories similar to the analogy described below and any sources or communities you can point me to that might know more.

Here's the analogy:

&gt;You have trained for years to even qualify to run... you have come to Boston... you have started running the race..... and then you realize how hard running a marathon really is. So, at mile 16, you quit. You realize that quitting is so much easier than running and you start to rationalize that quitting was the smart thing to do. But there is a problem, your brother also prepared, came to Boston, and ran the race, and he did not quit. At first, you are ok with him running and finishing the race but quickly the guilt of being a quitter starts to eat away at you. You start to badmouth running and your brother in hopes of alleviating the guilt and now anger you feel towards running.  
Quickly you realize that your old group of friends, who are runners, are not going to buy into your badmouthing of running; so, you gravitate towards other ex-runners who also hate it. Soon you are in an echo chamber... you are all reassuring each other that you are right, you keep saying that running is evil, you all talk about how much easier it is to not go running, and only fools would run a marathon. But every time you see a runner it pricks your conscience and triggers guilt from \[not exercising\], shame from your lifestyle, and anger that they dare find joy in running.  
Soon it becomes your quest not just to not run, but to get other runners to quit running too. You start to blog, tweet, and Facebook about how awful running is, it becomes all-consuming. ...You feed off the running hate-fest of others. For each runner that you can convince to quit will provide you the momentary satisfaction that you are at least not alone in your misery. The longer this cycle continues the less you remember the joy of running with your brother and friends, till the only memories are jaded memories of everyone being rude, and how awful running felt.

I'm trying to find these poor former-runners who are consumed by hatred stemming from their own inadequacy to get their side of the story but despite how vocal they are described to be in this analogy, I'm having some trouble.

I assume as runners yourselves, you are constantly assaulted by these kinds of people who have quit and seem to relentlessly attack your choice to run. Please share your stories.",1627754839

Just moved to southern Oregon Coast. Excited to check out our upcoming race calendar! Less excited to see a weird clump of the few ultra events in \~driving distance coming up all in early October...

* Oct 2nd 50K or 25K
* Oct 3rd 50K (already signed up for this one)
* Oct 9th/10th 25K/50K (same course/organizer)

I almost stupidly/boldly signed up for the 50/50 double on Oct 2nd/3rd. The following weekend popped up in my email just in time to give me second thoughts!

For some context I've done two 50K's this year, plus three other marathon+ length trail runs (two FKTs and a last-one-standing). I was at \~70 mpw for most of the year prior to a relative down July due to moving events, but back up to 50mpw for this week. I'm sure that I could reasonably do a 100K race in October with some more focused training (long runs)... two 50Ks over two days, easier, right?

I should probably be reasonable and skip the Oct 2 event entirely. But if I was to do 50's on the 3rd and 9th... anyone have pertinent experience or advice? Anyone want to smack some sanity back into me? Bring me a beer at the finish line (or halfway point)?

I’m running my first 50 miler on Saturday 7/31 (Pikes Peak Ultra) and the race directors just emailed us warning about storms and to come prepared with the right gear and mindset. While I would MUCH rather run in rain than the heat wave Colorado has been experiencing, I’m very risk adverse when it comes to being out in bad weather and have general anxiety around lightning. They did note that they’ll reroute us to avoid climbing Mt. Rosa (hovers right under 12k feet) if there is lightning, but much of the race is still around 10K feet. 

Am I overthinking/overworrying? I’m physically ready - this email just threw me off a bit. If anyone has any words of wisdom, must-have gear recommendations for storms, or any other tips to not let weather be a big stressor, please let me know! Thanks :)",1627506782
ultrarunning,MrDilkington1,"At the end of my tether with my knee injuries. I'm searching for positive recovery stories because I cannot take it anymore. The uncertainty, the time off. None of the PT's are insightful. I'm not searching for medical advice. Just some support and experience.","I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

Just please someone tell me a positive fuckin story I can relate to...

Thanks if you got this far, sorry for causing your eyes to go into the back of your head too.",1627496452
ultrarunning,blxcklst,Salomon vs Camelbak hydration vests for 6+ hour trail runs?,"I'm looking to buy a hydration vest that can be used with a bladder, for 30+ mile (ideally up to 50/100 mil distances but I've got a 30 mile mountain race in 2 months so primarily for that!) trail runs, usually quite hilly so it's at least 6 hours at a time (my 30 miler will have aid stops every 10 miles but i'd rather be overprepared than under).

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Is there a reason why Camelbak hydration vests aren't that popular, am I missing something? How good are Salomon bladders when used with Adv Skin 5? Do they leak at all?

I'm looking into getting my first vest for trail running and think I've settled for the Salomon Adv Skin 5. But I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to fit. I'm quite a tall lanky guy at 2,05m/6ft 8"" and 90kg/198lbs. My chest measures 101 cm/39.7""  I've got both the M and L to try at home and kinda feel that I'm inbetween sizes. I usually don't do any longer runs in winter so the most layers that I'll have underneath is probably a t-shirt + windjacket. 

Loaded with some clothes in the back and socks in the front the vests fit like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/YfkyniN) Unfortunately I can't fill the bottles if I want to return them. Both fits quite snug but the large it's a tad roomier which makes me worry that it'll bounce around to much. The medium probably won't bounce, but it might be a little tight around the armpits. Will the vest permanently stretch out after a lot of use or will the fit basically stay the same? 

I'd be grateful for any insight on which to choose!

ultrarunning,mskiarski,Has anyone experienced this before? knee pain,"Exactly 2 weeks ago I was playing basketball and played for about 3.5 hours straight. I did not twist my knee or anything when playing and I could have even played longer. Felt fine after basketball until 2.5-3 hours after the session. I felt my knee stiffen up at the back of the knee and in front of the knee. 1-2 hours later when I go to bed the stiffness starts to turn into immense pain, like 10/10 pain and for 3 hours during the night I was literally not able to move my leg because of how much pain I was in. I took an anti inflammatory went to sleep and woke up 3-4 hours later. That immense pain was gone but my entire knee was tender and lost full extension and flexion of the knee joint. when I woke up in the morning, I was able to walk on it fine and put my entire weight on it fine but with that tenderness  and loss of full extension/flexion. The following day, I regained full flexion and extension and the knee was still tender. 6 days after I go to the gym to test it out, and I am able to do single leg squats, lunges with weights lateral jumps and so forth with no problem. The only difference I noticed is that the knee felt weaker than my right knee. 2 weeks after the ""incident"" today, my knee is almost 100% back to normal with just a bit of tednerness to the touch and still does not feel 100% strong like my other knee. I went to the doctor to get the ligaments checked and what not and its all good. I know the tests myself and tried it on my own and everything is good and sturdy.

ultrarunning,Jaha13,"Question: heart rate won't stay below zone 3 at high mileage, but perceived effort is zone 2-ish","Greetings!  I am hoping y'all can offer some insight.  I am training for my first official 50k, and I've done a few marathons/shorter distance in the past.  This is my first time doing structured training and I am doing the 80/20 system, focusing on keeping 80% of my runs in zone 2 based on heart rate.  My race-day goal is to finish in under 6 hours.

Since I began preparing for this race, I've been focusing on total weekly mileage and before this weekend had not run further than about 13 miles in a single training run.

I just ran my first longer run (21 miles) since I began this training regimen.  Up to about mile 12, I kept my heart rate easily in zone 2.  It crept up to zone 3 periodically and I slowed down to bring it down.  

I did a pit stop at mile 11 to use the bathroom and ate half a PB&amp;J.

After about mile 12, my heart rate went up into zone 3 or higher and stayed there.  My perceived effort still felt zone 2-ish though.  By mile 15, I was feeling not as fresh as when I first started but energy levels were good.  But by mile 15 I could not bring my heart rate below zone 3, even when I walked at a completely casual pace.  When I jogged it went up to zone 4.  It remained that way the last 5 miles of the run.  

From an energy level/perceived effort perspective, my run was consistent with my goals.  But the higher heart rate concerned me based on the 80-20 training principals and my goal of maintaining that energy level for another 10 miles.  

I would appreciate any insight from those who have experience with this.  Is that normal?  At that point, should I focus on perceived effort instead of heart rate number?

I don't think my diet affected my heart rate, but I will mention that some of my nutrition I had on the run had caffeine in it.  It was total 100mg of caffeine, which was divided into 6 portions.  I took one portion (1/6th of 100mg) every 40 minutes over the 4 hour run.  I normally drink 200mg of caffeine per day (coffee) and I only had one cup of coffee so far that day, so I don't think the caffeine would have affected my heart rate.

I have just completed a 6 months training cycle concluded by a 100km 6000m elevation race. 

My training is focused on mileage (roughly &gt;95km per week the last 3 months before a race) at low-ish intensity and elevation (as part of my runs + hill repeats). So no speed work or tempo runs.

So it will be a training cycle of 3 months for a shorter distance between training cycles for longer distances.

\- Is it best to follow a training plan for a 1/2 marathon?

\- Or should I maintain my current approach (low intensity mileage), maybe reduce the distance per week and add one or 2 specific sessions per week, and in this case what kind of work is the most efficient for a 1/2 marathon (tempo run, fast intervals, long intervals...)?

ultrarunning,dr_comonad,New shoes causing foot pain?,"This is a bit of a noob question, but I'd love to get some advice.

I'm new to trail running and longer distances. Previously, I had one pair of road running shoes that I loved and wore out after about 800 miles running casually and a several half marathons + training. Then I stopped doing much running for about 5 years once we had kids. I am getting back into running and have been running trails doing runs between 5-25k hoping to get to 50k someday. I've been wearing a pair of a road shoes I bought last year to replace the olds and it's been fine but the trails here have been very muddy and wet and I wanted to 'graduate' to some trail running shoes (only discovered the distinction from watching Ginger Runner). I've been holding off because I don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy shoes, but saw a significant sale at the weekend in a local store and picked up a pair of Asics Sonoma 5 GT-X and Fuji Trabuco 8 both the same size. I thought I got a pretty good fit (tried them in person). My feet were feeling pretty sore after the weekend as I ran 25k on Saturday and the on Sunday I ended up having to walk for a very long time in terrible flat deck shoes. My feet were feeling pretty tired and sore on Monday. Tuesday I took the Sonomas out for short 5k spin. Whilst the extra grip felt amazing compared to running in road shoes (especially going downhill on trails) my right foot (on the top) got really painful and then felt horrible for the rest of the evening. My left foot starting to feel a little weirdly numb (kinda like start of pins and needles) whilst running. Now on Wednesday my right foot feels okay but kinda strained in the tendons on top in a way I've never felt before. I'm wondering if this could be the new shoes (combined with some stress from the weekend walking) and whether this might just be that they need time to 'warm up' / 'stretch out' / whatever to my feet? Is that a thing?

I don't really remember feeling this kind of thing before, but (to my embarrassment) I have only ever bought two pairs of running shoes (seen above). Could it be a sizing issue? If anything they feel a little bit looser than my current shoes, mostly at the heel. There is plenty of space up front (about a thumbs width between my big toe and end). Should I just give them time to wear in or should I try to exchange them (I'm guessing this is not possible since I already wore them... damn)? I'm pretty terrified of getting injured (I had a meniscus issue a few months back that knocked me back and it sucked) but the money thing is an issue.

Any advice appreciated, I'm kinda new to this. I guess till my foot feels better I will rest and just run in the shoes I was running in before which didn't cause any foot noticeable pain (not at 5k distance anyway!) I haven't taken the Fuji Trabuco's out for a spin, but I am hoping they will be different. But maybe I should cut my losses and return those as I haven't worn them out yet (I don't know how different they could be to the Sonomas, they look quite different structurally compared to the Sonomas and they feel a bit more of a snug fit when just wearing them around the house).",1626902130
ultrarunning,fredybotas,Creating apple watch app for runners,"Hello guys,

I am a software engineer who started to run recently. While I was doing my research about running I found out that I should track heart zones during workouts.

I searched for heart zones watchOS tracking apps, tried some, but none of them seemed to suit me well. My requirements were mainly:

* Track heart zone with other workout metrics (distance, bpm, pace, time) in same screen without scrolling, just with glance at my watch.
* Device beeps (vibrations) when passing through zones.
* Support of continuous alert when leaving target zone. Stop beeping when entered target zone again.

As a bonus, few times I wanted to know when sunset occurs as I didn't know if I could take extended route and make it home until sunset. Like some sort of sun pictogram with minutes left, showing 45 mins before sunset.

So I decided to create a watchOS app for myself that will satisfy my needs, which I mentioned earlier. Currently I have working prototype, that I am beta testing by myself. I am planning to add new features, companion iOS app with settings etc.

What is your opinion about the app? Would you use it? What workout app for watchOS do you use now? What features do you miss on those apps?

ultrarunning,landboisteve,Getting used to eating while running,"I'm planning on running my first ultra (50-mile trail race) in Summer 2022. I know a large component of ultrarunning is nutrition.

What's a good strategy for **practicing** nutrition. For example, if I have a 5-mile easy run on Tuesday, should I eat something right before the start of the run and see how the 5 miles goes? That way I could eliminate stuff that gives me stomache issues?

Or should I try foods halfway through my long (10+ mile) runs?

I've got my gels down (Huma gels, pretty much any flavor) but I need to start working on ""real food"".

ultrarunning,EnduranceRunner931,30 Mile Training Run this past weekend - Nutrition and Fluids,"Hey everyone:

I had a 30 miler on the schedule for my training run this weekend.  I live in the Southeastern US where we have the joy of both heat and humidity.  I started at 5:10am in the dark at 72F and 97% humidity.

I kept a slow and steady pace knowing that it was going to warm up quite a bit during the 30 miles.  All went well until about mile 23 when I started cramping in my legs.

I ran a 9.5 mile loop, at the end of each loop, stopped and either changed out bottles or refilled bottles at my car, and continued.  Each loop I carried three 500ml soft flasks and wiped them out each loop.

 

The fluids I took were:

Loop 1: 1L of electrolytes, 500ml of complex carbs (250 cals)  
Loop 2: 1L of complex carbs  (500 cals), 500ml of electrolytes  
Loop3  : 500ml of electrolytes and complex carbs (250 cals), 500ml of complex  carb (250 cals), and 500ml of electrolytes, and I took in 1 gel that was  190 cals with electrolytes around mile 24.x

Every hour I took 2 salt stick chews as well.

In total, including the water I drank at my vehicle, I took in 5L of fluids maybe a tick more.  Yet still cramped, and even more important than that - I lost 11 pounds of water weight during the run.  ELEVEN POUNDS.  


So my question is, for others that are in the hot/humid environments, what is your typical intake goal per hour for fluids.  My goal was 1L per hour, which I fell a little short of, next time I will have 2L of fluids on me for a 9-10 mile loop.  In addition to that, what is your caloric intake goal during an hour (yes, I know everyone is different).  


I have a 50 mile training run on 8/21, and it will still be hot/humid/muggy then, and I am trying to plan better, and stay hydrated better, because I felt miserable for the remainder of the day on Saturday.  


Any experiences in hot/muggy environments are appreciated!",1626812882
ultrarunning,ultracrockett,Badwater 135 underway," The Badwater 135 Ultramarathon in underway (Mon-Wed) across Death Valley to fire-ravaged Mount Whitney Portal, climbing 14,600 feet along the way. The temperature will reach 117 degrees F with pavement temperature around 160 degrees. 

In 1966, Jean Pierre Marquant, an ex-paratrooper from France became the first known person to deliberately attempt to cross Death Valley on foot during the heat of the summer. He accomplished a solo circular route of more than 100 miles that also involved scaling several high peaks.

In 1969, James Burnworth and Stanley Roderfer from San Diego, CA, started the idea of going from the low point (-282 feet) at Badwater, to the top of Mount Whitney (14,505 feet) when they successfully hiked it in two weeks during November. A two-man relay craze started in 1973 as duos sought for the fastest known time. Al Arnold of Walnut Creek, California is credited for accomplishing the first Badwater solo in 1977 to the top of Mt. Whitney in 84 hours.

I finished the ‘run’ (more of a shuffle).

Clearly, I didn’t tear anything, as the pain would have been too much to keep running. Some friends think it’s sciatic nerve inflammation. I’ve been icing it, applying heaps of bengay, and using a Theragun Saturday and Sunday.

My question is: what kind of recovery timeline am I looking at? What should I do or NOT do so I can get back out there quickly? I’m also open to other people’s ideas of what the cause of the pain could be… (one thought is that I was running in new shoes that only had about 20 miles on them)

Last November we ran 60k last November at a 5:46 /km pace. We sort of winged it with the training schedule.

We continued with half marathons for two weeks and then we did the 60km.

Some info about me and my route before I continue:

Planning on running a 50km in late september (probably closer to 48kms), by myself. No official race or anything just wanted to do it off my own back. The run itself is very flat, practically a road run for the most part, only about 300m of elevation over the course of the whole run. This will also be my first 'ultra'

I dont have a time goal or anything, the only metric im going to try and stick to is running around 7:00 minutes per km for most of the run. And if I have to walk some, so be it. I just want to finish it.

I have previously ran a half marathon on only 2 gels, feeling pretty good at the end of it. 

Just wondering if someone more experienced than me can assist me in helping find out what to take on my run based off the info I have given. Could I do the run purely on gels and blocks or will I need real food?

I have been running for about 3 years now. Nothing serious - 5ks, 10k, and half marathons. As a point of reference, my half-marathon PB is 1:54 - nothing spectacular. I'm 5'10"" and 188lbs (on the heavier side). I run about 25mpw, half of that is on the treadmill.

A buddy of mine roped me into running a trail 50-mile race July 2022. I was also thinking of running my first marathon Fall 2022, so I know I need to get to work. This gives me about a year to train for the 50-mile race.

Right now my goal is to lose get to 180lbs by the end of August, and PB the 5k, 10k, and half-marathon - I'm running one of each of those in September/October, all two weeks apart. My training plan peaks at 40mpw.

**Question**: And then what? I'd love to **crush** the 50-mile trail race next summer. But I live in MN where running outside sucks Nov-March. I will still run outside 1-2 times a week to keep my ""outdoor running muscles"" in shape. Unfortunately, the miles are so much easier to do on the treadmill. My idea is:

- Maintain 30-35mpw with at least 10 miles outdoors, even during the MN winter. 
- Spend a lot of time doing squats, deadlifts, core, and other supplementary strength training
- One day a week on an exercise bike to work non-running leg muscles
- Try to get my weight down to 165lbs by next March
- Do a 50-mile training plan from March 2022 - July 2022

I’ve been in PT ever since and have done a couple of 8 milers and a few 7 milers since then, but I want to start building back up to double digit long runs so I can feel more ready to really start ultra training this fall. 

The problem is it’s taking me 2+ hours to run 8 miles (with 1000+ feet of elevation gain). A lot of this is due to the heat (I live in Arizona which is basically a furnace in the summer). I’m spending roughly 12 hours running each week, and that’s only getting me 40-45 MPW.

Ended up using 7 electrolyte tablets though the 100km.


The problem is (I think) this caused me to have GI issues from about the 80km mark meaning I really struggled to get in any fuel for the remaining 20km and caused me to vomit once (with two tactical chunders).


I was wondering if anyone out there had used their sweat tests to dial in their salt/electrolyte needs and if there were any real world reviews. I've tried Web searching but only get results for their products and not the tests themselves. Its around £125 to get the test done and I really want to avoid dropping that money on it if I'm not going to get useable results.


I've got a 100 miler coming up in a couple of months and I don't want to have to rely on the scattergun approach of just forcing in tonnes of salt tabs in the hopes that I'll get the balance right between no cramps/ no GI issues.



Thanks in advance.",1626177990

ultrarunning,sdb_drus,Medical tests to request for cardiovascular issue beyond the basics,"Kind of a specific question but I figured maybe others here have dealt with similar things and can provide insight.

I've been dealing with what seems to be a cardiovascular issue that comes on suddenly during occasional runs (as in a couple times a year, but is now happening more frequently and intensely) and have seen 3-4 different doctors and specialists over the past several years, and they've turned up nothing and haven't been able to help. So I want to request as much testing as possible beyond a blood panel at my next appt with a new doctor. I've already had lung and asthma testing, full allergy panel, ekg, and blood panel - none have turned up any conditions.

A little background: I'm training for a 100-mile race in a couple months and had my most extreme case of this issue this weekend on a long run (~26 miles) at high elevation in the mountains. The elevation, terrain, some fatigue and the heat no doubt all factored in, but nothing about this run was beyond what I'm used too.

The issue (short version): occasionally during runs (not necessarily long or hard runs) I get to a point where my heart rate spikes significantly while going uphill, even at a slow pace on moderate grade. It got to a point this weekend where I had to sit down and lay down on the trail multiple times before continuing on (which has never happened before). Legs and the rest of my body were completely fine, but my heart rate spiked so high and my lungs felt so tight that I couldn't catch a breath, and I felt this overwhelming sleepiness. I felt like I could have gone to sleep right there on the hillside. Other issues were nausea, dizziness, blurry vision and some shakiness in my hands that was fixed by taking some electrolyte tabs.

This is a very condensed version of it, but it's happened several times now and does not seem to be directly related to anything like elevation, training volume, length of run, overall fitness, etc. No doctor has yet turned up anything. Again, not looking for medical advice, diagnoses, etc. I'll be seeing a Dr again and am looking for tests to request related to cardiovascular or other issues related to ultrarunning and training.

TLDR: heart rate spikes significantly occasionally on runs to a point that causes dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, and sleepiness. Not directly related to fitness, type or length of run, or any other factors that I can identify. What medical tests do I request from the Dr beyond blood panel, allergies and asthma?",1626025007

So 6 weeks ago I ran 100km road ultra. I mainly run on trails but due to lack of events I gave this a go. Finished it and was in a bit of pain but nothing major, assumed just normal wear and tear.

A few days later and the pain and uncomfortableness was mostly gone. I ran 10 days after and had to stop after 4 miles due to pain around and in my left knee, (on the left side of it and round to the back of the knee). I’ve been getting physio and they have given my strengthening exercises (single-leg bulgarian split squat, glute bridge walk out and a few others and been doing squats and a few machines in the gym). I don’t seem to have any real improvement as I still can’t run any further and the pain returns if I go over 4 miles. The physio tells me to continue to run 2 or 3 times a week to build it up + the strengthening. Due to lack of improvement..my question is - 

Should I continue to run or would total rest be better?

It is always better to do strengthening work for rehab or would rest be better?

ultrarunning,cutepajamas,Looking for watch to replace dead 735XT,"Hello! 

So, my 735XT died after slightly over a year of use, and of course garmin told me (very politely) to suck it up and buy a new watch. So I'm looking for a watch to replace it, preferably not garmin.

==Things I need (I'm assuming things like GPS tracking, a bunch of basic data fields and so on are already in):

\-48h battery life in GPS mode with HR sensor on (Want to use it for at least 5 years and the battery on these things degrades ridiculously fast. This will let me do \~100 milers 6-7 years from now, which is what I expect the watch to last). I would settle for less if the watch keeps the HR sensor on while charging.

\-Solid construction. The 735 \*looks\* solid but I'm really disappointed on it. I want something that lasts. 

\-Good enough software platform (I know this is a pipe dream, but garmin connect is so unstable that I'll take literally anything else as long as I have a way of transferring my data)

\-Wrist HR sensor (Bonus points if it works better than the one in the 735. The bar is pretty low)

==Nice-to-haves:

\-Multisport. If not I'm OK stopping/starting activities, I don't care about this that much.

\-Inline skating, climbing, other profiles available. On the 735 I had to manually edit all activities that weren't on a very short list every time and it got very annoying very fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of cheesed off at the current state of gps watches, tbh. The only thing that matters is the dang battery life, and whenever they upgrade that they put so many useless gimmicks in the things that the battery drains faster and the watch ends up struggling to last for an entire long run after a year or two. I've been looking at some of them and they put a music player in some models. A FRIGGIN MUSIC PLAYER. Sick of being skinned for a tool I need for training, I wish someone made a basic running watch with a huge-ass battery and zero gimmicks.

It comes only in S/M or M/L and I’ve gone with the smaller one but it’s still slightly too big - figure if I can hook to the top and bottom of the 6x tiny loops on the sternum joint (instead of hooking to the 2 x mid-way loops - which is the only option allowed on the pack ATM due to the hook being immovable) then it might feel more secure and less buoyed out from my upper back as is currently the case

Also - anyone tried to modify this pack yet in terms of a snugger fit for smaller torso ppl ? 

Thanks all!

Oh - and I can offer advice about the Fastpack 25 vs XA25 question 

I bought both to try - S/M in both but the UD pack fits much better than Saloman in this size. However the UD seems to jolt around more than the S. Also - huge design flaw with the UD is that the bladder goes inside the pack meaning that u actually have to unpack the whole bag to refill it! That’s pretty much ruled it out for me - and I’m now about 90% sure I’ll stick with the XA25 despite being a bit too big - and in the hope i can find a way to modify it to better fit without stuffing anything up

Oh other flaw with FP25 is that it has annoying velcro on the main bag closure so yr woollen sleeves or delicate ultra light gear gets snagged on the way in/out 
And it’s front strap storage is awful compared to the XA25

But hat off to UD for making a size that fits a medium sized female body vs Saloman who have (in perhaps a sexist, or at least careless, fashion) made the smallest size too big for most female ultra",1625559532

The race will be held in September and it runs for 67k (or about 40 miles, right?) and it has about 2150 meters of elevation (7000ft, right ?) . I have done a couple of middle-distance races before, in the range from 35k to a trail marathon. Those races usually had pretty much the same amount of elevation as this ultra, so the climbing is not something I'm worried about. The reason I came to reddit for answers is because I'm woefully unprepared. I have spent the last two months studying for Uni, barely leaving the house, ever. I know that the training plans and training schedules for these kind of races take at least 10-12 weeks, and I have 8. In the meantime, I have already singed up for some shorter races (a 35k, a 21k, a 5k, and a vertical K), all of which are trail races, and I intend to use them as training, not flat-out racing. Every single piece of advice would be welcomed, weather it is on weekly mileage, the training intensity, core work, etc. I hope you all are  healthy and enjoying the days out! Thank you!

PS. Can cycling help me prepare?",1625485877

ultrarunning,swampsensei,Exercise-induced hematuria,"Greetings all.

Let's talk about pee for a minute if you don't mind. I hope there are no weird formatting things with this as I am posting on mobile. 

Today, after dropping out of a 50k with significant vert in high temperatures, I experienced what I briefly suspected to be exercise induced hematuria. According to [this article](https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/exerciseinduced-hematuria-va-116.htm), this condition is also called ""runners bladder."" A quick search of the sub finds no discussion of this condition that apparently affects us on the reg.

I discovered this condition during a frantic Google search after the darkest pee of my life. My first thoughts were something serious, but I have no other symptoms and generally feel fine, all things considered. From my understanding, if my kidneys were failing or other serious condition, I would be experiencing dizziness or confusion and likely wouldn't be able to post on reddit or type this up. Until I dove down the dark brown urine rabbit hole, I had never heard of exercise induced hematuria and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this.

For what it's worth, I dropped because I threw up a few times and really didn't feel like gutting out nausea while trudging up the mountain again for the last ten miles. With the coloration of my urine, clearly this was a good decision. If you're curious, I peed only once about an hour and a half into the run and dropped about 6 and a half hours in. My next pee was the dark brown urination about an hour after I dropped. Now, about two hours post initial panic, urine is back to stereotypically healthy color. 

It's much more likely that I am/was just abnormally dehydrated, but, usually, I get a massive headache when I'm severely dehydrated. No headache today plus this is an interesting medical condition I've never heard of that I'm curious about. 

Has anyone experienced exercise induced hematuria? What was it like and how quickly did it clear?",1625362964

ultrarunning,Runderpants37,Hamstring late in a run?,"Curious if any of you have experienced this. About 10-12 miles into my runs, I’ve been dealing with my right hamstring tightening up like crazy. It’s been going on since I experienced major cramping in a 50k in early may (which I did end up completing). Feels achy on my forward drive phase, much worse if I’m going uphill. And the idea of sprinting at that point feels like I’d pull something. I can shorten my stride and be ok. Just did a 17er two days ago but couldn’t have gone much more. 
My question- does something like this strike you as injury or weakness? In other words, is rest what’s needed, or strength training (obv both to some extent)? Feels like it must be weakness because it doesn’t bug me in early miles… yet Just 8 weeks ago I was completing 20+ mile runs regularly without a problem around 8 min/mi pace (so that would pointing to this being injury).

ultrarunning,sumix_fit,Dealing with a DNF at Western States,"Hey all,

First time attempt at WSER over the weekend and it didn't go well.  Looking to vent and maybe get some advice.  Was going OK through mile 45, then it all fell apart for a variety of reasons.  The climb up to Devil's Thumb had me delirious.  I looked at my phone and forgot where I was.  That made me worried for my safety.  

I was worried about that happening again and falling off the trail and dying! Even after ""recovering"" at the aid station at the top of the hill, I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  When I got to the bottom (mile 52) at the next aid station, I sat for about 30 minutes, came very close to dropping because I knew it was a big climb to the next spot. An angel at the aid station convinced me to walk out with her.  

Quickly passed her, made it to Michigan Bluff in the dark, got a pacer, but still couldn't get out of my bad headspace.  Instead of running, I was just complaining and walking.  Made it to Forest hill as they were blowing the airhorn which ended my race.

Looking back, I'm so frustrated.  My legs were fine.  My body was fine.  I still moved through 15 miles and 3 aid stations after mentally quitting at 47.  I absolutely could have made it to Forest hill and onwards, but I just couldn't mentally convince myself to keep going.  Yes, my fear at the time was valid, but I should have been able to move past it eventually.  I was not prepared for the heat &amp; hills of the day.

ultrarunning,RemoteObjective147,"Downhill speed, training and fatigue.","In my build-up to R2R2R (11k ft. of vert) in April I did a lot of vert. Not just hilly runs, but also about a dozen workouts at a continuous 3900 foot climb and descent. At the canyon, my legs started to fail with about two miles left of the final climb. Failure mode wasn't quads...as is often cited as a result of downhill work. My hamstrings cramped up.

The next day (and days) I had no DOMS in my quads, or anywhere else. Just fatigue that took the usual week or so for recovery.

My question is...is the lack of DOMS in my quads some evidence that I trained properly for the downhills? And perhaps also paced them right? The legs gave out more in hamstrings and glutes. But it's always hard to tell what was driving that late-day fatigue.

My 2nd marathon was part of my training. It went really well, but since then, it’s felt a bit of a mental and physical slog. I’m enjoying my runs less, I had a few niggles and injuries leading up 


I don’t do any other fitness work. I am also a trans woman on HRT and have naturally lost a lot of strength. So depletion of strength/tempo plus upping mileage feels like it is making everything mentally and physically harder 


There is a 50 miler in 7 weeks I am tempted to do, and then take a long break, focus on gym work, try something new and try get some of my strength back, with maybe a low weekly mileage of 20 miles a week to stay ticking over

ultrarunning,chocochippy24,Trying to be a more supportive friend to my ultra runner bff,"Hi all, I'm looking for a little advice for how to be a better supportive friend, and/or balance my worry with encouragement! This is about my best friend and roommate.

A little over 2 years ago my roommate M (23F at the time) got into ultra running. Since then she has run 3 official 50ks, a 50 miler, 100k, 24hr race, and she just completed a 12 hr race this last weekend. She has placed in some of these, and done generally well in others. She is a strong runner and very mentally tough, and I'm impressed by her perseverance and general character. She is used to getting called crazy for her interest in ultras, and I have made an effort to understand her and not call her crazy. I have gone to every one of her races and crewed her, and I paced her for a few laps this last weekend. I feel invested in her running and want to see her succeed. I'm a casual runner, never gone more than a half marathon myself.

However, after training for her 50 miler she began struggling with shin splints and has not found a great permanent solution (she has tried PT but doesnt really stick with it). For the last 6ish months she has geared her training back quite a bit, trying to give her legs a break. It seems to have worked, as she ran a marathon, half marathon, and 12hr race (56 mi total) within the last 6 weeks with no shin splints. However, she did NO training for these (no idea how she did well in these races, but happy for her anyway). 

She will be training for a 100 mile race coming up in September, but I am worried for her. I want to believe that she knows her body best, but I have watched her take 6+ ibuprofen on consecutive days when she has runs to try to control the shin splints. She is not totally honest with her coach about the pain because she wants to be strong and push through. 

Over the last few weeks I have started feeling like a nag. I have been discouraging her from signing up for more races in the summer, and I am scared that she will hurt herself again in the training for this 100 mi race. She is inspired by her ability to push past her mental limits, but I'm worried that she is going to find a physical limit she cant push by that will cause lasting damage. 

Sorry for the long post, but I find context here relevant. Do any of you have advice on how to stay supportive? Do I just have to accept that it's her body to push hard, and I'm not responsible for her overtraining? Is there any advice you ever received that made you reconsider overtraining?",1624302495

This theory of mine is strengthened by the fact the pain doesn't seem to be localized, it seems to be inside the knee but across the whole cross section of the knee, which is pretty much where cartilage is.

The knee tracks out of alignment with muscle imbalances and this can cause issues with healing apparently.

How do I diagnose a muscle imbalance between glutes, quads, hamstrings? 

Then once I've diagnosed that, Ill just start doing the proper exercises. So I just need help with figuring out that muscle imbalance.

I know this kinda sounds like asking for medical advice, but as I said before I can't get a PT or doc at the moment.

I love running..more than most things. I've waited all year for  summer and now I can't use it. I'm more angry, sad and depressed than I've been in a long time, and it all started with me just trying to better myself . Please help me fix this problem. Thanks.",1623948625
ultrarunning,martijnk79,Poles yes or no,"So I used poles on my first 100 miles finish. Never been a fan of them but with 6000+ meters of elevation I figured I had to. In the end I really think they made the difference and saved my legs a whole lot.

Now I want to try another 100 miles in a couple of months with a little less elevation (4500m) and I want to do it without poles.

I mean I like poles during climbing. Not only physically but especially mentally. When you have yet another climb and your legs are already very tired it's great that you have some support from your poles. Without poles I don't look forward to climbing, with poles I really don't mind.

However, I do like the 'free running' experience without poles. Have your hands free, especially during descent or technical parts my poles tend to get in my way. Plus the terrain here goes from climb to descent all the time so I really don't have time to constantly retract my poles, put them away and then 5 minutes later I need them again. Also I think poles make you slower overall.

I wonder if people here did long distances with and without poles and could share their experience.",1623938423
ultrarunning,curiousquestioner16,Training and weight gain,"27f Does anyone else experience weight gain during training? I stayed at the same weight while marsthon training, but now that I've started ultra training, I've been gaining weight. 

Yes, I'm eating more (about 2200 cals/day 50%carbs/30%protein/20%fat). This is probably the most I've ever ""allowed"" myself to eat due to past eating disorders. Its really hard to see the weight gain on the scale but still try to rationalize that I need this food for fuel. And obviously, as training intensifies, I'll need to eat more yet. I think my calories will max out around 2500-2600 at peak training mileage. 

I can see that I'm ""softer,"" but my friend says she doesn't really notice it. Ugh, it's such a mental game. Does anyone else experience this? How do you deal with it? I keep fighting to not cut down the calories.",1623927347

ultrarunning,gazzydawg,Looking for help to understand what went wrong during first 50k,"Hey y'all,

This is my first post here and I'm hoping to get some feedback on understanding why my first 50k didn't go as well as I was hoping. I would really appreciate any and all honest feedback!

I ran the War Hammer 50k in central Kentucky on June 12 last week. The course track was a roughly 27k out-and-back for a total of 54k or 33.6 miles and about 4,200 feet of gain and loss. The high temperature for the day was about 86 degrees with 80% humidity for a heat index of about 99 F.

The first 15 miles or so I felt great, and everything was going to plan - I was taking a GU Roctane gel every 30-45 minutes and trying to drink 32 oz water between each aid station (aid stations were at 6 miles and 12 miles). At about 15 miles, I started feeling my calves and groins wanting to cramp - I thought this may have been due to low electrolytes, so I took 2 GU Roctane electrolyte pills and continued. I hit the turn-around in second place after 2 hours and 45 minutes, feeling great in terms of my energy and cardiovascular system, but a bit nervous about the crampy sensations. Actual full-on cramps starting occuring at about mile 19 in my groins and calves, and the heat and humidity became really intense at the same time. This slowed me down significantly, but I came into the aid station at mile 21 in second place with a 10-15 minute lead on third still feeling so-so - like I definitely needed to slow down and get fluids in, but that I would continue running strong after a short break at the station.

This is where things started to go wrong. I took 2 GU pills, 2 shots of pickle juice and drank a small cup of Coke - the latter two I never tried during my training. After about ten minutes at the station, I started walking back on the track, but after about a mile, I got extremely nauseous - stomach hurting so badly that I had to sit down for about 20 minutes, until finally, I puked up every bit of the fluids and calories I put in my stomach at the aid station. It didn't seem like my body absorbed anything from my gut in this window, but I felt significantly better after puking, so I continued on walking the 6 miles to the final aid station. The 32 oz of fluids I had with me was not enough for this distance after purging all the fluids from the last aid station however, and when I tried to get GU's in, these also made me extremely nauseous. The nausea was so painful to the point that my new goal was to simply finish and to not DNF.

Basically no running happened in these 6 miles to the next aid station. Here, a similar situation played out - tried to carefully get some fluids and sugar in, felt extremely nauseous, puked everything up after 15 or 20 minutes. After this, I was actually able to eat a couple bowls of potato chips and drink some water and felt good enough that I set out for the last 6 miles. However, after about a mile, same situation - severe nausea, and symptoms of dehydration or heat exhaustion due to my inability to take in fluids. After a VERY slow 3 or so miles, I puked up everything left in my stomach, and felt marginally better such that I could walk the rest of the way in and finish the race in 9.5 hours.

In my training, I regularly used GU Roctane gels, and never had a hint of nausea from them, and had a multitude of runs in high humidity, but not in the combination of heat and humidity that we were in during this race. I also did not get quite the training I wanted to, due to unexpected life things that came up and multiple injuries that I didn't resolve until about 4 weeks before the race. All my training was on technical, rocky trails with my longest run being 17 miles and 2,000 feet of gain, with 13-15 11-12 mile runs with 800-1500 feet of gain.

If you read this whole thing, thanks! I really appreciate it. Overall, I think the nausea is what destroyed me. Because of the nausea, I was not able to get fluids or calories to absorb from my stomach after about mile 22. What I really want to know is how to learn from this and prevent it, as well as the muscle cramping, from happening in the future. Respiratory and energy-wise I felt great until my stomach started rejecting everything I put in it. Based on the details, do you all have any advice on what I did wrong and how to prevent nausea and cramps in the future? Also, is it possible despite the hot and humid conditions that I could have over-compensated and consumed too much salt? I was thinking this is what could have upset my stomach in the first place, between the salt pills and pickle juice.

TLDR: Ran first 50k, all was going well until about 22 miles in where cramps and major nausea set in. Struggled to walk the last 11 miles of the race due to dehydration and what I suspect was heat exhaustion, because I couldn't keep any food or fluids down whatsoever. All advice appreciated.",1623900752

I will take a Clif bar or 2 in case I need them and there will be well stocked aid stations for extras. I have tried the gels I am using in training and haven’t had any issues (yet…). However, I don’t typically eat or drink during runs except when I was testing the gels so I’m not sure when I should start taking on calories.

ultrarunning,keepitboreal,Rhecovering from Rhabdo - any insight?,"Curious to know if anyone has any knowledge to drop about the outlook for someone recovering from a case of exertional Rhabdomyolysis.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday, after an abnormally busy Spring, I got a little over-excited on my first big day out in the mountains for the season. I had been running a decent amount (60 mpw) but mostly on roads. 35 mountain miles and 18,000 ft of climbing later, I landed myself in the hospital with a case of Rhabdo. I was only in for about 24 hours of IV fluids, and am out now, feeling mostly normal, just a little tired, legs are a little sore, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the proper place to ask questions about this is with my doctor, but doctors tend to be more concerned with things like kidney function than running performance. So my question is this: from a running perspective, what should I expect the recovery to be like? Is it just a matter of waiting until running feels okay and then easing into it based on feel? Or do I need to be super-duper-extra-careful? Or should I expect that all my muscles tissue is dead and returning to running is going to be a slow and discouraging process? I haven't really been able to find a concrete answer to what exactly will happen to my muscles after the enzyme levels return to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

On a related note: After the Rhabdo symptoms go away, do I still benefit from the rather large training stimulus? Or do I miss out on any strengthening because I crossed a certain threshold of destroying my muscles?

I’ve been training pretty hard (I think), 40-45mpw, at least 5,000ft per week, and did a 27 mile run with 4,700ft a month ago, so I thought I could do it.

During my race, I got leg cramps so badly, worse than I’ve ever experienced. I was in pain the whole time and honestly, it took all the enjoyment from the race.

Luckily, I finished at my bare minimum pace I set for myself, but honestly was expecting to do a lot better. I’m actually pretty bummed. 

I tapered my runs and didn’t run for two days before the race. I hydrated, ate typical food, and electrolytes.

I drank a lot of water (two glasses with nuun tablets) before the race. Is overhydrating a thing? I sweated more in the first 10 miles than I think I’ve ever sweat before. The weather was cool and cloudy and not a factor.

I don’t normally take in a ton of electrolytes during running, because I’ve just never felt cramping. Usually cramps are a day later in the form of tight/soreness. This race, I was trying everything they had at the aid stations, pickles, salt tabs, electrolyte mixes. I think they helped me survive, but damn I’m just so upset with myself.

I’m so happy I did the race and I’m really grateful for the opportunity, just feel like I let myself down. I wasn’t sure I wanted to sign up for another ultra after this one (wanted to stick to half marathon trail races for a while), but now I feel I have to, just to prove to myself I can.

ultrarunning,t4feri,"Not-race report: Cold River Loop FKT (Adirondacks, NY)","**Background**

I was a D1 walk-on college runner wayyyy back in 2006, but never really ran seriously in the decade or so prior to COVID shutdowns recently aside from random sign-ups for 10K's here and there that never really means sustained mileage or training. When my preschool (teaching job), gym, and other hobbies all got wiped away in March 2020, though, I figured... why not?

I had some solid enough residual speed from general fitness -- got a 21:XX 5K TT a few months in as well as a 1:53 HM. Aside from some trial-and-error to figure out how the hell to run through the freezing cold and pitch black darkness that defined our Syracuse winter, I kept logging miles and improving at various distance TTs as I rolled into 2021; by April of this year I had an 18:XX 5K, 1:25 HM, and was consistently running 70 miles a week.

Then the ultra bug bit me. I saw a local trail 50K with open spots for the middle of the month, not even two weeks out -- hey, why the hell not. I ran [3:59 in the race](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mtb87r/first_50k_ultra_35930_with_an_asterisk/), but made an early navigation flub and got DQ'd from the results. Still, tons of fun and super happy with the result. The next closest not-waitlisted ultra I could find was over in Long Island in May -- that one turned into a [slower 4:45 over some rough roots and stair stretches but much more successful result at first overall](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/n8ecbh/greenbelt_50k_on_long_island_1st_overall/), earning me free Salomon trail shoes and a chunky plaque. 

As June approached, no nearby races really fit with my schedule, so I turned to the trail descriptions of FKT. I bought a Salomon chest pack and tried it out on an [unsupported marathon-ish length run in the Winona State forest](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/winona-state-forest-ny), with some navigation and new pack hiccups slowing me down a bit from a quicker goal but still doing enough to earn the FKT by just under 15 minutes.

**NY/NE mountains**

I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I was never really a trail *runner*, but I'd done plenty of day hikes, a little backpacking, paved and gravel biking over big mountains, some winter skiing... lots of time up in Mt. Hood and the Cascades. Mountains? Cool, I like mountains.

Then I got to Syracuse. Shortly after moving in, wife and I planned a 3-day trip to NH's White Mountains, one of the seemingly more recommended options in our greater area. And it suuuuuuuuuuucked. Waist high (or worse) rock scrambling defined basically every single substantial climb. When you weren't doing that you were very often walking down a literal creek bed, either dry and made up entirely of basketball-sized rocks, or still full of running water. Gross.

We try a couple Adirondack options, slightly closer to us, and find basically the same thing. Well, shit. I guess we're city people now, with occasional dalliances to small, non-mountainous parks and forests.

**The Cold River Loop**

The breaking point that had both of us saying, *lol fuck no*, to coming back to the Adirondacks actually happened on some of the same trails that made up my FKT attempt last June. I'm pretty sure I thought and said I was never coming back... but... that was before I found out I could have my name published on the internet! Fame, fortune! My wife rolls her eyes when I tell her where and what I'm gonna be doing for my next big run.

Also, the loop skips the mountains themselves -- from what I'm readying it's 29 miles with ballpark 2,500 feet of elevation, divided into three manageable climbs and some smaller rollers. So I won't have rock scrambling... just plenty of little and medium ones. The current fastest time is 5:36, just about 11:30/mile pace -- I figure I can knock an hour or so off that, right? Right?

It's hot as fuck and disgustingly humid in Syracuse the week before my trip up there, but forecast for the trailhead area looks much nicer. I figure out how to mount a 1.5L bladded in my small Salomon pack (on the last FKT I'd used a 1L flask in the back and it sucked to swap/refill mid-run), pick up my usual snacks, buy some 100% DEET spray, and take a vacation day off of teaching to wake up at 5:15 and start my drive up north.

**lol, pace**

The first mile of the day is +290 feet elevation or so -- just about the toughest of the day, but relatively smooth surfaces and fair stuff. I come through in 9:44 and think, OK cool, nice and easy and I can drop down to my long run pace (8:00-8:30) on some of the easier miles. My pack with 2.5L of total fluids and some miscellaneous crap is heavy but fitting comfortably. There's some little rocks, roots, and stream crossings breaking up my flow but I get to \~10K at about 9:30 pace, right around what I'd need to do to beat the current time by a full hour.

Then there's the first big swamp. I tip-toe across branches that other visitors have draped across the muck, losing a minute or two, and then get a sustained climb as a reward afterwards. Next mile split comes in 11:50, hmph. And the trail is starting to get increasingly overgrown -- I'm catching spiderwebs in the face and all sorts of bush and tree branches to the shins and forearms. Hmph.

**Bushwhacking**

And the overgrowth only gets worse when I diverged from the ""main"" mountain ascent route. I keep hoping that the various plants I'm running through are only growing *into* the trail so I can successfully plow through them, which thankfully turns out to be true. But it's still rooted and rocky under the thick brush cover, only now I can't reliably see it -- so on a mostly downhill stretch from mile 12 through 16 I start splitting 12's and 13's, with more power-walking than true running.

I'm staying upright at least, with this cautious approach. Did I mention I'm miles away from cell coverage and I have no idea if anyone else is going to cross through this trail today (or tomorrow, or the next day)? Safety absolutely takes priority over pace. One benefit (well, the only benefit) is that I'm still feeling very fresh -- when the trail does start to clear up a bit, I easily shift back into low 9:00 pace for miles 17 and 18.

**Thou shalt not hurdle at mile 25**

I get to the 2/3rds-point feeling solid enough, but a little bit hungry. My legs and stomach are mad at each other and I'm struggling to eat/drink while running, so I start to run the flat/smooth bits than fuel while walking the overgrown and rock-covered bits. The trail is certainly better now than it was an hour ago, but don't worry -- still plenty of un-runnable stretches to give me time to take in some sustenance.

I start to think about FKT pace for the first time in a while as I get down to 8, 7, 6 miles to go. My run-walk mix is still rattling off miles faster than the average pace of the current leader. I think about a couple of round-number milestones and what I need to do to bring my average pace to under 10:00 for the day (finish the last 10K in 8:55 pace, not happening unless it's somehow on a high school track). OK, sub-5 hours? Maybe with some low 9:XX miles -- the trail is looking better and better now, but I haven't seen another human being in two-plus hours at this point. There's downed trees or large branches every 100 or 200 meters; I try to jump over a very small one and nearly wipe out, and rethink that idea. Carefully stepping over them? Sounds good. No sub-5, though.

**The end**

I get a little morale boost from seeing a hiker with 5K to go, then two more. The last \~1.2 miles is stuff I'd seen at the very start of the day, and I laugh at morning-me thinking that this stretch of trail was the ""bad"" part of the day I should be running conservatively. I register a 5:04:40 and see my glorious Subaru with dry clothes, fresh water, and an internal combustion engine that will (hours later) get me back to a shower and couch. I get pizza slices *and* McDonald's in Tupper Lake, then have an uncomfortable 3.5-hours on my butt in the driver's seat before arriving back home.

In two weeks I've got my last day of preschool teaching for the year, followed by a [last man standing-style ultra](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=79693) local in Syracuse. A week after that we're renting a truck, filling it with all our shit, and moving back to Oregon -- so this jolly FKT adventure was my Adirondack send-off, a nice little *so long and thanks for all the rocks*.

ultrarunning,ajame5,Care to share your running pole wisdom?,"To fit in with the euroboys at UTMB (CCC) this year I've bought myself some cheat sticks as I think they'll be a benefit for the elevation and gradient. It's something I tried years ago and wanted to give another go anyway so now feels like the right time. 

Anyone got any experience training with them and fancies sharing some learned wisdom? 

I've seen mixed reports on training with them: some said don't train too much with them or you won't have the legs but I'm of the opinion that that's wrong. I've used them once so far for a 25km 1500m elev. run and was absolutely dying, so sense says training should be specific to using the poles in the race and the upper body needs to adapt to the extra energy expenditure. 

I've comfortably done many ultras on my legs alone and never struggled so is not really a worry. I wonder if I should just be hammering the pole-specific training at this point?

ultrarunning,nowaythisisunique,Running Leadville 50SR next month and have some questions,"A little about me and my training as it pertains to the questions I’ve got. I’m in the Houston area. I’ve got 5x 50 miles weeks leading up to the taper. Starting training specifically for this race in January with over 650 miles. I’ve trained for marathons in 2019 and early 2020. This is my first Ultra. 

Maybe a question more for sea level dwellers or flat landers, but….

1. Coming from lower elevation, how did you feel at altitude for the race? If you can include # of days you tried to acclimate.

Maybe 1a. How much time do you think it added to your expected average pace/mi.? I’m trying to figure out what a reasonable time would be. It sounds like sub 9:59 finish seems doable on paper and Alger at goal, but looking at previous finishers times from my area, most are around 12hrs. Trying to manage expectations.

2. Any previous finishers can chime in on weather that surprised them? Ie. Cold in the morning and hot in the valleys, and cold at peaks. 

3. How many miles did you do training specifically for previous SR50?

4. How much vert specific training did you do? Either in a parking garage or treadmill. I’m a flat lander and had to use a treadmill. 

Thank you for any thoughtful or helpful replies. I’m anxious, have my doubts but really excited for this race. Most days I feel ready, but on bad run days those bad thoughts creep up. I don’t have anyone local that has attempted this distance, let alone the altitude and elevation to bounce these questions off.",1623351149

Nowhere near the volume I was doing, and only twice a week for now, but running. 

I get to run a very easy 5km tomorrow with a minute of walking every 5 minutes, and it is likely going to be the most enjoyable 5km I can remember running.

### Background
So I started running about 8 years ago, doing a mile on the treadmill a couple of times a week, trying to lose weight. I slowly picked up running more often and further distances, but never anything further than a half marathon.

In 2018 I became interested in alpinism/mountaineering, learned a lot more about training theory and started keep better track of my fitness.

In 2019, I ran my first marathon the Reykjavik Marathon, I followed the [BAA level 3 training program](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/levelthree), mixed in with some of the lessons I learned from mountaineering training. Finishing that marathon was an incredible experience for me, it was such a monumental task, the weeks of following a training plan had added up to something incredible.

I had always been interested in ultras, and knew it was something I wanted and needed in my life. I had a few races I wanted to attempt in 2020, but Covid shut that down. Also, at the time I was located in Boston, and did not have a car, so getting vertical was always a bit tougher on the few trail runs I got out to.

Fast forward to 2021, I moved to the PNW.

### Training
I have read enough research papers, published studies, articles, reddit posts, and books (Training for the Uphill Athlete &amp; Running your First Ultramarathon) that I thought I generally had a good grasp of how to set up my own training plan, especially one that meshes with the flux of my life and can adapt with me.

The second half of 2020 was really bad for my running, but 2021 started strong. I got back into the joy of running, and by mid February I knew I was ready to start training for something bigger. I found a 50K (Ridge Route Ultra) which got moved to June 5th, which would give me ~12 weeks to ramp up training and mileage. I picked up the weekly mileage. From about mid march, I picked it up to 30-40mpw. I would aim to get 3-4 aerobic runs during the week, anywhere between 4-8 miles depending on the day. The weekends were either a trail run, or a long road run. 

April is when things started feeling more serious, I received my 2nd Covid vaccine dose at the beginning of the month and it put me off of running for a couple of days, but I eased back in to it. By mid April I was feeling good, but a bit scared by the distance, I knew I was capable, but I needed to break the mental barrier, on April 25th, I committed to running a road marathon training run (ended up with 26.7mi). I felt pretty good after, I took the few days after to do some easy active recovery runs, never letting my hart rate or pace sneak up, I felt solid. 

Now its May, 1 month to the race, two weeks after my training marathon I knew I needed to get on the idea of back to back long runs, so I did 19 road miles on Saturday, and 11 road miles on Sunday, those sucked quite a bit, but it felt nice to hit 30 miles, and know what tired legs were. I had a training friend who was running a trail marathon (and her first marathon) and she was a bit scared by the distance, so the following weekend, we went out and broke that barrier for her, we ran a trail marathon, making sure to keep it easy. The elevation gain, the heat, and the fact that I had not slept 2 nights prior made it a tough run. 

At this point I get an email from my original ultra, stating they were postponing the race to ""sometime in July."" I was too committed to June 5th, and to a 50k, so I began searching, but decided to run the Trail Marathon with my training partner. But needed something to scare me a bit, something a bit tougher, so I made the personal decision to add on some ""bonus miles"" to the race.

The following week, I added in some intervals and some stair climbing on back to back days, this hit my legs hard, but by the weekend I was back to feeling fresh. I was blown away by generally how well I was recovering, so I went out for another road marathon training run. This one took me through a slightly darker mental place, it felt harder mentally, but still doable. This run really helped make the marathon distance less scary, I know I can do it I just need to push the vertical, this was also the last big week before the taper began.

I dropped my mileage a very slightly for week 1 of a 2 week taper, introducing some hill repeats as my last ""hard"" running effort.

Week 2 of taper, or race week, I climbed Mt St Helens on Tuesday, felt tired on Wednesday, and didnt manage my time wisely on Thursday or Friday, so no more runs were had, Race Day was here.


### Pre-race
Race morning I woke up 2 hours before the race, grabbed a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee from McDonald's (the sandwich might have been a mistake). My girlfriend dropped off my training partner and I at the starting area, we grabbed out shirts and bibs, and hung out in the warm car. I look around, wondering if I overpacked my vest, I brought 1500 calories worth of snacks, 2 liters of water, my trusty Norvan SL, an emergency bivy, and my garmin in reach. The last two items might seem like overkill, but after the incident in China, I felt a few extra grams were more than worth it.

### Race
The race only had 40 participants for the marathon, I figured it would be a bit thin during the race. We get counted down, a few people fly off the line, we are starting up hill, into some snow patches; its cold, windy, and I haven't decided if that breakfast sandwich is going to come out of either end in a mile. 

Normally it takes me 1-3 miles to ""settle in"" to let my breathing, my heart rate, and my legs figure out that we are in this for a while. The first 3 miles gained about 500 feet vertical, not awful by any means, but all of the factors added up to making me wonder if this was a mistake. Mile 3-11 were all generally downhill, but the sandwich sat in my stomach, a constant reminder of a potential mistake. My training partner and I had communicated well in advance that we weren't going to actively run together, if one of us felt better, we had no qualms splitting off. But our paces matched, at mile 7 we talked about how we hadn't ""settled in"" yet and how it was a bit strange. But suddenly things sort of clicked, we picked up 2-3 other friends and made a solid middle pack. 

Mile 12 had a couple of aggressively sharp elevation spikes, this is when I remembered ""trail running is sometimes hiking, and sometimes walking."" Mile 13-16 had us lose over 700 feet, blasting down those hills felt incredible, the high cadence running downhill felt great.

Mile 18 had an aid station where I topped off with about 1 liter of tailwind because I knew the next 9 miles were going to be hot, and a non stop climb.

Our pack of runners all quickly ran out of words and just settled in for the continuous uphill climb, which finally broke with about a quarter mile to spare on the race, all we had left was a nice wide downhill to the finish. We all broke out into a run, and then a sprint to the finish line, crossing it felt amazing. Completing the race, getting back to in person events, cheering on other runners, I missed that. 

But my run wasn't over...

### ""Post""-race
My girlfriend was waiting for me in the parking lot, she was dressed for a run. She offered to put my vest in her car, but I felt that was against the spirit of the unnecessarily contrived goal I was going for. We started running laps around the parking lot, laps that were ~.2 mi. I made a point of not trying to look at pace, distance, or keep track of how many laps we were doing. I looked down at my watch, when I crossed the 30 mile mark, did another lap and that's when I figured out each lap was ~.2mi. those last 5 laps felt so long. I was mentally ready to stop. Finally we approached the car again, I had 31.25 on the watch, broke the 50K and stopped moving for the first time in quite a while. 

It was an incredible journey to get there, I loved everyone and everything it took to get there. Now on to another goal, maybe equally as contrived. A lot of people helped me get to where I was going, but huge thanks to /u/TylerCAndrews you are an incredible athlete and have definitely inspired me to keep pushing harder with running and in the mountains.

I haven't run much since March 2020, due to various reasons including Covid Pandemic. (Ran a full and half marathon in Jan and Feb)

But I am getting back to training by doing alternate days of running and cycling for 1.5 hrs since last two weeks.

Is it possible to train by August 28-29 to participate in a stadium run and aim to run at least 80 kms?  
And what kind of weekly mileage should I focus on?

ultrarunning,sbwithreason,"I did my first 100k on Saturday and I feel awful. How long does it take to get through the ""initial"" recovery phase for these things?","Background: I'm a fairly seasoned 50k+ runner. I have done somewhere between 6-10 50ks, and a couple of supported FKTs around 45 miles in distance. I am competitive at these events, I've placed in the top 3 for my gender at several 50ks and successfully claimed FKTs.

This year I decided to train for a 100 miler and I have been following a training plan pretty religiously since November for that. I've missed maybe 3 runs from the entire training plan since then. I have completed many 75+ mile weeks, long runs over 30 miles, back-to-back long runs etc. The 100k this weekend was my qualifying race.

I knew it would be tough since 100k is the furthest distance I have ever run, but words can't even tell you how crummy I still feel (it's Monday morning now, the race was Saturday). I still pretty much can't walk. My feet are still massively swollen and a couple of major muscle groups in my legs just basically don't work at all. I think I'm going to have to call in sick from work because of how much I'm hobbling. I simultaneously can't do anything but nap/sleep while also getting terrible quality naps/sleep because my heart rate and body temperature are still so elevated (per my health tracking device) and my legs are twitching and throbbing.

Is it normal for your body to just go through the ringer more than ever before once you kind of go beyond that 50 mile mark? Any tips for me other than the obvious stuff? I know it will be a while before I can do anything other than super easy short runs. But I'm trying to survive to the point where even going for a walk sounds possible. Normally by 24 hours after an ultra I can at least walk or go for a recovery bike ride.",1623064814
ultrarunning,haiSOOOOdesu,Walking vs Running (Beginner Query),"Hi all, first some background: I have my first ultra in a couple of weeks at the UK Race to the King. It’s 53 miles over hilly terrain with approx. 5,000 feet of altitude gain. I have been training c. 50 miles per week for a few months and lately have shifted my training away from flat running more towards trails and hills, so I think I should be more or less good to go. I’m shooting for around 9-10 hours, but that is probably too ambitious. My “B” goal is under 12 hours and my “C” goal is avoiding a DNF - quite a wide range given the unknowns involved in a first ultra!

For reference, I have a 1:27 HM PB but haven’t run a competitive marathon before - I started running last year to cope with lockdowns like many others I’m sure! My longest training run (or any run) so far is 22 miles, but I am planning to do 30 miles today as my final long run before tapering for the race.

As the race as drawn nearer, I have been researching ultra running a bit more and noticed that a lot of resources recommend walking uphill sections to save your legs/lungs. In my training I have tried to avoid this other than for scheduled walking/eating “breaks” or if my heart rate has really spiked. 

My questions are: if I am shooting for the best time that I am capable of (whatever than may be), should I be walking the hills to save my legs? Should I walk the initial hills to save my legs for later? Or am I ok sticking to the approach I have been using in training (walk only when needed for food/drink or to settle a heart rate spike)?

To explain a little, in general rhabdo is system wide muscle breakdown but different from typical muscle soreness. In extreme cases it can cause bruises and kidney damage (marked by dark urine or peeing blood). Mine never gets that far. After about 60 miles I experience full body pain on impact while running. It will get worse the longer I run, does not respond to ibeprophen,  but will be completely gone the next day. My doctor (okay, husband/ doctor) has generally diagnosed me with mild rhabdo. At first I thought I was under trained for the distances I was attempting but this year I'm much much stronger and still seem to be experiencing the same pain levels at the same distances. I can find very little in the literature having to do with endurance athletes 

I ran a 100 miler last weekend and was unable to run the last 20 miles but my quads, hamstrings, calves never even got sore the way they do if I run a hard effort 50k.

The whole race I felt terrible. Really achy legs / feet and my hear rate keep spiking to 170 even when I was walking at the end. I felt like I had already ran 30 miles by mile 10. By mile 17 I decided I would DNF at the next aid station and the next and 4 more miles of mostly walking I ended the race at 21 miles.

I think it was a mixture of not being acclimated to humidity, not drinking enough and just maybe having a bad day.

I ran a 25K the week before with more elevation at an average pace of 8:15 per mile and felt amazing

This DNF has really took a huge chuck out of my confidence. While at the time I really felt like I couldn't go any further I can't help but think I just didn't try hard enough and I could of pushed through it. I'm now second guessing my 100 miler in November.

**Where Can I Hire a Hacker to Change Grades?** 

So which brings us to the main question — Can you hire a hacker to change your grades? Yes, it is possible to hire a hacker to change your university grades and college grades. It has been done time and time again. It mainly depends on the kind of security behind your school’s system.

I had a personal experience when I was in college, I accidentally “hacked” my grade book system. On my grade book, if you clicked a teacher’s name, it would show you basic demographic information about that teacher, which was all supposed to be public. This included their work email address, to which student emails were supposed to be directed, so I frequently used it to verify that I was sending emails to the correct address.

One day, I was trying to email a teacher, and wanted to verify that I had the right email address. I opened my grade book, and logged in using the password that my browser had remembered, but it occurred to me that I had completely forgotten what that password actually was.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your University Grades**

So, I went to this teacher demographic page, and verified the email address. Afterwards, I decided to go to my own profile page to see if I could find or change my password. When I went to my profile, I noticed that, instead of my name, it said the name of the teacher whose demographic page I had just checked. And near the bottom of the page, it had a password box with the teacher’s password.

From a computer security perspective, like almost every website where you log in and out, I would assume this website had a variable which stored the name of the logged-in user. However, this was the same variable as the one that stored the name of the teacher when you went to look at demographic information.

Then, when you go to your profile, it just accesses the information of whoever is stored in the “user” variable, without using any encoded session ID or token or anything to verify that the value of the “user” variable was actually the user who had logged in. To this day, I cannot believe how awful that security was. At that age, I didn’t know any of that and had never looked at computer code before, otherwise I would have experimented to find the flaw.

**Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades on College / University Transcript**

A few days later, the teacher went over to me to brag that he had fixed it (I think he was under the impression that I had intentionally found the exploit as a white-hack or something). The layout was changed and the teacher demographic page was removed. The next year, we switched to a completely new grade book system.

I’ve never heard of any grade book with such poor security standards, but there have been cases where students have hacked grade books and changed grades. These include placing a key logger on campus computers, phishing the teachers, befriending teachers and getting passwords, finding passwords on unattended computers, etc.

But, possible, legal, and moral are three different things. Is it possible for you to hack a grade book and change your grades? Probably. Is it legal? No, and it’s very rare to be able to pull that off without getting caught. If you change only your grades, if anyone ever happens to notice, you’re caught immediately. If you change a bunch of grades, the discrepancy becomes obvious, and the changes will likely be reverted.

**Best Solution to Hire a Hacker to Change Your Grades**

Let’s say you’re in college, applying to an elite graduate school, so you change your grades to ensure your GPA is high enough, and you get in. That means you have automatically become qualified and actually earned admission. If you are not really left with much options, this might seem the smartest thing to do. What are you waiting for?

ultrarunning,excynimphica,Dealing with injury as an ultra runner,"I've been dealing with a knee injury for the last 5 weeks, likely a lateral tear in the patella tendon. Lots of pain increasing when I try to run. I tried PT and a special patella brace, but nothing stops the pain from returning. Next week I am getting the tendon needled to facilitate faster localized healing, after which I will not be able to do anything with the leg for a week. I'll have to build up strength walking after that.

Something I could never have imagined is the mental toll that injury can take. Over the last 2 years since I started running, I've created an identity for myself as ""the runner"" to all my friends and family. Training for a still upcoming 100k was the highlight of my year, and I know everyone was probably tired of hearing me talk about it. 

But now that I, a runner, cannot run, I feel like this identity I've created has crumbled to dust and I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate as well, I'm losing motivation to do other things, I'm starting to gain a little weight, drinking more...

The longest between aid stations is around a dozen km… I’m used to carrying 3L of water with me between bladder and flasks… I won’t need to carry that much for 12km.

Am I thinking about this right? I have to wrap my head around bringing less water and less food since I’ll have aid station support for the first time ever?  Or should I keep with my current system that I know works for me… (I would definitely say I drink much more water than average).

ultrarunning,flooredgenius,53miles after less than ideal training - last minute training tips?,"Looking for some advice, thanks in advance. I have a double marathon (53.6 miles) in two and a half weeks with 5,051ft of elevation and my training has been somewhat disrupted by life getting in the way. 

Six and a half weeks ago I ran a 6hrs15min PB 50k, and four and a half weeks ago I ran a 5hr55min PB 50k (I'm solidly mid pack) - both with similar elevation changes and on similar courses to the forthcoming double marathon. I recover fast and doing two 50ks in two weeks was fine. So I'm not being stupid in doing the double marathon. However, I usually average about 30miles a week, but that can vary from like 20miles to 45miles. Since the last 50k I've only averaged about 22miles a week, in total, with my longest run being 10miles. Which is obviously not ideal. Have got a few long hikes in in that time though.

What I am wondering is what it's worth me doing in the next two weeks? It's gone warm and sunny here (UK) and I suspect that it will be like that for the race, so I feel I should try and acclimatise a bit.

I've completed two road marathons in the past (2018/2019) in the 3:45 range. For the last 12 months I've averaged about 45 miles/week. The last several months it's been closer to 55 miles/week. I'm 49 and female.

I was training for a half marathon using Hanson's advanced. I didn't have a specific one in mind, just using the schedule. About two months ago I decided that I should train for a 50k trail race instead. I've been running the roads during the week and a long threshold run once a week. Weekends I've been hitting the trails and doing trail runs both days with a longer run on Saturday (3-7 hours) and a shorter run on Sunday (1-3 hours).  I am super slow on the trails, but have been training with some good elevation. Saturday was my longest day with 6,900 feet of elevation in 22 miles (super slow at about 19 minute miles average). I actually felt okay yesterday and did a short trail run for an hour and then went on an easy hike with the family. I feel fairly prepared at this point to do 7,400 feet in 31 miles. 

My question is about tapering! I really suck at tapering. I'm really wondering what I should do for the next two weekends to prepare. I can decrease the weekdays fine I think, but don't really know how much I should back off for the weekend trail running.

Thanks in advance!",1622470448
ultrarunning,martijnk79,Finished first 100 miles race!,"So last weekend I've finished my first 100-mile race and I've finished quite allright. I never thought about giving up once so my experience could maybe help other people. The race was Grand Trail des Lacs et Chateaux in the Belgium Ardennes, 165km and around 7000D+ which is pretty serious for this country since it's mostly flat ([https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/](https://grandtrail.be/en/courses/gt-160-2/)).

It took me around 31 hours to finish. I took longer then I wanted because my friend got injured at the 120k mark and they needed to evacuate him. He blew up his achilles and couldn't even walk. This was his own fault though, he trained like \~50K a month for the last 3 months so I was surprised he even made it to 120K. I wasn't going to quit because of him though and once he was safe I continued my journey alone in the middle of the night deep inside the creepy forrest where a lot of eyes were watching me :) 

I'm pretty sure this was the thoughest thing I've ever done. I mean I did Marathon des Sables in 2018 but that was relativley easy compared to this. This was so damn technical, some parts I could only go like 2-3 km/h plus staying awake for 31 hours while navigating along side dangerous cliffs and waterfalls is already a challenge on it's own.

Nutricion is def. the most important thing during a race like this. My body was just screaming for food the entire time. I had cliff bars as fuel and sometimes I took around 3 in 1 hour! Insane.... I'm so sick of them right now I can probably never eat them again.

The second most important thing is water and salt. I was drinking a lot and I also had sodium tablets which contained salt and magnesium that I took like every 20K. I was also eating salted foods at the checkpoints (mostly chips and chicken soup) and had around 15 bananas total. I am a salty sweater though, I knew this from MDS where I took a salt tablet every 30 min. My entire backpack was white of my sweat.

I did pee every once in a while and looked at the color. If it became dark yellow I took more salt and drank more water until it was light yellow again. I managed this really well and felt great the entire race. I also had a lot of coca cola at the checkpoints for my cafeine needs :)

Right now my body is totally exhausted but I do feel great. I still can't believe I've finished a 100-mile race, I never thought I could do this. It just seemed impossible but a decent amount of training, preperation and good management of nutricion and I have my 6 ITRA points :)",1622449092
ultrarunning,catsandcoffee16,Race Report: Bryce Canyon 50k (my first ultra!),"**Pre-race**
This may have been the hardest thing I have EVER done. Starting on Thursday, I increased my carb intake a lot, hydrated like mad, and rolled out my legs as much as possible.

The morning of the race started out well. I was up early, ate my normal oatmeal, protein powder, and banana, and hydrated with water + nuuns and coffee. I was at the start with plenty of time to get ready and man, I was nervous, but I was also really excited.

**Start to Proctor Canyon (miles 0-3)**
The run to the first aid station was fine. It was still cool and while sandy, not difficult. I drank a bit of water, ate about 100 calories, and was still in a great mood! I did not stop at this aid station. 

**Proctor Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 3-8)**
The next trek to the second aid station was technically tricky but again, not too hard. There was a LOT of uphill on ridges and a ton of people, so this was slow. I was still feeling great! The weather was low 60s, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and taking in liquid hydration (~400cal total). By this point I had probably consumer about 1.5L of water. At this aid station I refilled my pack with water and grabbed some watermelon and grapes and just kept going. 

**Hillsdale Canyon to Red Canyon (miles 8-14)**
This was great! I felt strong and was able to keep a good pace. There were rolling hills and some ridges but nothing too technical. Again, I was eating around 100 cal every 30 minutes between gels and liquid hydration (~400cal total). I also ate a banana since it was not hot yet and I figured I could keep it down. During this section I started using my salt tabs to prepare for the heat that was coming. I likely drank 1.5L during this section. At this aid station, I again filled up with water, got more tailwind, grabbed some applesauce and more watermelon, and kept moving. I was still in a GREAT mood, plodding along, happily running through the hoodoos. Little did I know the misery that was ahead. 

**Red Canyon back to Red Canyon (miles 14-19)**
This was the loop from hell! At this point the temperature spiked above 85F and the climb was completely exposed. It felt like it was a constant uphill along ridges, somewhat technical and VERY SLOOOOOOW. It was absolutely gorgeous, but this nearly broke me. After this I was seriously considering dropping. Making friends is what got me through this section. It was SO hard, but we were all in it together. It is amazing what having others to commiserate with can do for your state of mind. Once we were out of this loop and back on the flats, I had to walk more than I wanted. My body was just spent. Big reason, I didn’t consume enough calories. I just couldn’t deal with eating while trudging through this which was a major mistake. I likely only took in 200cal during this loop, but I think I drank 1.5L. I did take in a gel with electrolytes and caffeine. 

Back to the aid station, I grabbed a lot more water, more fuel from my drop bag, more tailwind, and went to the bathroom. I drabbed more watermelon, applesauce, and just kind of chilled for a couple minutes. This is where things started to hurt. It was HOT. I think we were going above 90 at this point and it was dragging me down. Before heading back onto the trail, I soaked my buff in cold water and poured it on my head and then wrapped the cold buff around my neck.

**Red Canyon to Hillsdale Canyon (miles 19-25)**
With the heat and the altitude, I was starting to not feel great. For the remainder of the race the temperature was above 90F with a max of 95F. Out of the aid station I just walked a lot. I took a salt pill and some water and started to feel a bit better. I was moving along though, running on the flats and downhills, and made another friend. At mile 26 though I fell and that cost me time. Other than a bruise on my left shoulder and scraping my left knee, I was fine but the swelling in the knee started to slow my pace. 

And then came another massive climb. This was unreal. We were grouping up again and EVERYONE was struggling. It was like this came out of nowhere, the heat was absolutely the contributing factor at this point. I also had my slowest mile EVER here. My left knee started to hurt, and I had to sit a couple times. I also ran into another runner who was seriously dehydrated so I stayed with her for a while, gave her a salt pill and some water, and made sure she was ok (she ended up DNFing at the aid station). The heat was seriously no joke. During this section I drank 1.5L of water, ate only 300 calories (again, major mistake but I could not take in more), and had a salt pill. 

At this aid station I refilled water (but not my hydration back, whoops!), but I don’t think I grabbed any fuel. Nothing looked good. I did think about dropping again but realized I was just being ridiculous and pushed on! 


**Hillsdale Canyon to Proctor Canyon (miles 25-30)**
We had one last climb and again, wtf. It was awful. Around mile 28, my right foot was bugging me. I was assuming I was getting a blister on the bottom and my toes were sore. This made it really hard to run so I shuffled along and basically gave up on finishing in less than 9 hours. This part was pretty uneventful. I ate another 300 calories, drank ALL the water I had on me (1L), and was so happy when the elevation was over. The run into this last aid station was magical. When I got there, it turned out there were out of water, so I grabbed some gnarly (do not recommend) and some pickles. 

**Proctor Canyon to Finish (miles 30-33.8)**
These final miles were all downhill, thank god. It was SO HOT! I ran a bit but again, shuffled along. My right foot was really bugging me but I was so excited to nearly be done. With less than 2 miles left, I started to cry. I was SO overwhelmed. I never thought I would be able to do something like this. When I saw the finish line and could hear the music, a rush of excitement came over me and I found the strength to run along the finish line. As they said my name, and announced this was my first 50k, I started to sob (all on video, lol). I was just so fucking overwhelmed by this experience. 

**THE END!**
I stopped at the medic to clean up my knees, ate a burger, Oreos, bananas, and chips, and drank a lot of water. Once I took off my shoes, I realized there was SAND in my shoe that had built up on the bottom of my right foot. This is what was causing the pain. There do not seem to be any blisters, but my toenails may not fare well. Right now they are ok, but my toes are sore. I am also pretty sure I have planter fasciitis in my right foot. But other than that, I FEEL AMAZING! I am not too sore, I can walk fairly well, and I am ready to do this again!!!!

Through this experience, I learned that I am capable of so much more than I would have ever imagined. Between the altitude (7000-8500ft), the heat (85-95F), and the elevation (5882 ft), this was hands down the hardest thing I have ever done but will absolutely carry me forward through future ultras. For a first ultra, I think I selected an incredibly challenging one. The race was overwhelming and emotional. I doubted my ability many times, several of the climbs made me consider dropping, the altitude kicked my butt, and the heat was intense. But I was determined to finish. Remembering my training, and the advice you have given me, I was able to work through the doubts and I found my rhythm. Because of my training, I learned how to handle the pain and challenges this trail threw at me. I knew that I was just being dramatic when I felt like quitting and that if I did, I would SO DISSAPOINTED WITH MYSELF.",1622417204

Pace: 8:35
Place: 3rd overall

Goals:
A. 8:30 avg pace (close enough on this one!)
B. Sub 5 hour finish (check!)
C. Finish (check!)

Overview:
The race went better than I could have hoped! I started off feeling incredible and kept my pace steady for the first 8-9 miles. I wasn’t going in expecting or planning to place, but when someone told me I was in third at mile 16...I had to hold it. I’m really thrilled about placing, especially since I’ve never run a race over 10 miles before and only really started running 7 months ago.

Pre-Race:
Friday night, my girlfriend, Ally, and I mapped out the aid-stations and put together food/hydration packets for hand-offs. The schedule we set up was as follows:

3 bags of roughly 200 calories of dried fruit to be handed to me at the 1/3 and 2/3 aid stations. (Same one since it was an out and back) I ate food every twenty minutes. 

Five Gu to be taken every hour. 

4 nuun tabs for the first 9 miles (though I opted instead to stick with nuun until mile 22. 

1 liter of tailwind for mile 9 onwards (switched to mile 22 as noted above)

I carried a 17oz handheld, which I topped off at every aid station.

On race day, I had a granola bar and a banana at 4:30am. I drank a redbull at 5:30.

I chose to wear a lightweight long sleeved shirt going out, as the temp was in the high 30s. At mile 9 I changed into an ultra light short sleeved shirt. This turned out to be the pro move. The weather wound up getting hotter than forecasted.

The race!

Miles 1-6 - Start to the Tunnel Aid Station

The first leg of the race went great. I was feeling a bit of soreness in my left calf, but that resolved itself after mile four.

Rather than rushing out, I tried to keep mid-pack to conserve energy. I settled into an 8:30 pace with a group of 4 other runners. We all ran together until mile 7.

Mile 4 was the road section with an unexpected 200 feet of climb. Going out this was easy...coming back not so much. 

Miles 6-9 - Tunnel to Hollywood AS

I split from the group at mile 7 and kept a comfortable pace ahead. This stretch was relatively uneventful. I made a point to eat as much of the first bag of dried fruit as I could. I made it through most of it.

Miles 9-15.5 - Hollywood to Tin Can AS

The handoff and shirt change at Hollywood went suuuuper smoothly. I was in and out in 30 seconds. Huge thanks to Ally for being super on top of crewing.

After Hollywood I let my pace get away from me a little. Logged a few 7:40-7:50 miles, which I knew would come back to bite me later. I started passing runners from the tail end of the 50 mile here.

I was still feeling great at the tail end of the this leg. Near Tin Can I passed the fourth place runner, but I wouldn’t find that out until mile 16.

Miles 15.5 - 22

At mile 16-17 (after the turn around) I ran into the group I started with, who let me know I was in 3rd place. Wasn’t expecting this, but for sure wasn’t going to let myself lose it.

Mile 19 was where I started paying for the faster miles early on. Nothing bad, but felt the fatigue and started to dial things back a little...likely not enough though. Knowing I was holding onto third...but not knowing by how much made me push harder.

I made it back to Hollywood feeling pretty good. Took about a minute breather while Ally swapped my food, loaded up the tailwind, and I shook the rocks out of my shoes.

Miles 22-25

This is where things started to fall apart a little. I dialed back to roughly a 9 minute pace coming out of Hollywood. I’d taken a pretty big swig of water and downed some cranberry juice. Stomach wasn’t handling speed well. This leveled out a little, and I was able to get some running around my goal pace, but I was fading fast.

Around here I started to get a sharp pain on the top of my left foot. Not sure what caused it, but from mile 22 to the end, every step was agony.

I was really feeling it when I hit Tunnel AS. Wasn’t terrible though.

Miles 25-31 (Tunnel AS to Finish!)

This sucked. Like really sucked. Remember that surprise elevation? That sucked. I felt okay up until the marathon (3:39!) but after that things started falling apart. The road stretch was awful and the uphills were aggravating my foot. This is when my quads decided that they were done too.

I would up hiking a few of the hills. The road stretch felt like it would never end. 

After the roads I was toast. Clocked mid to high 9s for the rest of the run. At mile 28, I met Ally along the trail and she paced me to the finish. This was a godsend cause I was pretty much ready to walk.

The last two miles were the hardest I’d run in my life. I was ready to just take a nap on the side of the trail. On the bright side though, my legs hurt so much that I barely noticed the pain in my foot.

I survived though. I held on to third place and ran it into the finish. I then walked about twenty feet before I gave up and laid down.

I’d say my first ultra went well.",1622327412
ultrarunning,myradlife,Ready or not.... Advice for a 50k that's 14 days away,"I've been training since Feb, slowly increasing weekly mileage from quite low 15-20mpw so that I've been in the 40-50mpw for the last five weeks. I have done many half marathon trail runs and one road marathon before.

I've been training 90% trail with significant elevation, so though I'm nervous for the 4,000' on race day, I think I'm prepared there.

ultrarunning,Freeasabird01,Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim adventure report,"Three years ago I was just a casual runner, running about 20 miles per week. I loved trail running though and would come to learn about the trails in the Grand Canyon and wanted to run across them. I didn’t even know it was a thing people did, but I wanted to run them in one day since I don’t back backpack. I had never even run a marathon and didn’t even know what an ultra marathon was at the time. I spent about 9 months of dedicated training to run R3 in a day, but in the end it wasn’t enough. I made lots of mistakes. I pushed too hard, redlined it the whole time, didn’t control my heart rate going uphill, and didn’t have dry clothes or a jacket for the cold north rim. I made it across in one piece, but was absolutely not prepared for the return, so I took a shuttle back with my tail between my legs. 

The next year 2019 I ran my first marathon followed by three ultra marathons. In 2020 I ran over 2000 miles. With all that extra training and experience being on my legs for extended periods, I felt I was ready for another attempt. So I booked a race schedule around getting a nice buildup to culminate with another R3 attempt.

February - 6 hour trail race
March - 24 hour flat looped race (which I hoped would be my first 100 mile distance, and would be my only effort to match the expected time on feet of R3)
April - very hilly 50k
May - R3

The build up races were a disaster. The 6 hour trail race was cut short because I didn’t have spikes and the trail froze as we were running in the snow, leading to only 17 miles completed. The March race I hit a distance PR of 68 miles within the first 14 hours, but gave myself tendonitis from having my shoes tied too tight, leading to two weeks of zero running. And the 50k I went into very undertrained because of the preceding injury. All that also made my knee start giving me fits. I almost cancelled the whole thing, but my doctor gave me the green light saying I likely wouldn’t cause any permanent damage (just extended recovery). 

Here was my plan: power hike down all of South Kaibab, power hike across the mid canyon with short running bursts just to test my knee on the flat areas, and control my ascent up North Kaibab without burning out like last time. If that all went well, I would give it hell on the way back. If not, I gave myself permission to bail again due to injury. 

Starting down SK my knee was feeling good. It kind of got to 2-3 on the pain scale it had been doing before and just held there, never getting worse. Power hiking is about all I can do anyway, last time it took me 1:45 to get to the river, this time 2:05 just hiking, so not much time even lost with less damage to my legs. 

Across the mid canyon I also did well. I stuck to the plan and only ran for a few short bursts where I had a flat or slight downhill grade. The knee continued to hold up well. I did my first fluid refill at Cottonwood which is about 14 miles in. 

Once you go past Manzanita the climb becomes relentless. You climb for lengths and grades (and altitude) that we simply don’t have in the Midwest, so literally my only experience was of the prior failure in this very spot of the canyon three years prior. I think it helped at least a little to have a HRM this time which I didn’t have before. This let me find a good pace for the hr I was targeting, or at least didn’t want to exceed. Surprisingly, I still bested my slowest mile by 5m/m (45 vs 40) and summited the north rim in fantastic shape, one hour slower than prior. 

After changing socks and lubing up I was ready for the return. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind this time, I was going to finish this thing!! I checked in with my trail buddy Jay I had picked up a few miles back. We had been leap frogging for a while, only he bonked hard over the last 2 miles. He was going to come back, but needed more rest time, so I left him to catch back up later. 

1.7 miles back down I trail returned to Supai tunnel which I didn’t spend long at going up. This time I stopped for a proper rest (my first and only), lunch, and to refill my 2L bladder a second time. During my break Jay came strolling in as expected. We headed out a few minutes later and stayed together all the way back to Manzanita. Normally I really enjoy blasting the downhills. I really wanted to give them hell here and pick up some time, but I’m definitely not used to such loose gravely steep descents that give you little traction, and my knee just didn’t like grades that exceeded ~ -5% grade or so, so I had to power hike the majority of this as well.

Back at Manzanita, Jay really needed another proper stop. He had a hot spot to attend to and also needed to eat. We agreed to separate once more, with me fully expecting that he’d catch me again some number of miles later as he’d been doing for the last 10-12 miles. 

This part of the trail is where things finally start to level off a little. The average grade is typically -2-3% coming back down, which my knee was just fine with. Still, with 28+ miles on my legs, a full 15L pack, and having climbed to 8200 feet just 2 hours ago, I could only manage 15-16 minute miles, with a best mile of 13:25. But I didn’t care. I was doing this thing, and I was doing it strong. And I was still ahead of my suspected paces should I have to walk the whole thing. 

I lucked out so much with the weather. Many people who are more confident with their experience running hills and mountains might do this between November and April. The upshot it you get more moderate temps. The downside is the north rim is closed, so there’s no bail out option. You’re coming back to the south rim the way you came whether you like it or not. Anyway, the weather. I was expecting highs in the upper 80s or low 90s. A couple days earlier it had been those temps and higher. But Saturday 5/22 only got to about 80 degrees as the high at Phantom Ranch. Cruising back down to these lowest altitudes felt warm relative to the rest of the day, but it was still quite comfortable. 

I hit phantom ranch right before the dinner bell was to ring. It was about 4:30 or so and campers and lodgers were gathering for their coveted steak dinner. I refilled my water/Gatorade powder once more, tried to lube inconspicuously, put more food from my pack into my accessible pockets, and quickly headed off to finish my last 9.5 miles. 

The river trail runs alongside the Colorado for 1.7 miles before taking you to Bright Angel trail, the most famed and popular trail in the park. I’d always heard people decry the river trail, and now I know why. Every time you start gaining elevation you quickly lose it. The whole thing is sand; I managed over 35 miles without getting crap in my shoes and 50 paces in my shoe is filling with sand. And then there’s the rocks. Most of the corridor trails are well groomed, but I guess because this one doesn’t get foot traffic from the mules it doesn’t get pounded flat like the rest, so there’s lots of rock sticking up from the trail (it reminded me of the Ozark trail in Missouri). 

Once I hit Bright Angel, it was as beautiful as I could ever expect from being in the desert. Everything was lush green from spring growth. The climb wasn’t too bad. Everything was clicking. I wish I had more to report in this area, but the one thing of note wasn’t what was there, it’s what wasn’t there - Jay. I kept looking over my shoulder expecting him to come up on as he had done many other times, but he never did. The trail was also so desolate, quiet and peaceful for a good six miles or so. I went a few miles without seeing a soul - a rarity for a corridor trail in May. I guess all the rim to rimmers had finished and overnight campers were already down below. At 3 mile rest house though is when I started to run into people desperately trying to get out of the canyon before dark. I passed probably 20 people in the last 2 miles, including one getting emergency help from a ranger.

Once I got to the tunnels I knew I was finally close. The climb up BA isn’t as steep as NK, but it’s longer and it was lonelier not having anyone going my speed. And just like that, I popped out at Bright Angel Trailhead. Moving time 15:45, total time 16:45. Consumed about 4,400 calories of almost all carbs, including 8 liters of Gatorade from powder.

I found out the next day via Facebook that Jay’s foot gave him more grief and he finished an hour behind me. 

Next steps, I need to let my knee rest and heal. It’s really not that bad, but I want it back to 100%, where it was 2 months ago. https://imgur.com/a/RTZx9cZ/",1622138680

ultrarunning,Big_air_az,Opinions on Long sleeve shirts for ultras in hot weather?,"My background before ultras was a lot of long distance hiking where the standard shirt is typically some sort of button down or light weight sun protecting long sleeve shirt. For example, the Columbia PFG series.  

This has typically been what I wear in ultras as well just because I don't like getting sunburnt and I'm comfortable in them and used to them..  I've got a 50k coming up near Phoenix az with pretty high heat forecasted, 94 degrees.  While this isn't all that crazy hot, I live in Flagstaff AZ which is much colder and I don't have much heat acclimation. 

My question for you all is what is your opinion on long sleeve shirts for running in hot weather?  Traditional knowledge seems to be wear as little as possible, but there's also some trends of long sleeve lightweight stuff catching on like those ultralight hoodie's.  Also lots of summer workers like construction workers typically wearing long sleeves for the sun protection.

I have been thinking about it for awhile, and can't seem to find a downside, other then stereotypes....

I recently took a pair of running shorts and converted them to skirt. It was a little long for running, but overall worked well. Only issue I had was the length. Once it got wet from sweat it got a little annoying, bit long shorts do the same. 

I did a 20 mile run with no other issues. I did wear compression shorts under, but still felt cooler and had less fabric bunching. 

I have since shortened it to the same length as my compression shorts (mid thigh), so we will see how they work on a short run.",1621886935

I've been running for about a year. Did a 50 miler in January in about 12 hours. I only want to finish the 100 in less than 30, but closer to 24 if I can.

Is 40 mpw for the next 3 months good enough?

If I run slower will that help my knees? Or maybe I should go faster? I'd I run slower with an increased cadence, I'm still increasing impact right? I imagine this is a scientific question, but what do you think? Should I try getting 50mpw just at a very slow pace like 8:00 min/km?

Curious what lube/tape.. etc you use for (1) blister prevention and (2) once you have blisters? 

Ive seen various recommendations in similar threads, but looking for a compilation here so I can do a bit more research. 

Sometimes even with the right socks and shoes, ya just get em! 

I will use chauff cream sometimes on longer runs in potential hot spots, but again this stuff is expensive. I prefer tape / pads on potential hots spots as prevention vs the chauff cream because my feet feel slippery in my shoes after.

Then blistex blister pads if/when they form. Another product I used to use is now discontinued.

ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,First steps- Mountain 40k in October- does my training plan look ok?,"Not an ultra, sorry if that is not allowed. Building up to ultras. Here in Spain 50k seems to be a less popular distance- the mountain running circuit seems mostly to have events in the 40ish, 60ish, 80ish then 100+ range.

**The race**: 42km approx. with 1800m+ vert, October 16, In El Escorial, NW of Madrid, Mostly on mountain trails, dirt roads.

**Me**: 45M, currently doing 50-60km/week usually, with long runs of up to 32k/20miles, almost all on trails/dirt roads. Mostly hilly runs with frequent mountain outings of 500m+ at weekends.

**Factors to consider**: The heat of summer- sometimes up to 40C (104F) where I live, and very hot weather can last weeks at a time. Not humid. 

**Vague Plan**: because of the heat, a bit of periodization. JUNE, take advantage of long, still relatively cool evenings to work on building speed with one day hill intervals, one day flat intervals. JULY, spend some  time focusing on heat adaptation in order to be able to maintain volume and fitness. Use the fact that running in heat and direct sun is hard to build resilience; AUGUST take some time off work and go hunting vert in the mountains. Do reccy of some of the race route. SEPTEMBER max training load- build to 8+ per week, do reccy of rest of race route, at least one 5hr+ run to test nutrition, hydration, gear, chafing strategies. OCTOBER taper down to the 16th

ultrarunning,HaskersMaskers,Is a 50mi Too Ambitious For My Running Background?,"First off, I'm a long time lurker in this community as I have wanted to dip my toe into ultras for the past year or so and keep coming up with excuses as to why I can't. Looking for some advice from much more experiences folks in this community.

# Background

24M. Former college football player and still a much larger than average runner (6'5"", 215lbs). Started running in 2018 to lose weight, ran my first/only marathon in 2019 (4:09), and was planning on running two more in 2020 but, ya know, \*gestures at everything\*

Cumulative miles in 2019, 2020, 2021 are 888, 1614, 780. Average mileage per week so far in 2021 is 40. I'm currently on week six of a slightly modified Pfitz 18/55, so have had mileage of 46, 42, 45, 49, 52, 50 the past six weeks. Taking a cut-back week this week down to \~35 but in general I feel really good. Long Runs are in the 16-18 range right now. I didn't have a race on the calendar when I started this block and was just going to see where it could take me. I set a goal of 3:30 for training paces and so far, it feels like that's about where my fitness is. Long Runs with MP miles within feel tough but I'm not destroying myself to hit the paces. 

# 50k/50mi

Leading to my main question, I'm itching to get back to racing and in specific, ultras. The 50k I am eyeing is on July 3rd about 10mi from my house. It's in a state park that I'm very familiar with but has a relatively hard profile (1423m). It was one that I was training for last spring so I know the climbs and how much is runnable but I haven't been putting in any trail specific work this year.  I'm also thinking about a 50mi (Stewart Tunnel) that is run in Southern WI on August 1st. It has an easier profile (744m) and a generous cutoff (12hrs). My initial plan was to modify the 18/55 plan to incorporate some long runs on the trails and back-to-backs. I would toss most of the MP specific work out the window and do a LT workout during the week with back-to-back LRs on the weekend. I've been practicing fueling but plan to use those LRs as a time to completely dial that in.

My question is: With only 9 weeks to the 50mi race, will I have enough training base to complete the race? Is 15 weeks, peaking around 60-65, enough for my first 50mi? Would it make sense to run the 50k as my last ""workout"" in 6 weeks and then taper?  Like I said, I feel like I'm overthinking and making excuses as to why I can't. I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm either biting off more than I can chew or to just do the damn thing and write a race report afterwards.",1621477812

I’m pretty sure it’s because I let my guard down at aid stations and wind up eating and drinking less than I think I am.  Usually, by the time I realized I’m in a caloric hole, it’s too late to turn things around and I wind up puking before toughing things out for the rest of the day.  It tends to be really subtle until it hits me like a brick and my stomach is turning over itself, making eating that much harder or impossible before I yack.  I have a plan to help keep on top of this moving forward (including being a lot more intentional with what I eat and the portion size on a more regular schedule), but I’m wondering if anyone has noticed any early warning signs that tell them they need to start eating again before disaster strikes.

Race report 24 Hour Run for a Cure:

Bit of a long read sorry.

Background info:

Age: 17

Gender: M

Furthest previous run: 32km in 3 hours

Course was 850m laps of the school fields

Goals: 

1. Finish 24 hours 

2. Complete 100 Km

3. Raise $2000 NZD for cancer support/research

Hours 1-6

Started out at 8.30am with a frost still on the ground. Feet were soaked pretty much straight away, which lead to some rubbing on the inside of my right foot. I band aided up, applied some glide and kept running, as soon as the ground was dry, I changed socks and re did my plasters. Rubbing stopped shortly after and I had no blisters to show but kept the plasters on to be safe. Moved well as was expected, stopping every few Km to grab some apple/orange slices and hydration. Went through the first Marathon in 4.30 and had finished 52 Km at hour 6. I was moving wayyy too fast but some stern words from my coach helped me to focus on the big picture and slow way down. This definitely affected me later, but also meant I had some decent Kms under my belt early.

Hours 7-12

Still jogging most laps with set walking intervals to start with, and everything kept going smoothly till about hour 8.5 when I started getting sharp pains in the top of my right foot. We tried a shoe change, sock change, relaxation techniques and different strapping techniques but not much was helping the pain and it was looking pretty bleak. The sun set and temps dropped right as it was getting really bad which lead to some really slow walked Kms. Luckily at Hour 10ish  we ordered pizzas which was a massive mood boost, and a bunch of students from the dorms came out to run a few laps with me. Shortly after this one of my teachers/ coach tried a new strapping technique which together with a slightly altered running style, reduced foot pain greatly. Stumbled through 82.6km at 12 hours.

Hours 13-18

6 of my running buddies and good friends from school showed up with some tunes and positivity, past half way so my mentality was improving and my foot was feeling better, back to mostly jogging laps with set walking intervals. When they left, they were replaced by teachers and dorm students that had snuck out of bed, cloud cover came in which lifted temperature and hence the mood. One teacher brought a brazier down which was massive. These hours weren’t very fast but time past quickly and the spirits were high. Food and water was going down well, no blisters to speak of, minimal chaffing and not too much pain. At 1am it started to rain lightly which scared us at first but it held off and only rained very lightly for the next few hours, not enough to cause chaffing or make us cold. 16 hours through I had finished 100km which was incredible feeling, and a massive mood boost. Ticked over 109.4km at the 18 hour mark.

Hours 19-24

Slow slow slow. Lots of walking through these laps. People had started leaving at hour 18 so there was only me and a couple of others for a little while, this was tough on my mind but luckily my swim coach and elite ultra-runner showed up with her dog and some excellent advice and chatter. At 3am people started coming for the morning and this kept me going, though still very slowly. A couple hours before dawn I hit another low point as my foot pain returned and I still had 4 hours to go. Lots of supported acted as if I was already done despite a lot of pain and Kms still to go. Could hardly stand for a while there and was emotionally wrecked at the thought of not finishing after doing so much. Kept moving slowly and held out for dawn, after which my pain started reducing. Walked pretty much all the last 6 hours, but minimized stops between laps. Managed to jog for the last lap before I finished with 132.1 Km. Poured with rain as soon as I finished but I didn’t care. Drove the 2 mins home and managed to stay awake long enough to shower and pass out.

Ending thoughts

Super happy with how it went overall. Feel a bit like better pace management at the start could have let me run further, but for a first ultra, let alone 24hrs I am super proud of how it went. Even better is the fact that I raised over $3000 for my charity, which is way more than my goal, and I smashed my 100km goal for the run.

I want to work towards doing the Bigfoot 40 in July 2022, that is 43.2 miles and 9,000 feet plus and minus elevation. 

I was looking at the course map and noticed that the first aid station is 12 miles in, the second 14, and the finish 16 from there.

So I’ve been running for almost two years now, and just finished my first 100k on April 10th of this year. I ran a 50 miler last October, and have also run two marathons and two 50k races since I started running (late summer 2019).

Squaw Peak 50 miler, June 12
Pike Peak 50 miler, July 31

I’ve had no problem successfully following training plans like the ones found in Relentless Forward Progress, and have found joy in completing every challenge I’ve so far tackled.

1. This race is at elevation and I live at sea level
2. The race is 80% male (I'm female) so im assuming this will significantly shift the results faster? I considered basing my plan on just womens results but in an average year only about 10 women finish the race so its a small sample

This past weekend, I was scrambling to meet the cutoff times at the aide stations. Since I started, I've had the mentality, ""walk the uphill sections; run the flats and downhills."" And that was barely enough to meet the cutoff times and fuel myself properly on Saturday. I followed a training plan pretty rigidly since January, and I still feel so mediocre.

Dirty German 50K Trail Race in Pennypack Park, Philadelphia
Date: 
May 8th, 2021

Conditions: 
Very Cool, Trails were wet and an absolute mudfest. Several stream crossings, mostly singletrack, several miles of crushed stone/paved bike path along the way. 

Preparation: 
I felt really good heading into my first ultramarathon. My training had hit most of the benchmarks I was hoping for. I kept my mileage fairly low- peaking at little over 50 miles a week (almost all trails) and only running 5 days a week to prevent injury. I put in at least 5 long runs of 20+ miles including  a trail marathon 5 weeks prior. Had a good nutrition plan, good taper, good rest. Felt confident. 

Race Day: 
The conditions were much wetter than I expected. Philadelphia had gotten hit with a lot more rain than Delaware the last few days. There would be no dry shoes at any point in the race and the depth of mud/slippage deeply impacted footing, pacing and effort. 

I was fine with letting the leaders get away early on, and settled into a comfortable pace for the first few miles. But after the 2nd mile directly behind two guys, I realized that I was following them too closely, and I wasn't running my own pace. So I sidestepped them and picked things up. Shortly after, a guy passed me (I called him Beardo) and at 4 miles I was tempted to go with him... but this time realized that it was too early and again I needed to run my race, so I let him go. My body felt really great. I was light on my feet and easily able to hop over the deepest mud puddles and jump over logs across the trail (note: this may have been a contributing factor to what happened later).  Felt like it made sense to not have my feet more saturated than absolutely necessary. 

I hit my nutrition goals for the first 10 miles and I was right on my goal pace. As early as 13 miles in, people were already coming back to me and I wasn't pushing. I moved from 8th overall to 7th, and then 6th as we hit the halfway point and started on the second loop. Around mile 14, though, I noticed something strange. A couple of times that I stepped up over a log, I felt my right hamstring begin to tighten, nearly seizing up. I wondered if I had gotten dehydrated already or was low on sodium. I tried to stomach some bacon and potato chips at my next Aid station but I hardly got any in. I walked through the aid station and stretched out my leg lightly. I had no idea what was in store.

Still feeling pretty good, around 16 miles I caught back up to Beardo and moved into 5th place. Again, I was feeling fine in every way but my hamstring, fully knowing that there was a lot more racing to do.  The miles passed and I held my steady pace, but I was so aware of every time I had to bend my legs extra- going up hills, hopping on a rock or log, and had to be extra careful. 
A few miles later my first big seize up happened. It was around the 21 mile mark. I attempted to jump over a low log, only 8 inches off the ground, and my hamstring locked. I stumbled to the side and yelled, trying to pry my leg back straight and get rid of the cramp. It felt like a baseball formed on the back of my leg under the skin. I've dealt with a little cramping here and there, but nothing like this. At the Aid station at mile 23, my family met me. I needed a short break, so I decided to change out my muddy socks and massage my hamstring a little, hoping that this thing would go away. I stopped for a little less than 2 minutes and took off again. My confidence was fading, but it was clear that I couldn't catch the runners in front of me who were way out there, so my real task was just to hold my position. And I had a big gap over 6th place.  I had held an 8:24 pace through the first 22 miles through thick mud, which was right on track for me. But that was when the cramping really hit. 

The last 8 miles were a serious sufferfest.  Both hamstrings began to seize regularly. 6 times in the last 8 miles one of my hamstrings locked up completely, sending my shrieking and crashing onto the ground on the side of the trail, rolling on my side and trying to get my leg to straighten back. But when I straightened it out, my quad would lock up. So each time I tried rolling around into a position where the seizing would stop, then carefully find a way to stand back on my feet without letting it lock again, then walk it out, and then gently try to jog again without lifting my leg too high, or it would start all over. So I'd run for a few minutes at a shuffle, then scream, fall over again, then crawl, walk, and get running again. 
This is where the ultra community showed how awesome it is. An older woman doing the 50 miler stopped and gave me salt tabs. Another woman offered me a gel. A guy helped me get up and then did a 20 second fist pound massage on my hamstring. Another guy shot water into my mouth from his hydration pack, since I had dropped mine off earlier (since stations were only 3-4 miles apart). I would get a few minutes of respite, then everything would lock again. But people were SO encouraging. This is where it was a real gift to have the 25k runners and the 50milers on the course at the same time, because otherwise I would have been out there mostly alone. It was also very humbling to appear so pitiful to everyone who ran past. 
At this point, all these guys that I had developed a mile lead on began catching up, as my pace of jogging, falling, stretching, and walking worked out to 11-12 minute miles.  I realized my top 5 hope was out of reach, so the goal became to finish my first ultra. There were times in the last two miles that I was yelling at my leg on every step- ""DON'T DO IT! DON'T YOU LOCK UP AGAIN!"" I'm sure I was a real joy to be around at that point. 

It was a fascinating experience, because every time the legs relaxed, I would run past a bunch of people, then they'd pass me again when I lay in the ditch down the trail. They'd say things like, ""man I'm so sorry, hang in there."" And then I would awkwardly pass them again 5 minutes later, only to repeat all over again. 
But when I heard the sound of the accordion player at the finish line, I knew I would finish. My second half of the race was over 25+ minutes slower, which is not normal at all for an even paced runner like I tend to be. But I crossed the line, and the first half of my race proved enough to allow me still hobble into a 10th place overall finish and second in my age group- which means I get a coveted German Weather House award!
I'm still not sure the root of my cramping. Weak hamstrings? Low sodium? Seems strange for salt to be an issue for a cool day of low sweat, where I felt like I was taking in a lot of electrolytes. Simply fatigue? I wonder if jumping over all those logs and leaping around mud puddles early on put a strain on my hamstrings that I didn't realize until later.  Or maybe the mud and slick footing made my muscles work much harder than my other marathon distance runs? I really want to figure that out. I've never cramped in a race before, marathon or otherwise. 
Despite the amount of pain, it was a great first experience and left me ready for more. I didn't hit my stretch goals of top 5 and sub 4:30 on this course, but I hit my base goals of finishing, making top 10, and placing in my age group. The ultra community is supportive, fun, and compassionate, and the race was wonderfully organized, despite all the unavoidable mud.  My family was incredible in their crewing  and encouragement. Can't wait to get back at it in the future.  For now, it's time to recover.",1620587711
ultrarunning,infp_futurepsych,“Pumped” calves that won’t go away?,"I transitioned from Brooks Cascadias to Altras in November and have been running an average of 25-30mi/week with no issues. I’ve been happy in the altras and love the space and cushion. However, about a month ago, my calves began getting super tight particularly on uphills (I do a good bit of climbing/mountain running) and they’ve only continued to get worse. The tightness definitely correlated with increasing vert, and some speed increase now that trails are melted out, and I’ve been mountain biking a little. So... definitely an up in training load which makes sense, but I’ve been running in the Altras for months without issue so I don’t think it’s poor transitioning (as it is for many). Perhaps I upped my training too much too quick, but it didn’t feel that way to me... Foam rolling and some PT has helped but I’m worried because summer is here and I have some ultras coming up and want to be able to keep increasing mileage and vert but am really limited now. My calves tighten up so much and feel pumped like your forearms when you climb a lot, if there are any climbers out here who know the feeling. It’s awful, and if I don’t stay on too of rest and rolling and PT, it ends up pulling through my Achilles and heel, which is super concerning. 

My PT said she didn’t think the shoes were a problem and instead we’re working on ankle flexion and strength to make sure I’m not just relying on my calves more than I should. But my friend who was in Altras for a bit said she had the same issue and once she swapped to Hoka Speedgoats it went away. I tried them on and liked the feel, and I like that they’re still a relatively low drop. I guess I’m caught up in the zero drop hype but I do like my Altras, and I think they’ve helped my form, but if I can’t run at all then they definitely aren’t worth it. Ha! 

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this in the Altras and if so what you did about it. I am super happy to change shoes again (to the Hokas probably) but also don’t wanna go chasing false solutions if my issue really is just form or something PT can fix.",1620586162

### Beforehand
A month-ish earlier, some previously stable part of my brain decided to go on hiatus and I spontaneously signed up for my first 50K running race, this one conveniently local to my hometown of Syracuse. That first taste of ultramarathoning went swimmingly in most regards; I covered three hilly park loops in just under four hours, with the only caveat coming from a navigation fuckup that left me without an official finish. Ah well.

So, back to the race registration search, looking anywhere within drive-and-one-night-in-a-hotel distance for another 50K in May or June. All of the big and “good” events were long since full; a couple little oddballs around the area had space, and I settle on the Greater Long Island Running Club’s (GLIRC) Greenbelt race. The elevation total (~3500 feet) looks the same as what I did in April; it’s Long Island, that can’t be that hard, right? Lots of previous years’ winners came through in 4:20s, 4:30s -- holy shit, can I win this thing?

I’ve got plenty of training distance in my legs, hitting 1100 miles for 2021 just before heading over to Long Island. What I don’t have, though, is a particular focus on elevation or trail running. I’ve been running from my home and around the roads on various loops -- in a flat neighborhood that’s part of a fairly flat city. In the week-ish between registering and racing, I push myself out a bit to get some more short stretches of singletrack, and even add in a day of hill repeats (three of them!). It’s obviously far too late to have any physical benefit, but I tell myself I’ll at least be a little more mentally comfortable on race day.

### Getting There
I ask the group chat of teachers in my preschool classroom if anyone else has already put in a time off request for the Friday before the race. Uh, yes, someone does; there goes my morning departure. We do have our awesome occupational therapist coming in to lead an afternoon activity, though, so I at least get to duck out at noon to start my six-ish hour schlep. That, of course, puts me on the inbound George Washington Bridge right at 5:00… and 5:10… and 5:20…

I make it to the start point in Plainview, switch from teacher pants into running shorts in a portapotty, and head off on the course with a mix of light jogging the driving malaise out of my legs and also walking/googling nearby pizza places. The ~1.5 miles of trail that I see are smooth dirt, rolling a bit, narrow -- still not my comfort zone of “sidewalk” but definitely doable! Back to the car, pizza acquired, into the hotel with a broken TV and choppy wifi to flop around for a few hours and prep my race day gear.

### Morning Of
I’m awake right before my 5:30 alarm for the 7:30 start. On the Monday prior, I’d tried to shift my schedule into morning running to be better prepared for Saturday’s race; that failed instantly with a flurry of snooze buttons. So, yeah, time for the earliest run start I’ve had in the last ~1.5 years. It’s an average cloudy morning, perfect for split shorts and short sleeves with some arm warmers I plan to ditch halfway through the race. I check out the various other entrants, recognizing one dude as Jesse, the 2018 winner from race photos, and wonder who else might be up with me trying to finish closer to four hours than to five (or six or seven or eight).

### Leg 1
The out-and-back itself is slightly under 7.5 miles, so our day begins with a bonus paved stretch to hit the full 50K. Sure enough, Jesse is off the front at the start; I’m behind him by 40ish feet and checking my watch as we hit mile one in sub-7. Oops. I’m annoyed by the overexcited start, but I’ve done hundreds of road miles at that pace and am not particularly worried about feeling ill effects from it later on.

We lose the pavement and hit the trails just after mile two, covering the same stuff I’d briefly checked out the night before. Right at mile three is one of the course’s several uncontrolled road crossings; I catch up to Jesse who’s stopped and waiting for a gap in traffic, and Ihor, who’d been a minute or so behind me on pavement, joins us as well.

We eventually make it through that stupid intersection (for the first of four times on the day) and move through the easiest unpaved part of the course with fresh legs in 7:30 and 8:00 miles. One of our trio peels just off-course for a pee break; I wind up leading by a short distance but never out of eyesight, thankfully, because turns out I desperately needed a veteran/local Long Island runner to keep my tourist ass somewhere close to following the course.

And then there’s Cold Springs Harbor. The handful of random race recaps I’d read mention the northernmost ~2 miles of the course as the toughest section by far; nothing ungainly in terms of grade or elevation, but plenty of roots and rocks and primitive stairs. My last-minute smooth singletrack practice… not as relevant here. I shuffle and walk a bit, Ihor blazes past me on one (literally, for him) screaming descent that I take much more cautiously, but I regain my position from him going up a hill and am again in first place at the turn-around aid station.

### Leg 2
Just like in my April 50K, I’m running essentially gear-less. I’d dug up ym old water bottle handheld and even tried it out a bit in the week prior before realized I’d rather take a ten second walk through the course’s plentiful aid stations as needed rather than carry that dumb thing for four plus hours. Anyway, I take a bit longer than usual at the turn-around for multiple cups of Gatorade, then take back off up the hill right as Ihor is getting in.

I’m slow and safe through the roots and rocks again, getting to the third-of-the-way point in around 1:25 -- technically right on pace for a 4:15 finish, though there won’t be any more sub-7 paved miles to help with the cause so in reality I know I'll be closer to 4:30. My focus starts to shift from time to position; how far ahead of Ihor did I leave the turnaround? Jesse is coming the other way not long after my departure. Sure as shit it’s looking like a three-person race.

I make it out of Cold Springs and settle back into 8:00-ish running through the more reasonable trail sections. I’m feeling good about making it through one of my two passes of the roots and rocks bullshit… when I trip over an Invisible Protruding Nothing and fall onto my knee and palm. Ah, shit. I pull myself back up, see a bit of blood starting to form on my knee but overall looks about as harmless as possible. On we go.

25K racers started an hour after the 50K, and they’re starting to show up on the course now, and of course I’m also going past the other folks in the 50. I’m pretty stoked to have them there for two reasons -- first as a couple of dozen people to cheer at me and tell me that I’m in first, and second as extra things to look for to make sure that I’m on the course now that I’m (at least for now) out of sight of Ihor and his superior navigation skills.

I make it to the southern turnaround at mile 16, grabbing my stash of Clif Bloks and a dry hat from my drop bag, leaving behind my soaked-with-sweat arm warmers. I try to gauge just how far I go back north before seeing the other runners; it’s about a third of a mile for Ihor and close to a full mile for Jesse.

### Leg 3
… in which I continue to think a lot more about just what I need to do to win the race and less about pace or time.

For now, I’m still moving decently through the rolling forested miles after the turnaround, more 8:00-ish miles as I reapproach the (ugh) start of Cold Springs Harbor. I tell myself that pushing myself to save two or three or five minutes through this stretch isn’t going to help me win, but overdoing it and breaking some number of bones in some part of my body after a slip can absolutely make me lose. So, the 9-10-10 mile splits I got on the hills of my first pass through this section become 11-12-10. So it goes.

At the turnaround I chug a third and fourth cup of Gatorade and force some a horrendous Gu packet down my gullet. I grab another Gu before heading out, though honestly if I needed some desperate electrolytes in the last hour I might’ve licked the sweat off my arms before opening up that thing. And back south we go.

### Leg 4
Ihor shows up coming the other way, maybe half a mile up the trail, but it’s a damn tough half mile and I figure he’ll also need a minute or three at the aid station. Twelve, fifteen minutes ahead? I’ll take that. Beyond the Cold Springs terrain, I start to apply that to how I’m running the “easy” trails for the last 10K to the finish. 8ish pace on flats becomes 9ish. Short and steeper rollers become tiny walking breaks. I tell myself I’m not going to lose my fairly safe lead with a one-hour final 10K, but I absolutely will lose it if I bonk or break something. (Somehow that conservative approach still doesn’t convince me to eat the stupid final Gu packet, though).

And… it all works the way I hoped it would. I keep plodding through mile 28, 29, 30, getting back onto some glorious pavement for the half mile to the finish. And then they even have an actual, honest-to-god finish line ribbon waiting for me. Well, more like a finish line vinyl banner. 4:34:12. Book it. I’ll take that voucher good for a pair of Salomon shoes and a gaudy plaque, please.

### Aftermath
I gather a bunch of congratulations and fist-bumps and attaboys from GLIRC people and 25K finishers and graze through their well-stocked snack options -- a 10 foot party sub here, some chips and cookies there, a bunch of water, two cans of Sprite, pizzas show up a bit later… good, good shit. Ihor, sure and steady enough, arrives second, somewhere in the 4:50s.

I still might try to squeeze in another East Coast 50K before my wife and I move out of the area this summer. I turned in my first place shoe certificate for a pair of Salomon trail shoes -- maybe it’s time to explore whether basically every single other runner in this GLIRC event had the right idea about footwear and I’m being the weirdo for wearing lightweight road shoes on trail ultras. On the other hand, I did win the damn thing, so…

But that’s future stuff. After a few more rounds of the snack tables, I reluctantly and gingerly re-loaded my car and headed back to Syracuse. Traffic was mercifully light going west through the city on a Saturday afternoon -- I think I’d used up all my foot and ankle muscles on those goddam roots and rocks and was not really on board for another half hour of working the clutch pedal through stop-and-go bridge traffic.

ultrarunning,AHRocks187,How do you deal with failure/disappointment?,"Hey everyone,

This morning I was meant to be trying to set an unsupported FKT on a 38 mile trail near my family home. But anyone in the South of the UK this morning will have experienced the strong wind and rain, and when I got towards the start point I realised that it was very foggy as well. Unfortunately I'd not been able to recce the first half of the course due to covid, and so the combination of weathers meant it felt silly to put myself in a potentially dangerous situation in an unknown area unsupported. After all, I have my first 100 in 5 weeks time so don't need to be getting injured!

Despite knowing it was probably the right choice, mentally I'm feeling crushed. Part of me feels it was weak to drop out, as if it was a race then I would have gone and started - but also if it was a race I'd have had support, route markings and other runners to buddy with. Doesn't help that I'm reading a book currently on fell running where that sort of weather must be standard!

ultrarunning,SmartestAnt,Power Hiking Form and Intensity,"Prepping for a mountain race in a few months, I have noticed a few things. On the incline trainer/treadmill, I am able to maintain zone 2 intensity at a steady walking pace up to about 15-20% incline. I take relatively normal steps/strides and feel no desire to put my hands on top of my thighs. 

Outdoors on real trails, on climbs of any significant grade, I am inclined to take much larger steps (power hiking), which immediately spikes my HR into zone 3/4 and requires me to put my hands on my thighs. The intensity is not sustainable for an all-day effort. If I take smaller steps, my HR falls slightly but I feel very inefficient.

What is the move here? Is this just revealing my poor aerobic base? Should I accept that the intensity will drift into zone 3 on climbs? My race starts with 2600 vertical feet in the first 3 miles (climbing to ridgeline). Going full blast for the first hour seems like the wrong answer.",1620402604

ultrarunning,bluedolphin87,Why are there no self supported ultramarathon races?,"I spent a few days at Cocodona last weekend and while the race was absolutely incredible, I found the cost of entry quite deterring. It got me thinking about some of the ultra-distance races in cycling, like the Tour Divide, or GB Duro, where there is technically a race happening, but really it's just people racing from one location to the other with no support. We have FKT's in ultrarunning, but I've never heard of a large group of people racing the PCT, for example, or some other long trail in self supported fashion. Am I the only one that thinks such an endeavour would be awesome? 

Furthermore, I wonder what the legal implications are? As long as there are no crews and aid stations, can you even legally organise an event that involves people going through wilderness areas? Even if it's just like 15 people who were invited via Facebook? You can backpack with a group of friends, so at what point is it not allowed? 

Either way, I think this should be a thing in ultra running. Just a group of people trying to finish a 200+ mile trail as fast as possible in self supported style, no crew and no aid stations.

ultrarunning,Realmless,Sustained Uphill Running,"I’m wondering if anyone has tips on how to train for sustained gradual uphills. The area I’m looking for guidance is the long, drawn-out, pseudo-hills where it’s not quite steep enough to require walking, but it’s got too much of an incline to run without expending precious energy. 

I’ve got a 100-mile race in August that has what seems to be two forever climbs that I think I’m drastically underestimating. I’m good with huge elevation gains, but I seem to struggle with prolonged gradual climbs. The first climb is almost 25 miles long and is only \~4200 feet of elevation. But each mile gradually climbs between 100-250 feet/mile for a net uphill effect that is relentless. The second climb is about 30 miles of the same, 100-250 feet/mile elevation change. These occasionally have breaks but for the most part they are dauntingly consistent. I’m wondering if there is a technique to improve upon this skill? My normal plan is to speed-hike the uphills and run the flats and downhills, but that would mean too much walking. I just completed a 50 miler with a six-mile stretch like this towards the end of the race and it basically was soul-sucking. I was able to do it, but it wasn't pretty. I am planning to get out on the course to see what it's really like, but I’m looking for ways to improve my incline running.

I just ran a half marathon with a pace of about 12:30/mile at a moderate-hard effort for me — I've been utilizing a run/walk for training and continued it for the race. I've been training on roads this season, but previous trail runs I've done have easily put me in the 15-20+ minute/mile range even with relatively mellow elevation gain. 

I have three months to train on trails, practice power hiking, downhills, and time on feet—but I'm freaking out that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of making the cutoff for the 50k I signed up for, the Wy'East Howl, which has 6,000 feet of gain and 5,000 feet of descent with two cutoffs - 6.5 hours to reach the 20.7 mile marker, 10 hours for the total race.

(Re: athletic background—I backpacked 1,000 miles in a summer a few years ago, but mileage was usually ~15-20 and I had the security of taking as long as I wanted. Current easy running pace is like 13:30/mile on roads.)

I've always been slow at every sport, so while I'm confident I could build myself up to a 50k distance, I'm significantly less confident that I could do it within 10 hours.

- His homepage: http://worldrun.org/m_introduction.php

 


I don't know much else about him. His Youtube-channel has only been active for about a month, but I watched his videos (IN DANISH!) on training, and he talks about:

- Long term planning: How to ramp up volume over the years from being a casual runner (less than 50K per week) to being an enthusiastic casual runner/casual ultrarunner (100 K per week), maybe even to international level athlete (140K per week in the off season).  
- Shorter term planning: Ramping up/down volume during the year, when to peak and rest and the importance of recovering for 3 months a year at (for example) half volume  
- Long distance training runs
- Tempo runs for ultrarunners: From classical tempo runs (1 min on/off) over medium/long intervals (1-5K) to very long tempo runs (20 to 65K)
- Injury prevention and early signs of fatigue, including persisting mood changes to more concrete physical signs of fatigue to chronic injury, with the main point being: Injuries do not usually appear because of a single run/session. They appear because you ignored signs or didn't realise early enough.
- Mental strength and fueling during runs (while the concepts are universally applicaple, I'm not personally convinced the specific content in these videos is as high quality as the training videos).

The training videos are probably only useful for other scandinavians (unless someone chooses to create subtitles for them), but his videos about the world runs are in english, and to me it seems like he want's to tell his stories, so more videos are probably coming.",1620040387

ultrarunning,HoboHuntahQ,I ran a Half Marathon while on Acid yesterday,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I consider myself an ultra runner I train for Ultras and I love long-distance running and I just really wanted to share this with people who love running as much as I do. 

I posted this in the running subreddit but they deleted it, unfortunately. I'm just going to copy and paste it here if that's okay?

Yesterday, 4/29/21, I ran 13.4 miles while on acid. I want to write about it because honestly, I've never experienced anything like I did yesterday and it was such an amazing experience. I've done acid a lot over the past few years, but almost every time I did it it was in a party environment or on my own in a bedroom. I love running, like a lot. Like when I think of myself as a person the first thing that pops up in my head to describe myself to others is that I'm a runner. Not a very good runner, but a runner who loves to run.

I really had no goals in mind with this run other than to be as careful as I could and to just enjoy myself. To enjoy my feet below me carrying me wherever I will them too. I didn't have a time limit I barely took any precautions. I had never done anything like this before. It was all very spur of the moment and I hardly did any planning or preparing whatsoever.

I got up for work at 3:15 am and got home from work around 6:40 pm. I knew that I was going to be tired and that I'd need to take the acid as soon as I got home so that I could still be running when the acid finally hit me. I started my run just after 7 pm Thursday afternoon.

Miles 1-3 They felt very similar to the beginning of every run. I wasn't tripping yet so I mostly focused on stretching my legs out and keeping a slow and easy pace. I followed the train tracks out of my small rural town that I live in and just kept running beside them for miles. Until the closest road was over 3 miles away and I was just in farmland.

Mile 4 About an hour or so after I took the acid. I could feel it coming on now and just felt incredibly light, happy, and proud. I was proud that I was running. I was proud that I worked an entire day and still decided to run a half marathon. I was proud of this crazy little trip I decided to take.

Mile 5-6 This is my favorite part of my run. I was surrounded by nature. River, swamp, farmland, open sky. For a brief moment, it all felt like mine. It felt right. I didn't want to leave but the sun was going down and I needed to make it home because I left my headlamp at home because I was in such a rush to start my run. Before I reached my halfway point I saw a white tail deer running like 25-30 yards to my north and ran with her for a while. I tried to get a picture of her or a video but I couldn't because I am stupid lol. Snapchat video of my favorite part

Mile 7-8 I was tripping. I ran along the train tracks and was mesmerized by the long golden grains of grass following the breeze in the wind. They all looked the same to me. Every piece standing tall and proud reaching towards the sky and the breeze from the south and east blowing them in the same direction of my home. I followed the dancing grass. I watched the birds take off on flight in front of me. I watched them jet off into the sky and effortlessly carry themselves on the wind. I felt very similar to them. Their wings are to them and the sky as my legs are to me and the ground.

Miles 9-11 The train tracks brought me up alongside small bodies of water and it was really, really hard to focus on my running because each wave and ripple on the water just grabbed my attention. Demanded that I look at it and appreciate the beauty I found myself alone and surrounded by. During this portion of the run, I would fall 4 times. 2 hard falls and a cracked phone screen made me realize I was flying. I wasn't jogging or slowly running I was straight up sprinting and I didn't even realize it. Running fast while sober is great and fun. Running fast while on acid is on another level completely. The sun was going down and I was bleeding, cold, excited, and happy.

Miles 12-13 I was coming back into town. Following the sunset. The incredible colors painted in the sky and the clouds make me wish I could paint because I feel the only way I'd be able to describe this sunset is on canvas. The blues slowly turning into various shades of purples, pinks, oranges, reds, and yellows was a perfect view to follow back into town. The smells and sights once I was back in town were very different from the rest of my run understandably. I ran along the train tracks towards the old co-op. Before I got there I had to run behind a gasoline station and I could smell the fried chicken and cheese curds they had for sale the smells filled me up and encouraged me to run home so that I could make french fries. By the dumpsters behind the gasoline station were piles of sand and cigarette butts from where the ashtrays were dumped. I felt sad and also proud. I felt sad because I used to be a part of that group. I used to smoke from 15-23 I have just quit smoking a little over 3 months ago. Running past those piles of cigarette butts helped remind me that me quitting smoking wasn't just going to have a positive impact on my life but all of the lives around me. I'm proud that I quit smoking and I will say that it is hard and it sucks at times, but that it's worth it just like running is to all of us.

Miles .4 Running. I did not want to stop but the sun was going down and even though for me it is normal to run and to sometimes do acid I'd never mixed both before. I didn't want the fun to stop but I knew that my neighbors wouldn't appreciate a crazy young man running around the streets after dark while he was tripping balls on acid. So I did the only other thing I could do. I went home and hopped in the shower to wash the blood, sweat, dirt, and rust off of my exhausted body. Guys before I hopped in the shower I stood naked in front of my mirror and was so happy. I looked at my body, my face, my legs. I felt so proud of myself. Of the power in my legs. The goofy smile I had melted onto my face. I have never in my life felt as happy as I did standing in front of my mirror naked, coming down from this incredible runner's high, and watching the walls and ceiling breathe with me.

I watched documentaries after my shower and before falling asleep. I think what I learned the most from yesterday is that I take too much for granted and that I don't appreciate what I have. I am very lucky and I believe so are most of you.

I think that if I never do acid again I'd be okay with it because yesterday, honestly was life-changing and I need more time to analyze myself and to keep doing what drives me.

I have a decent list of reasons for needing a vest, my longest runs so far have been roughly 10 miles, but keeping snacks enough is difficult in my little shorts and I figured with it getting warmer having water with me will be nice. 

I went for a run today, and holy shit, I struggled. My normal slow pace is 10:00 - 10:30 per mile, and my HR (according to my Garmin) normally is within 140-150 at that pace. I was pushing 180 the whole time at my normal pace, even slowing down to 11-11:30. Did you have to spend a while adjusting to running with a vest on?

ultrarunning,cpb09e,Knee pain but not during running...help,"29M. Run 30-35 miles a week. 

I have been experiencing a lot of knee pain recently on my right knee and have no idea what it could be and wonder if I should be concerned or if it is just overuse. The pain occurs right below my kneecap almost around the patellar ligament and to the tibia/top of the shinbone. I should mention I feel 0 pain while running. However, I have started playing basketball again and the pain happens mainly when I play basketball. If I do a stepback, jump or a hard cut where I plant hard on that knee/leg, it will feel like it just gives out with quite a bit of sharp pain. The pain goes away quickly, but it will give out and cause pain at random times while I play. Occasionally, it will hurt if I try and get up from sitting or laying down and put all the pressure on that knee/leg. If I press hard on it, the top of the tibia/shin bone will become irritated. 

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted that I have been running every day for the past 35 days and will play basketball 1-2 hours every other day. Not sure if it is just overuse or something to be more concerned about.

Came about 3 years ago after buying a pair of running shoes I knew after the first mile were too narrow and hurt my foot. Thinking I was “breaking them in”, I stubbornly continued to run and developed sesamoiditis. It has gradually got worse over time. I ran my last race two years ago and it was a trail half marathon. Today I can go about an hour to hour and a half running until the pain sets in and can do little climbing or sprints. It is a demoralizing injury. I run every other day still and in zero drop shoes it is tolerable. It has almost pushed me exclusively to road running. It’s been terrible. Needless to say, I am okay with my decision to pursue surgery. I truthfully avoided it at all costs.

ultrarunning,spack6789,Today I ran my first ultra since my DNF last summer!,"Hey everyone!

Last August I DNFed about 60 miles in during my first attempt at running a 100 miler. It was over the same weekend as the North Downs Way 100 - some of you might remember how hot it was! The heat really messed with my nutrition plan and I stopped at the advice of my crew after I was showing signs of heat exhaustion (definitely the right call!). I've certainly learned a lot from the whole experience, particularly regarding nutrition; I didn't have a backup plan, so once I started feeling nauseous enough that I couldn't keep down solid food I began to lose the battle against the bonk. 

I took the whole thing pretty badly in the aftermath, because had I tried it on a cooler day things might have gone a little differently (especially annoying because I felt like my legs had so much left in them!). I sort of lost interest in running afterwards - until recently!

It feels like that ""spark"" which spurred me through the training last year is back. I've been upping the mileage over the past few weeks, and after completing only a few longer-distance runs since August I went out and ran 50k today! It was the first time I'd done more than 20ish miles since then, and it felt amazing to be back out there. 

I'm actually signed up the NDW100 this coming August and I'm finally feeling motivated about the training. I think that going into this training block I'm actually in a better position than last year because of all the lessons I learned from the DNF. I'll be sure to experiment a lot more with my nutrition plan so that I can avoid what happened last year (I might finally give tailwind a try!).

When I ran my marathon my watch said 24.3""4800' but the race organizers insisted it was 26.2+5500'. 

I don't expect everything to be in perfect alignment, so just curious. Is this normal and which is more accurate? Does this also mean that if I measure a training run on my watch that I am actually running longer with more vert than my watch says?

## Goals

## Training

I had an issue with my knee that made it so I was unable to run for most of December 2020. By early January, I was able to start building up mileage. I gradually worked up to \~70 miles a week throughout most of March. I was doing cross training on Mondays, tempo runs on Tuesday/Thursdays, easy run on Wednesdays, long run on Saturdays, and a moderate length run on Sundays . During this block, I was also doing some strength training based on information from David and Megan Roche's Happy Runner.

Toward the end of last year I also started paying more attention to cadence and found that I was usually averaging around 150 steps per minute on my typical training runs. Since then, I have been trying to gradually increase that number. I worked up to close to 160 for most of this training block and am planning to work that number up for future blocks.

I had attempted this same route, in the opposite direction, back in August of last year and had to give up about 46 miles into it after dealing with dehydration due to not having enough water to work through the heat.

## Pre-run

I was thinking the route was going to take me between 12 to 16 hours to complete so I setup my pack to have all the food I would need for 17 hours just to be on the safe side. I have done a couple other ultras and have had luck with rotating peanuts, energy gels, and bits of a Clif bar around every 20 minutes, so I used that same strategy for this event. I used the Salomon Adv Skin 12 which had enough room for that food, some first aid supplies, and my 0.6L Katadyn BeFree. I filled up the two 0.5L soft flasks and the Katadyn before starting.

For my attempt in August 2020, I filled up water bottles at drinking fountains along the way. The water fountains were not turned on during this attempt, so I had to rely on pulling water from rivers and lakes with the Katadyn.

The temperatures were going to go from cloudy and 32F in the morning up to 55F and sunny at the hottest part of the day. I started with a warm hat, jacket, and gloves with the plan that I would eventually take off as it got warmer out.

I didn't set any goal time, because I did not want to have any reason to push the pace beyond what I was finding comfortable at the time.

During last year's failed attempt I ran from Gaylord up to Mackinaw City since getting to finish in front of the Mackinaw Bridge seemed like a nice way to close out the day. This time I went Mackinaw City to Gaylord since Gaylord had better post-run vegetarian food options open at the time. The trail is pretty flat so it didn't make a big difference to me running-wise which direction I ran it.

## Run

# Mackinaw City to Cheboygan – 16.3 miles

My wife dropped me off at 5am at the trailhead. I started out with a plan of alternating 9 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. The entire trail is flat so I wanted some ability to mix in walking since there are no hills to hike up. This section was just a straight shot with some trees on either side of the path and the occasional views of Lake Huron. It was rather uneventful as I was able to stick to my eating and drinking plan and kept the pace easy. Highlights included a beautiful sunrise and numerous deer, raccoon, and turkey spottings.

# Cheboygan to Topinabee – 11.9 miles

In Cheboygan, there was a nice facility next to the path that had benches and, in the warmer months, a drinking fountain and bathroom. I used this as an opportunity to switch out my warmer hat and gloves with some lighter ones. I also refilled my two front bottles with what I had stored up in the Katadyn.

Most of this stretch runs along Mullet Lake. The sun started to poke out and there were tons of beachy segments with minimal shade. I was able to find a public boat launch into Mullet Lake where I used the Katadyn to refill all my bottles. I ended up getting one foot soaked, which was a little annoying for a few miles, but then it dried out.

# Topinabee to Indian River – 5.6 miles

There was a nice spot to stop and sit along the path in Topinabee, but I ended up moving past since Indian River was not far ahead and I had just made a stop to fill up bottles. I was able to mostly keep up my pace and eating plan, but started working in some more frequent stretching as I was starting to get more sore.

# Indian River to Wolverine – 9.6 miles

My pace started slowing down a bit here as I was starting to have a tougher time taking in enough water and eating with the heat. I feel like 55F and sunny is probably not too hot for most people, but to a person who had been been training through a Michigan winter the past few months it was hitting me hard. I stopped at the Rondo bridge to sit down, refill all the water bottles, and move some food around.

# Wolverine to Vanderbilt - 10.9 miles

This is where I really started to have some issues.  The sun was beating down pretty hard and I was having a tough time finding a spot to refill water. I was trying to make my water stretch out as best I could, but was definitely not taking in the water I needed. During this time, I kept increasing the amount of time I was walking relative to running. Just as I was switching to only walking, I ended up finding a creek in the shade that looked like it was moving just quickly enough to be alright to filter. I ended up spending some time just sitting in the shade and trying to catch up on food and water intake.

After the break, I started to feel better as I got more water into my system. I was ended up working back to an 8 minute run and 2 minute walk plan.

# Vanderbilt to Gaylord - 7.6 miles

I took one last sitting break in Vanderbilt to recover, shuffle some food/trash around my pack, and move the water from the Katadyn to the front bottles. At this point, my legs were pretty sore. I was getting occasional cramps in my thighs and calves that I was able to walk and stretch my way out of. Besides the cramps, I was able to push through with a relatively consistent 4 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking. I had a group of cows come right up to their feeble-looking fence along the path and stare at me, which made me slow to a cautious walk as I passed them.

After a long day, the idea of just being done took over and I ended up picking up the pace to run my quickest pace of the day and was greeted by my wife with some water, fresh snacks, and new clothes.

## Post-run

We got takeout from Snowbelt Brewery. I got a tater tot waffle covered in mac and cheese. I had a tough time sleeping between feeling too hot or too cold and just general soreness. I was pretty sore the whole next day, but doing some walking, stretching, and using a massager on my legs helped me feel quite a bit better by the end of the day.  The next day I went on a 2 mile run and that really helped speed up the recovery.

I plan on submit the activity to fastestknowntime.com.

I struggled to find running shoes that didn't cause too much discomfort, and after running in several pairs of Nikes and whatever was on sale locally, I ended up truly comfortable for the first time in a pair of Saucony Endorphin Shifts coupled with my aging half-length orthotic inserts.

I ran my first 50k last year in the Shifts and they performed well on light trail and road. However, much of my training this year will be on trail, culminating in an 80km trail run on highly technical trail. Thus, I need some proper trail shoes.

I am looking for a wide toe-box, decent support, and enough comfort for a 10+ hours at a time. Given COVID lockdowns, trying on a selection in store is a ways off - so I'm turning to reddit for advice.

I pushed through the pain for a little while but decided to hang up the shoes for a few months over the winter and I have only now just started running again. However, I keep getting a deep, dull pain in my left hip and lower knee. I've had issues with IT band pain before but the pain in the hip seems different. I've tried stretching, rolling, and changing my run form and shoes, but so far no dice. I've also been trying to get on the bike but have been having pains in my left knee, just below the patella. 

Has anyone experienced issues with hip and knee pain, potentially from overuse? I can't tell if I should see a PT or try more home exercises/workouts before consulting a professional. I'm signed up for a half-Ironman in June so I'd love to be able to get back on the road and in the saddle.

### A seed was planted
Four years ago a physio introduced me to the idea of ultras:
“I was hallucinating by the second night. I tried as hard as I could to descend a never-ending mountain, but it felt like I was under water. It took me hours to realise I had been striving to run uphill, not down”.

I asked what the event was called, and he said The Alpine Challenge. His calm recollection of these absurd impressions intrigued me. I also felt a stab of terror, because I knew that I might be tempted, and saw a possible fate unroll into the future.

### Build-up
Oct 2019: first ultra.

Feb 2020 - Feb 2021: a fantastic set of uninterrupted training blocks between solo ultras. Usually 100k (60M) weeks with ~3000m (10,000ft) of elevation and regular unfocused speedwork. Two overnight adventures including my first 100 mile run.

I worked up to steeper and sketchier terrain than I would encounter in the Alpine Challenge. I linked up appealing remote features through trial and error. This experimentation required problem solving, and conditioned me (to a degree) to exposure as I practised scrambling and basic climbing. I hoped this approach would limit my fears about the race, but I was still very afraid!

The last two months forced me to skip most speedwork, almost all strength training and my peak mileage weeks. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to race even 24hrs before the event. I felt lucky when things aligned and I got the all clear to race.

### About The Race
The Alpine Challenge is a glorious loop that passes through some of the most spectacular country in Australia. The course crests three of the highest peaks in the area: Bogong, Hotham and Feathertop (each is ~2000m or 6,500ft). Its trails are mostly soft underfoot as it travels sparse alpine landscapes, rainforest, misty eucalypt valleys and jagged rocky spurs.

The course is famously hard, even to international runners that are comfortable in higher mountains. People struggle with the snow and fog, the cold, the navigation, the steep rocky descents and the long climbs. In 2019 the DNF rate was above 50%.

### My race
We began in the dark. An icy river crossing shortly after sunrise preceded the first major climb.

There I bumped into a friendly runner I’d met once before. He was friendly, inquisitive and interesting. This was his first miler, and he’d trained well. He too hoped for sub-30 hours, but not at the cost of a DNF - my approach exactly. We ran together and talked. This pleasant chatty vibe was refreshing. I’d never raced with anyone before.

Two loyal helpers had taken time off work and driven seven hours to support my new friend. Their job might have been harder than ours - they were up at three AM and spent the day driving hours between aid stations. I saw up close how selfless and inspiring that is, and how much he appreciated it. I was quite moved. His friends were funny as fuck, which was a nice counter point to our sincere banter.

One of them joined us as pacer for the last third of the race. Have you ever tried to keep a three year old focused on one task for twelve hours? That’s how hard his job was.

At midnight we encountered civilisation - the Harrietville Hotel, a gorgeous pub in a small town which was doubling as an aid station. People often quit here. You’re about 120k in (75M), broken, and nestled in a nice pub between two mountains in a chair by a fire. There is laughter and the sound of beer glasses chinking.  Who in their right mind would leave this heavenly environment to begin the biggest climb and the hardest section of the course. It’s midnight, it’s freezing.

Luckily I have been warned about the seductive dangers of chär by ultra running memes. Chair is dangerous. Chair will swallow you. Must leave chair.

One of my friend’s crew chased me down the street as we left the pub:
“Do you want these?”
He was holding out my thermals and my water bladder.

The next 13km were all uphill. My headtorch died. My backup headtorch died. My friend offered me his backup headtorch and it died. I used my iphone’s torch, but the temperatures caused the battery to plummet, so I walked in the dark between my friend and his pacer, rhythmically stepping off the trail to plan footsteps in the torchlight behind me.

Mt Feathertop’s imposing silhouette appeared when we cleared the treeline, illuminated by the most stars I’d ever seen. I saw a shooting star. This was the moment for me when the race delivered everything I’d hoped for. Three people about to bag a peak at 4am, in the middle of nowhere, under the milky way.

The sunrise from Diamantina Spur was equally beautiful, on all scales from the psychedelic wild flowers and swirling rock formations at my feet to the plunging spur we stood on, to the valley below and the mountains above it, and the profile of Feathertop around us, which we’d just been up. I fucking love my life sometimes. I laughed at how bad my photos were and soaked it in.

If I wanted the sub-30 finish I knew I’d have to maintain a normal weekend long-run pace for the last four hours. Going off on my own didn’t feel right though after twenty four hours of solidarity. The clinching factor was that Strava had shat itself and lost my entire recording. If I ran with my buddy I could tag myself in his recording.

I re-joined my friends and we pushed up the last big climb. Our pacer silently coaxed us into properly running the last 15km (~10M), including all of the uphills. I was happy to be pushing because I knew it would likely stop us from being overtaken, and I calculated that we had a top twenty spot. Wholesome to see my new friend was tearing up and relishing his experience. He held my hand to cross the finish line, but it turned out to be 100m too early. We awkwardly unheld hands, then held them again.

Someone put a beer in my hand. Neither of us puked or bled. Success!

ultrarunning,RatherNerdy,How to train for a last man standing?,"I'm going to sign up for a last man standing race in September.

Details:

* 4.2 mile trail loop. Trails are wide and heavily groomed (imagine woodchipped roads) and hilly. 
* Past winner ended up at 134 miles

&gt; Racing starts at 12 noon on Saturday with a shotgun start. Racers will complete the course at whatever pace they choose, but they MUST complete the loop in less than 60 minutes! Those that complete the course in under an hour will earn the right to continue. The next gun start is at 1pm. Same loop, same rules apply. The race continues in this format until there is only one athlete remaining. The lone athlete must be standing at the starting line ready for the next start to be declared the Last Man Standing and the winner.


Questions:

* How to properly train for this event?
    * Do I concentrate on overall mileage, with long back to backs?
    * Do I train similar to the race structure with same day back to backs?
* Any strategies for this type of event?
* What to do with the 15-20 minutes between loops that will likely get progressively smaller as the race continues?
* Any other advice?",1618614935

I'm looking at doing my first 50 miler as I enjoy ""surviving"" (race against yourself) more than racing at long distances. I've got some experience with adventure races, so I'm not entirely green.

Anyhow, the course is a loop course, so my plan is to keep very little on me and stop every 10 miles to replinish. So on me, I'm thinking a hip pack with a couple of 10oz bottles plus gels, quick fuel. And then peanut butter sandwiches, water, beer, CBD, etc for when I do the 10 mile stops.

In my last 100miler, I avoided caffeine for fear of heart palpitations, the jitters, or just “eventful” trips to the bathroom. I had maybe 3x 50mg caffeine gels in the race. 

Inevitably I was desperately tired from about mile 70 and my alertness was that of a cucumber. Can’t help but think if I took on some more caffeine, things would have been easier.

I’ve been running for almost two decades now and consider myself fairly experienced and in tune with my body. I’ve done many road races and a couple of ultras but now, as of this new year, I became a vegetarian to support my vegan wife. Yes, Vegan is too hard core/disciplined for me and I would not be a happy person without my cheese and eggs. 

Good news is that I’ve made the transition surprisingly well, no easing in, and haven’t noticed any ability loss in my running. I’d say that it’s helped me, in fact, as I feel less heavy in my runs. The drawback? I shit and fart to damn much now - annoying. 

Anyway, to the matter at hand. I have a few ultras I signed up for this year and these will be the first I’ll do as a veggie and I’m somewhat concerned about my caloric intake that I hope to be aided with not only what I carry but on myself.

ultrarunning,emptytrashbagobject,"How do you accommodate the ""format"" mileage training schedules (based on mileage) into the various trail/vert/technical runs that you do your actual training on?","I come from a background of track/road running where all training schedules are done by mileage and pace.   This obviously doesn't work the same when you are doing your training runs on hilly technical trails where a 10k run which would take you 40 minutes on the road takes you an hour and a half on the trails. 

Specifically I am following Hal Koerner's book where his plans are based on mileage.  Is the assumption that you would just run those miles on the same ""type"" of trails you would run the race on?  So if it says to go for an 8 mile run, that run should not be on a flat road but on the similar trail (vertical gain/loss, roots, rocks etc.) as the race?  It obviously vastly changes the amount of time you spend running depending on where you do your run.  It could potentially take you over twice as long to do the same weekly program depending on if you just go out and do the miles on the road or the miles on the trails.

Note: His plan builds in hill training and fartlek runs etc., which is why I'm just not sure if he accounts for where you do the prescribed mileage runs.",1617736459

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation.

While research  has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea  how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. To this end I have designed a survey and I would like to enlist your kind help. I believe that this subReddit is the perfect venue.

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will be using  the data to write several research overviews. When the analysis is completed, I will be only too happy to report back in this subReddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html)

The survey can be found at this link:

[https://www.research.net/r/AdvOutRecOSr](https://www.research.net/r/AdvOutRecOSr)

The survey should take about 20-25 min to complete.

There is  no 'right' or 'wrong' answer. It is all about your perception of risk.

Mobile device users please be aware that SurveyMonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll horizontally or down as well to see everything. I apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

ultrarunning,Laresu,How valuable is a shoe which works for you?,"Hey all,

I know the only thing more annoying than asking for shoe advice is asking ‘why does my knee hurt?’, but I’ve got a more general query than just looking for shoe recommendations.

I began my trail running about 18 months ago in a pair of Salomon Sense Ride 2’s, which have been really good to me. After putting many hundreds of km’s through them, I’ve decided that it’s time for a new pair of shoes. 

I went straight for the Sense Ride 4’s, since that is the current iteration, but found that they seem far more firm under foot than the 2’s, so I’ve been turned off them. So now I’m cast out into the the big wide world of shoes, with endless options at my fingertips - Altra’s, Hoka’s, many shiny new things catching my eye.

I have, however, also been able to find a pair of the ole reliable 2’s online - seemingly one of the last few floating around. Given I have gone 18 months (touchwood) injury free and with no major issues or hotspots/blisters etc. in them, I assume they’re good shoes for me - but because I started my running journey in them, I just don’t know how much ‘better’ things could be, because I’ve never tried anything else. 

I guess the crux of my question is: how value is a reliable shoe? Is it a case of ‘stick with it at all costs, because they’re like gold’, or is it ‘branch out, because it’ll be okay and you’ll most likely be fine with your new shoes (or even better)’? I just haven’t sampled enough shoes to know what I like in terms of stack height, drop, etc., let alone what might prevent/cause injuries to me.

I'm doing the New England Challenge this May (6 days, 6 states, marathon each day). December 2019, I did Four Corners series (similar idea...4 states, 4 days) except for that series I had my parents with me.

I know from Four Corners that things I've got to do as soon as I get to the hotel are: some movement/walking, extra foam rolling, slap on my AirRelax boots, eat some food, and take a nap. I also know I need to plan some extra food on the drive between hotels. I realize I'll be burning a lot of calories each day, but I also don't think I should just plan to eat pizza/quick gas station food each day either. That seems like it will catch up with me by day 4-6. I also learned that while I needed to eat, at the end of the day, my ability to eat a lot was somewhat limited, so calorie dense is a bonus (I did a lot of tuna pasta salad during Four Corners).

I'm looking for advice on  
\- Easy road foods that I can either make the night before in a hotel room for post-race travel (was thinking maybe PB&amp;J sandwiches)?  
\- Food for eating in the afternoon/evening to refuel once I'm at the hotel. Hopefully things that I might be able to make prior to leaving and will keep for a little over a week (I'm driving, so I can pack a cooler). Or things that I can have the components and can easily make in the hotel.  
\- Other food/nutrition options that I should plan to bring with me. I won't have anyone to make a grocery run for me, so the less I need to travel out after each day, the better it seems.  
\- Anything else I should consider in terms of logistics.  
\- Contingency planning: What should I do if I get to next hotel and I can't check in for a few hours

I'm confident in my ability to tackle the series since I did Four Corners, which was much more technically difficult running (trails, lots of elevation), but I don't have much prior experience with regards to logistics of making this as easy for myself to be successful managing it. For what it's worth also, I'm hoping to finish in about 5hrs for each day of racing.",1617214736

GoalDescriptionCompleted?AFinish*Yes*BEnjoy it*Yes*

### Training

I posted at the beginning of the month here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/lupzl1/challenge\_496\_advice\_required/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/lupzl1/challenge_496_advice_required/)

I have consistent 50k weeks over the last 9 months but this was a last minute idea and i am not sure how i would even train for it. A huge step

### Pre-race

I had a down week to prepare but nothing else to note. A huge part of this challenge would be logistics and i am working from home due to lockdown, we have a 4 month old baby, a dog and my wife (freelancer) is back working nights. This led to a pretty mad schedule as the month progressed where our day looked like this:

7.00am - Get baby up, have something light to eat

8:00am - Nanny arrives and i run for 60 mins with dog

9-12 - work, sneak out for lunch run, wife gets up

5:00pm - nanny leaves, i take baby out for run (catnap) + dog

6-7.15pm - bedtime etc for baby

7.30pm we eat

9:00pm I go to bed, wife leaves for work

2:00am - i do night feed

5:00am - wife gets back from work, i get up and run 

7:00am - i get baby up...

Due to this slightly bonkers schedule i knew i could not 1 bang each run as there was no way i could get 2+ hours free at one time. Therefore, i planned to split days into multiple runs.

I had two pairs of shoes to rotate between, Reebok Floatride Energy 3 Shoes and NB 1080 v11's.

I tried to do a 15 minute flexibility routine each day (bodyweight warrior on youtube) but this did fall away as the month went on. I concentrated on stretching my glutes and used a massage gun on my calves

### Race

I nailed day 1! My plan was to run at a really low heart rate (i use Garmin 945 + chest strap) with a target HR of &lt;130. This equates to 6 minute km's for me, slower with baby in tow.

I chugged away through the first 2 weeks with no dramas. Mentally i felt like day 21 would be the first mental barrier and that was my goal. I had a post run mini bonk on about day 17 which was a reminder of how important hydration is - lesson learnt. Once a day, after the longest run, i would take some SiS Rego powder with frozen berries and milk as my recovery drink + a hydration tablet. Other than that i just ate a normal diet - i did eat whatever i wanted, whenever i wanted. Interestingly i put on about 1kg during this but am not sure if it is my body freaking out or just me going a bit mad with Deliveroo. 

Running with a running buggy is hard, especially 15k+ and i really felt it in my glutes on the next non buggy run. This would have been impossible with a running buggy and it was enjoyable to share the experience with the baby. 

I listened to alot of podcasts, audiobooks and Spotify during the runs using Aftershokz headphones which i would highly recommend. 

I did day 25 in a 1 bang before work as my wife wasnt working and felt great, the next goal being getting to the 27th as this was the weekend which was normally easier. Unfortunately the baby got a cold which meant he stopped sleeping more than an hour which left me running on fumes somewhat. This challenge was never going to be straightforward and i kept positive, ticking off the runs and the days.

I found the 28th to be the hardest as i had a couple of beers the night before, no sleep and the cumulative effort was telling. The 3rd run of the day, a 9k with running buggy was seriously hard but once done i knew i would finish the whole thing.

I took day 31 off work so i could do it in 1 and met my cousin who was also doing the challenge. We  chatted round and i enjoyed the last 5k on my own. I really enjoyed the interest and support on Strava/friends/work and wanted to write this up to share the idea and see if anyone else wants to take it on.

### Post-race

I have a bottle of bubbles in the fridge and am going to nail a pizza tonight. I reckon i will be asleep before the 2nd glass and 3rd slice!

I have no real injuries to report, just a few niggles but thats to be expected. I have a small blister on my left foot and i bruised the top of my right foot on about day 27 as either i did my laces up too tight or my foot swelled up (or both). I plan to take the next two week easy but do lots of walking and active recovery and then do a 70k run in June.

ultrarunning,Bisto74,Foot bump,"Hi all

I've had a strange bump appear on my left foot after having run 11 miles back in December and it does not want to go away.

Doesn't particularly hurt but about a 3 on the irritation scale.

I've had 2 X-rays that have come back all clear and I've seen a Podiatrist who checked everything mechanically and seems to think it's fine. The reality is though I've done something to it and it seems that I'm now getting a Bunion which apparently can happen as a resort of a foot  trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual suspects have been ruled out and logic would lean towards some sort of joint damage.

Last year I actually put in more miles running (371 total) than I ever have, though my overall steps were way down from working from home.  I am pacing a pretty rigorous ultra in June, with my expected contribution to be the last 30 miles of a 67 mile race.  In January, I started upping my mileage, and it felt good while running, but the recovery has been terrible.  I got up to 28 miles in the third week of January but the recovery from muscle soreness has been miserable.  Right now I seem to only be able to do 10-20 miles a week.  

I have been trying to supplement running with resistance bands and yoga, but every minor workout takes a week to recover from.  I am 42 years old, 5'10"" and 195 pounds so I am no spring chicken.  I take a daily multivitamin, Flaxseed, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, and Calcium and Magnesium.  I use a lacrosse ball and foam roller daily.

I am a graduate student in the Kinesiology department at San Francisco State University. I'm conducting qualitative research on the experiences and lives of participants in the sports of ultradistance trail running, adventure racing, and triathlon.

**I'm working to recruit one to two more participants who fit the following criteria:**

1. You are an ultradistance runner (meaning, you have at least one running event of 50k or further that you prepare for throughout the year)
2. You have at least 3 years experience in the sport
3. You are 18 to 29 years old
4. IF (this is not a requirement) you are a student and/or parent, I would be especially interested in recruiting you to participate in this research.

*Participation in this research includes 3 parts: First, I’ll ask you to complete a demographic questionnaire using an online form. Then, I'll ask you to participate in an individual interview via Zoom, taking between 1.5 to 2 hours, focusing on the ways your sport participation affects your life and the ways your life affects your sport participation. Finally, I may contact you within three months of your interview with a few follow-up questions that will take about  15 minutes to answer. The total time participating in this research will be about 2.5 hours.*

ultrarunning,LargelyLucid,Loss of Meaning with Injury,"Making this post here because nobody in my life would understand how important running has become. There are a million articles online I can read about this, surely, but here is me expressing another anecdote. 

Have had metartarsalgia in outer most metatarsal joint for the past month or so. It wasn't so bad for a while and never hurt while running, only slight gait differences when waking in middle of the night. It only got so bad a few weeks ago following a 100 mi wk and self-supp 50 mi that I've had to stop running against my will. (I know, maybe I flew too close to the sun, like my man Icarus). We can likely only blame ourselves when our wings are burning.

2 weeks off from running has me slipping. When running has saved you from past vices, they come rising back when running is not there. First week off was not so bad. Substituting with biking was fun, but only because I thought I might return to running the next week or week after next.

ultrarunning,thatcrazyrunnergirl,How I won the first ultramarathon I ran (50 miles) race recap/my training,"Hello ultrarunners of reddit- new member here, so great for us to have this community! 

Last week I ran my first ever 50 mile ultramarathon (St. George Lake to Lake 50 mile) and somehow managed to swoop in for 1st place in the women's ultra. Ran 9:43, which I know is not such a crazy amazing time to write home about, I was a bit disappointed since I had planned to not only break 9 hours, but really wanted to break 8 hours.... and I thought I could based on my training... but things don't always go how you plan them. 

Training: 

First off, really stepped up my weekly volume from previously 45-60 MPW, gradually going all the way up to 80 MPW. That was definitely scary for me, but my body adapted so well, I honestly felt like I could've done more, but of course, since it was my first ultra, I didn't want to push things and get injured. 

2) I really amped up my strength training for this training block. Previously, when I finally managed to qualify for Boston (3 times now) I noticed adding a little bit of strength training to my routine paid out HUGE dividends, so I decided if I really wanted to run longer, faster, and stronger, I needed to kick it up a notch in that department. I pretty much doubled the length of my workouts (squats, lunges, core work, resistance band training for hips and glutes etc.) and added more plyo training i.e. jump squats. After mostly all of these workouts I was sore the next day, but I tried to balance it (with decent success) so that I wouldn't be so sore that when I went to run it would get in the way. After I got warmed up the soreness would quiet down. 

3) Speed work 2x a week with lots of variety. Sometimes longer tempo runs, some progression runs, mile repeats, yassos, just tried to switch it up every week to something different. 

4) long runs. I did back to back long run every weekend (shorter 10-15 mile distance on Sat and then 30-40 mile distance on Sunday). Basically all of my long runs (maxing out at 10/40 back to back Saturday/Sunday) I was able to run at 9:30 or less a mile. So I was really planning on running under 8 hours on the race. Sadly, on dice for me this time around. I really wish somehow I could've gotten some heat training in... I knew my race was going to be in St. George, but it was March and I was hoping the heat wouldn't really hit me this early in the year. But alas, giant heat wave came in just the weekend of my race bringing temps from mid 50s up near the 80s just for me. That pretty much killed me for a good 3 hours where I was running 12 minute miles.  

Race Day: 

Got started at 7am at killed it, right on target pace for the first 25 miles. I was doing great on hydration, nutrition, heart rate zone, no blisters, everything... Of course then day heated up and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I kept dunking my shirt in water to keep myself cool, but it was still brutal. I do badly in the heat just in general, way worse than the average runner. But especially coming from training all winter long in Utah (my hottest run was when I trained on the course 3 weeks prior and it was 50 degrees) I just couldn't handle it very well. I did manage to keep running, at least, never had to stop and walk (other than very short intervals on really steep and gravelly hills where I just felt like running was inefficient). But in the end, it didn't matter too much as it turned out the women's field competition was not very steep, and 9:43 was enough to snag 1st place after all. 

Definitely will be coming back and trying to break that 8 hours barrier though...

ultrarunning,drifterlately,Book help: Training for the Uphill Athlete vs Training for the New Alpinism? Or other?,"I’ve got a friend who is my running partner and her birthday is coming up. She’s a really strong runner, and since we’ve both got ultras this year (my first, she did one last year) I would really like to get her a book to that could help with training or just otherwise be good info to know. For comparison, she and I both really like Science of Running by Chris Napier.

She also rock climbs and has summited a few PNW peaks, so she’s passionate about mountaineering as well. One thing she really doesn’t enjoy is skiing!

Which book would be better choice? Is Uphill Athlete too focused on skiing? Is New Alpinism not focused on running at all? I couldn’t quite find specifics but read good reviews - but I did read they overlap a lot and I wouldn’t need to buy both.

One thing she and I both want to learn more about is running nutrition - if there is a book that has good info on how the body functions during endurance sports and what nutrients are required and do what/go where, that would be really good. More science, not someone’s opinion on what food tastes good during a marathon.

ultrarunning,ukclimb,Watch recommendation,"I replaced my Suunto Spartan Ultra with a Suunto 9 Baro last week which i've just sent back. It measured altitude accurately but surprisingly the way it measured total ascent / descent was much less accurate. I had some big discrepancies in performance mode and was plain wrong when compared against my old Spartan. The wrist HR was widely inaccurate although I wasn't expecting much from it.

So back to the drawing board for a new watch, my criteria is:-

Use - trail running and mountaineering, mainly UK.

Accurate ascent/descent and altitude. Needs an altimeter/barometer.

Navigation - breadcrumb at the least. Ability to upload gpx files. Colour maps nice but not essential.

Battery - at least 24 hrs (need to be able to use in navigation mode for up to 24hrs).

HR monitor - after my experience with the 9 I really have zero confidence in these now. But if there is an accurate one i'd be interested, otherwise I have a chest belt so this feature is not essential.

Design - it would be nice to have a sleek design for a change. The Spartan/9 Baro are cumbersome under a running jacket sleeve or mountain gloves.

Price - any

Think that about covers it for the main features but happy to add anything in i've forgotten about.",1615832253

ultrarunning,mannidung,Running 5x a week w/ Double day vs. 6 days a week,"Morning all!

I'm starting a mileage increase phase for a 90k in August, and I'm considering two different approaches. I currently run 5 times a week with two rest days. My mileage is around 50-60k per week and I aim to (slowly) increase to 70-90k per week.

I'm choosing between the following ways to increase the mileage:

1. Run 6 times a week, decreasing to one rest day. This would probably be a run of about one hour in length.

2. Take one of my workout days (I run my WO in the morning) and run once more in the afternoon/evening (easy run). This would probably be a run of 30-60 mins depending on how the schedule for the evening is.

My reasoning is the following.

Pros:
1. I would get a couple of more km in every week compared to 2, and I can do this run in the morning, which makes it less stressful.

2. I would keep 2 rest days each week, and according to a Koop podcast (can't remember which), an extra rest day decreases the risk of injury substantially.

Cons: 
1. I would lose one rest day.

2. Some weeks it might be hard to fit in a second running the evening due to job stuff.

I'm not able to find any good literature on this and would love to hear if you have tried one way or the other (or even both), and what your experiences have been. Which one would you go with?",1615715252
ultrarunning,dustinlocke,Sleepy during long runs?,"Today during my long run I experienced something I’ve only had happen once before: around three hours in, I got super sleepy while running. Like all I wanted was to lay down and close me eyes. Got a bit better when I ate some Skittles and then came back until the end of the run around 4:15 total time. 

I had a big breakfast and had eaten 400 calories and 100mg caffeine during the run. Got seven hours of sleep last night, though haven’t slept great this week and had a pretty big training day yesterday. 

This happened to me during a winter race last year when I caught myself repeatedly looking for napping spots in the snow. 

I run quite a bit. Have finished two marathons, four 50k, a 64k, and a 50 mile and all the corresponding training and this has only happened to me twice.

ultrarunning,rollocking,Need advice: Training for my first 50k and Olympic triathlon at the same time,"Quick background on me: I’ve run a handful of marathons and will be training for my first ultra (50k so barely an ultra, but on trail with decent elevation gain close to 10k) through this spring for a race in early august. Due to race cancellations and delays from the past year, I also have an Olympic triathlon race in late July, and so I’ll be having to balance training for both in overlap for quite a while, basically until it’s time to taper for the trail 50k.

Currently, my weekly baseline routine puts me at about 20-30 mpw running, with maybe 10-15 of that in trail, and 50-100 mpw biking. I lift twice a week for injury prevention and as the weather gets nice I plan to throw in some swim/run split days. Obviously I’ll have to be bumping my weekly mileage to somewhere around 50-60 mpw at least for the ultra with way more on trail, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get the most bang for your buck in terms of avoiding injury and sneaking in some other workouts on the bike.

I’m comfortable at this point that I could easily get through the triathlon no problem, although of course I want to be competitive. The ultra scares me a bit more. I know this is an entirely self-induced problem, but has anyone here done something similar or have advice on cross training vs. running split?

I recently purchased a pair of Lone Peak 5's (still returnable) but I'm not feeling great about the fit.

ultrarunning,EconomicRunner,Koop’s steady state runs,"I’m wondering if anybody could give me a bit of insight into these workouts. Despite Koop’s advice, I do generally use HR to guide most of my runs but I am trying to be increasingly more mindful of RPE. 

Koop prescribes steady state runs at an RPE of 7 and as I’m a bit new to RPE as well as steady runs in general, I’m looking for a rough HR equivalent.

For reference, I typically run (with estimated RPE):

- very easy/recovery ~125-135bpm (RPE 4-5)
- easy/endurance ~135-150bpm (RPE 5-6)
- tempo/threshold ~ &lt;178bpm (RPE 9)
- vo2 Max ~ &gt;178bpm (RPE 10)

I would think an RPE of 7 would land me somewhere around 160bpm. Koop seems to suggest these runs should be closer to the threshold side without tipping over (perhaps around 165), whereas others seem to reference steady runs at a slightly more laboured aerobic effort (perhaps more like 155).

As long as you’re ready to start the new loop each hour, you continue racing. You go until there’s only one runner left who is able to complete the loop in 60 minutes. 

As one who’s never raced an ultra, or even a marathon for that matter, i am the epitome of a beginner, so I’m doing it just to try it out and see what I’m capable of and push the limits. My goal would likely be 7 laps (28ish miles). I’m here just wondering what are some tips you may have that a rookie may not think about, and what can I expect as far as pain, mentality, etc, when those later home stretch miles hit. Any help much appreciated! I’m pumped regardless!",1614804241

ultrarunning,imryel,Hydration options for 3+ hours besides vests,"I'm training for my first 50k as a fairly slow runner (10 minute miles easy pace, but I walk all the uphills on my hilly long runs, so I end up averaging 12-13 minute miles).  My long runs are starting to hit around 3 hours, and I am looking for ideas for hydration.  I have shoulder issues (had a labral tear several years ago and it hurts a lot to wear running vests due to the lack of frame.  I can hike with a frame backpack with hip belt, but is very uncomfortable to run in)

Today, I am using the Ultraspire Speedgoat 3.0 waist belt.  I really like it and plan to use it for the race when there are plenty of aid stations,  It holds 1.1L of water, which is just barely sufficient for 3 hours, but as I continue to ramp up (hoping to peak between 20-23 miles)

So I am looking for non-vest options to hold 1.5-2L of water.  Has anyone had luck adding additional bottles to a waist belt?  I've considered also carrying a handheld, but then could never use poles and I suspect it would feel awkward (but I haven't tried!).  I've also considered getting the smallest hiking pack I can find that still has a frame and a hipbelt, like the Osprey Talon 22, but am worried that it may chafe or the water will slosh around a lot.  

Interested to see what strategies others have used!  Worst case, I can do two smaller routes and refill at my car in between (my local routes don't have any water on the trail to purify), but I'm much more interested in staying out the whole time",1614726089

I been looking around, and the natural choice would be a fenix series or FR945 (745 maybe?), but I far from using and understaning the amount of information and complexity tha those options produce - don't misunderstand me they are fantastic watches, but I doubt that I'm gonna use all the features they have. 

The thing is, I wanted to track my activities and have a good measure of them but not ending buying an expensive watch that I'll not use all their capability (likely too bulky)- I really like the recovery advisor of my 735xt thoug.

ultrarunning,joejance,"Aerobic Threshold Tests, HR vs PRE questions","Has anyone done an aerobic threshold test to set up training zones? Nose breathing test? Self administered blood lactate test? The full lab run? Did you get benefit from it?

Last year was my first year tackling actual ultras. When I started my training for last year I switched to using Perceived Rate of Exertion to guide the intensity of my training runs (based on Jason Koop's book). 

Before then I had run a variety of sub-ultra distance races. Back then I had setup HR zones on my watch based on my LT (discovered using a track test) and resting HR, using Garmin's HRR% algorithm. Switching to PRE seemed natural to me, as HR seemed really variable on trail and from day to day.

Now I'm training for a 50 mile trail ultra this summer, which will be my longest run with most elevation gain. I'm in the middle of reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and the authors discuss aerobic threshold and heart rate zones *a lot*. They have me thinking about my aerobic base again, and I'm questioning if my PRE 4-5 runs really are under my aerobic threshold.

Let's say I do an aerobic threshold test and discover I'm aerobic deficient. Do I go back to use HR to guide my runs? Try to readjust what PRE means to me? Am I overthinking this?",1614366777

### Goals

| B | Don’t die | *Yes* |
| A | Finish race | *YES* |


### 1: Disclaimer and 2: what the hell am I talking about:
1: Don't do this shit. 2: I got the brilliant idea of running an ultramarathon on LSD after a bucket list discussion at work. Doing things like climbing everest and running ultras came up, as did taking some of the drugs you've never tried. I thought that combining these things would make for a fun year to remember.

### Training
Running back and forth to work on weekdays (about six three miles one way) in order to prepare for running a 50 mile ultramarathon. Long runs on weekends. Taking LSD to see if I can handle it.  I could, and I enjoyed it enough to keep going with my experiment.

Running one 10K event on LSD: it was a success and the most fun I’ve ever had in a night!  

### Pre-race

The wife drove me to the starting line out in the woods as I was still sleeping. Thank you wifey. 

I felt like an outsider once we got to where the race was starting off. Everyone was wearing stuff that looked like it was designed for running, while I was wearing woolen underwear and gray gym shorts and a green hoodie above them. Others were wearing skimpy hydration packs, I wore an old hiking backpack I had used while backpacking over in Europe. And everyone and their mother had these GPS watches that probably cost more than all of my stuff + race fee combined. 

I was surprised to see that 3/10, maybe even 4/10 of the runners were women. A large number of the men were bearded. How many of them had plastic bags of LSD in their pockets I didn’t know, but they were quiet a hippie-looking-bunch of people none the less. 

### Race
### 

It was dark when the race started at six in the morning, and it made for a cool atmosphere with all the headlamps when the gun went off. Some 150 people I would guess were there to prove themselves during the day that followed. 

The hoodie went into the backpack fast as I got warm from running. We ran the first part of the race next to a lake that reflected all the stars, which was nice. While those aiming for glory and first place had sprinted off in the beginning, most people where still in one big pack. Hearing the all the shoes hit the gravel in unison had me feeling this was much more of a teams sport than it was. People were talking about what prior races they had run, what injuries they had fought over the year and what nutrition they had brought. While I didn’t find myself all that interested in the subjects other runners were bringing up, one of the biggest surprises was how connected I felt to the people I was out with. Running an entire night with a group of people like could probably be a spiritual experience on its own.


### Ninety Minutes after ingestion - where is my high?
Ninety minutes had passed since I had put the tabs of LSD in the mouth, and I had run some 15 miles and taken nearly 30-thousand steps according the the wife’s Fitbit on my wrist. On 200 micrograms I would definitely have expected to be tripping by now, but I was kinda bummed out thinking this wouldn’t work out until really I found myself really sad thinking of all the people who died and lost friends and family in the 2004 tsunami. All feelings are amplified on psychedelics, but I would have very much liked another feeling than sadness to amplify on this day. 

At least getting distracted was easy thanks to the girl in the ponytail I started following who held a good pace for me. Focusing on their hair swinging left and right like a pendulum made for a good thing to focus on. The packs had thinned out some time ago, and now people were sorted by speed into different groups - I had made my way from one of the slower ones to one that was a bit more ambitious. 

I was admiring the woman ahead of me. She was quite obviously well trained by the looks of her legs and butt, but I felt strongly connected to her to the point of embarrassment when I thought about how we were both out here on this day going through the same hardships. 

Was I in love? I don’t know, but I remember thinking about our potential life together. Full of running adventures all over the world, and our babies would be genetically engineered to be great endurance athletes. It got me feeling very warm, but also crying. Splitting with the wife who I had been with for more than 10 years would be hella tough, but I had to be true to myself. Of course I was just high, and not in love, but it was very much the reality I was facing at the time. 


Like the last time I had run on LSD, the visual effects were greatly diminished. Things were fluid, wavy and non-solid, but it was very mild compared to what I would usually be seeing on this kind of dose. Could the tabs I had brought be under-dosed? Sure, you can’t really know how much you are getting, but the other effects were still going strong. The body was constantly tingling, and it felt like an electric current was going back and forth in my body powering me. Sometimes I felt light as a feather, and at other times I felt more like a brick. 

The path went mostly on trails through the woods. The area was very beautiful, and I thought about how lucky the people who lived on the farm I passed during the sunrise where. I wanted to live on a farm!

### Super Mario:

I was in a two man pack followed by a mustache-clad man in a red windbreaker jacket. I called him Mario, and he had followed me for some time now. If he knew how far out I was at the moment he wouldn’t be, but following the red stripes that showed the way made for easy navigation ever someone as high as I was. But when the red stripes disappeared, he acted as if it was my fault the we had gotten a bit lost. “Just brilliant!” he had exclaimed before he turned back. Luckily I could follow him on the way back to the trail, and we had only been a little bit off. 

He seemed to care about his time, unlike me. I only wanted to finish the race. But why? I wasn't sure. Why does anyone do anything?


### Doesn't taste like anything to me!

The halfway point was coming up, and I had already done the longest run of my life. Almost a marathon on LSD - not bad at all, I must say! While there had been moments of sluggishness, I had mostly felt very energetic since the drug had started to work its magic on me. I was no longer in love with ponytail girl, but we kept running into each other every now and then, and mustache man I assumed was far ahead of me. 

After a grueling hill me and ponygirl reached the aid station on top of a cliff, overlooking a cute little lake. A volunteer asked me if I wanted something to drink, and I said please. Talking was difficult with  my jaw clenching, and I had to resist a sudden urge to giggle. I noticed how weird her expression was: patches of skin on her face were twirling in spirals, and her large nose was growing and shrinking rapidly. Nothing in her face really made sense. I got a coffee from her and filled up on water, and sat down alone on a nice rock, from which I could see Mr. Mustache eat and talk with some other runners.  

There were snacks and food available here, but I went for the egg and avocado sandwhich I had brought with me. I hadn't eaten since last night, but I wasn't hungry at all. Which was for the best, because when I took a bite I couldn't feel taste. It was just texture of the food, which disgusted me. I spat out the mush, and the aid station coffee as well. Undrinkable. At least the day was nice, and as I sat down the hallucinations started to grow stronger. What looked like waves swept over the forest below, and the cliffs surrounding the lake moved up and down like whack-a-moles. Suddenly I felt as if I was in a bubble underwater, and the words b, fourteen, down came back to me. What did they mean?

As I heard ponytail girl crack and joke and others laugh at it, the bubble popped, and I was back, ready to hit the road. And despite having run 24 miles, longer than I had ever run before, I wasn’t really that tired. Is LSD a performance enhancer? I don't know, but it definitely is a pain and fatigue remover. 

###That time LSD made me gay. 

I could not move my gaze from his butt. The cheeks were like two bowling balls of pure muscle, sculpted by Michelangelo himself. They were firm, yet at the same time bouncy. How the hell would I tell my darling wife that I now liked men? Is this what LSD does to you - or was it the running? 

Whatever it was, I was now gay. What man wouldn't be, when looking at that fine piece of man-butt in front of me? 

### Old men, green particles, and the end of it all

I'm not gonna lie - that later half was tough. Real tough. I was coming down, the peak was gone, and I had been running as if it was my day job. Often walking too, I must say - no first time ultrarunner runs the entire distance on his first race. At times I questioned myself wondering why the hell I was doing this. Was I having fun? I was in pain. Especially during the asphalt sections that popped up every now and then. The lungs worked fine, but it was the constant pounding on the legs that was wearing me out. 

As I stopped to pee I felt as if I  was surrounded by green particles flying in the air. I could see them both with eyes open and closed, and it was very comforting. Many times during the few LSD trips I had undergone I had felt like there was someone watching over me, a force of some kind, and it was good. Even if it was my mind making up this feeling, it felt real enough.  

The green particles stayed with me for the much of the remainder of the race, and it did ease my pain somewhat. How the mind does that is strange, but that's what it did. I had a feeling that I would be experiencing this even if I hadn't taken any LSD earlier, but that was impossible to know.  Maybe this was the real runner's high that some athletes talk about? 

Someone who seemed to be in a lot of pain was the old man me and a group of four runners passed with only a few miles to go. He must've been sixty years old, and he was limping, and took a break to hold on to his knee when we reached him.  We had been out for shy of ten hours, and just now were we catching up to this dude who looked like he could have grown up grand-children. That was impressive. Who knew how long he had been limping out here? He told us it was ok to keep going, and that's what we did. As did he, slowly limping his way to the finish line. 

Ultramarathons are for most people not very comppetetive. It's about finishing, and for some people, it's about finishing while tripping on LSD. But as I and two other runners reached the road that would in only a few hundred yards lead to the finish line I noticed one of them picking up the speed behind me. Game on! his friend shouted ""I'm not doing this!"" but as long as there are two, ther there are enough people to tango. 

Soon we were on a racetrack, torches on both sides of it, and at the end was the finish line. It looked like the kind of place where tribes would sacrifice virgins to appease the ancient gods, and I could hear my wife shouting at me as I reached the bend that took me to the final stretch of the race. My lungs were screaming for air - we had been keeping a hard pace for at least half a mile, and now we were side by side with only one hundred meters to go. Not even  Usain Bolt would have been able to run past any of us then and there! The man next to me gave it all, but so did I - and a little more. I was faster than him, but we were both winners, both smiling just as much. I couldn't imagine a better way to finish my first ultramarathon.


### Post race thoughts:
 
I was proud of myself when I finished. I hadn't just finished a 50 mile ultramarathon in 10 hours and 23 minutes  - I had finished an almost year long project. Sure, I hadn't made the world a better place nor had I invented something cool, but I had stuck with something tough for the first time in my life. The LSD part had been really fun, and psychedelics had shown me another piece of the world I didn't know existed, but I think what I had learned was how rewarding it felt to.. do stuff. A friend who had hiked the Appalachian trail had talked about the sense of  purpose he had felt during that ordeal, and that was how I felt during this whole thing. And now what?

As me and the wife headed home in the car, I spotted the old man limping on the road leading up to the finish line. I was impressed with what I had accomplished, but this dude was built with stronger bricks than most. Why the hell would he keep going like that? Then I remembered one thought I had been having a few times over the race  - sometimes it is at your worst, you feel the best. 


What followed the next few days was pain. So much pain, especially during toilet visits. How anyone runs even longer events was hard to fathom. But despite this, it didn't take long for me to sign up for another ultramarathon, which I would do sober. And guess what? I twisted my knee and had to drop out. Perhaps a sign I shouldn’t be racing with a clear mind. 

More LSD adventures? A few, but no more more reckless run/trip combos. Last LSD trip was 2019. Some slight interest to redo this one day, but nothing serious.

I started to feel knee pain and eventually went to a physio who told me to do a few things to strengthen my quads and glutes, he said to keep running. 

I then did a silly thing and ran the Yorkshire 3 peaks (40k) and afterward, my knee was fried. 

I didn't run again for weeks to let it heal and went to a physio who basically said id overdone it too quickly. 

I've been doing eccentric decline squats, progressing from two legs, to one leg, and now adding weight). 

I've been doing this religiously but I feel like I'm not making any progress. Most of the time when I perform the exercises it hurts, I get the odd day when it doesn't. The physio said to slowly start to run again as in for 5 mins, then 10, then 15.. which I did, but it got too sore again so I just stopped and decided I wanted to fully heal before I try and run again.

Obviously, I'm itching to get back to running BUT i want to heal.

I've been doing these squats for probably about 9 weeks now and I'm starting to feel a little deflated.

Has anyone else found anything else that works for them?

Willing to try anything at this point!

ultrarunning,Local-Document-6815,Am I on track for my 50k goal time?,"Not experienced as a runner so wanted some outside opinions on my progress (+ advice) as I don't have much to compare to. Race goal and recent TT results below. Appreciate any feedback.

My target race is early September, 54km (33mi) trail race with 1,100m (3,600ft) vert, is my target time of &lt;4hr30min realistic? It would require an avg pace of &lt;5min/km (8min/mi).

I turn 30 in a month or two, height 188cm (6""2), weight 74kg (163lbs), active but never a runner per se. Football (soccer) in high school, 5 years military, exercised on and off over the past 5 years. I've always been in ok shape, like I could run a 5k in under 30min 'off the couch', but not much of training history as a runner specifically.

I started running in Nov 2020, after 15 weeks decided to do a HM TT to see where I'm at, results below. This was run doing multiple loops, with one short, steep climb accounting for the vert on each lap, the rest was flat asphalt/trail.

HM TT
Time: 1:35:17
Pace: 4:31min/km (7:15min/mi)
Elevation Gain/loss: 194m (636ft)

This was run consistently at 85-90% maxHR (estimate as I don't know my true MHR) at the end of week 15 of training, no taper or extra rest just did this as my long run. Big effort, had nothing left when finished.

Training to date:
Weeks 1 - 12 were base building up to ~70km (45mi) per week with almost no running done above an RPE of 6, last 3 weeks have been at ~80km (50mi) per week with 2x hill sprint sessions per week (12 x 1min max effort on 6 - 10% grade). Running done on a 50/50 split between road and trail, average about 10m per km in vert (about 50ft per mile) in elevation gain.

Plan is to do another 3 week block of hill sprints, then around 8 weeks of tempo running work, then 12 weeks of specific work for the race itself at lower intensity but higher mileage (peak 120km/80mi per wk).",1613998358

ultrarunning,datastand,Medical certificate for race entry,"I'm entered into the PDA, support race to the Val D'Aran by UTMB race in Spain this summer. As part of the entry I have to submit a ""medical certificate"" to show i'm able to run this race. The deadline to submit this is over 2 months away. 

I emailed my local GP/Doctors practice (i'm UK based), thanked them for their hard work with the current situation and making sure older ones/my parents are getting vaccination appointments etc, and explained that i didn't want to appear as selfish (given the current priorities) but i simply wanted to enquire about the process of getting the medical certificate completed because it was something i've not had to do before.

An email reply arrived within an hour saying that if i emailed back proof of id, the form would be completed and upon payment of a fee it would be emailed back. For reference the form is here, https://www.aranbyutmb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Certificado-medico-ENG-2021-1.pdf and needs only the doctors name, date of birth, stamp and signature &amp; date.

I had (wrongly) assumed there would be some form of in-person verification at the very least to see that i appeared capable of running the race (virtual perhaps given the current circumstances?!). This turned out to not be the case and i was taken aback by the fee they were going to charge for the ""work"" of filling in the form.   

I asked about the reason behind this, to which the response was:

""I’m sorry but that is our standard fee for a short report. 

When a GP puts their signature to a document, this is confirming that in their clinical view the person and the facts are sound.  This carries a risk but their professional training and expertise enable them to undertake the work.  As this work is outside the core GP work, a charge has to be made for their time and expertise.""

To which i replied:

""Thanks for clarifying, i appreciate the legal aspect of signing a document and the professional and reputation risk that this subsequently brings. 

I think on reflection i had initially expected at least some form of in-person verification but as it sounded like it was just a case of having a form filled in and emailed back on receipt of payment it struck me by surprise. If that is the case, how much ""professional training and expertise"" comes into it? And how can i be ""clinically viewed as sound""?  

I am genuinely intrigued by this (it's the first time i've had to sort anything like this out), sorry if my initial assumptions were incorrect :) 

Am i correct in understanding there is no in-person verification, but i can send proof of id via email and then payment when asked for and the form is just email back?""

I've had no response from this, so at this point i have a couple of thoughts;

1. The 'fee' is justified by the doctors ""professional training and expertise"" but the reality is it is filling in 4 lines of a form!! This doesn't seem to make sense.

2. What is the point of a 'medical certificate' for the organisers if it's just a case that a doctors surgery can sign and stamp it and then send it away, with zero actual verification. Is it purely for insurance/other purposes?! 

If it is just a case of getting a form signed, i'll look for a more sensibly priced 'service', but again it seems to defeat the point of it. Or is it my GP/doctors surgery and how they're reacting to it? Or, if Val D'Aran actually want a genuine medical check i'm more than happy to pay for it. Something just doesn't seem to add up at the moment. Or, lastly, is it a Covid specific case and it was different before? Has anyone had any similar concerns/questions or any sensible solution or advice please? Appreciate your thoughts :)",1613864132

I'm racing the Tushar 100k then Run Rabbit Run both later this year. I live in the Midwest and wanted to get out of town for a few days and get some miles in at altitude. Partially for fun, other part training.  

I'm looking at late May/early June. I'm torn between two options and having never done anything like this before - looking for some honest feedback. 

Option 1: Westen States Training Camp
Its easy in that I dont really have to plan or cover any logistics. The canyon temperatures will hopefully give me some exposure to the Tushars race, that one can get pretty hot too (not triple digits but lots oft time in the sun). It has built in aid stations. Obviously lots of other runners there and people to connect with. I'm naturally shy so not sure how this would go. 

Option 2: DIY Adventure in New Mexico 
Its be similar to Option 1, three days of training. I have day one sorted - [Mt. Baldy 50k Course](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/baldy_50k/), higher elevation and gain than Leadville 50 apparently. Would be pretty hard in that respect so maybe more training benefit? I'd likely be self supported so it'd be all on me. Day 2 [Wheeler Peak Traverse](https://youtu.be/uLjrjtb1QUs), shorter route but some nice gains and views. Again alone. I'd have to sort out a third day but I'm sure I could find something. 

I think both trainings will be good mentally, just actually getting up and over some mountains. I can do hill repeats here all day but its obviously not the same. 

Curious if anyone has any experience either with Western States Training Camp or doing tour own adventure. Im sure im missing some big points too so please point out what you see.

Was supposed to be a nice 30 degree day but instead we were greeted with 13 degree temps, 2-5 degree wind chill, and snow. But, i dont account much for the weather since everyone has to deal with it. Doesn’t suck more for me than anyone else. 

What I didn’t account for was my lack of trail miles leading to the race. I’ve probably run 100 miles on trails since the start of December but nothing as technical as what I was gifted today. 

After 2 laps, my ankles, quads, and hamstrings had enough. I was slowed to a crawl. The way I felt, I knew if I started another 13 mile lap it would probably be an average of 20 mins or more per mile. With my wife manning my aid station in these crazy conditions, I just couldn’t do that to her and my body didn’t feel like it could take much more.

I graciously bowed out at the marathon mark.

It’s only divided into 4 laps: loop 1, aid station, loop 2, aid station, then stopped. 

It was tough. Before attempting 50 miles again, I will certainly train accordingly with lots more trail miles. 

Win for the day: my first loop was 10 minutes faster than 2020 when I only ran the half marathon. Relaxed effort in 2021 was faster than full effort 2020. Fitness is better. But not good enough.",1613256156

Typically when winter hits, I cut back on running and focus on snow sports but this year, I decided to go for a 100-miler in early May (it’ll be my second). So in my mileage build-up, I’m spending a lot of time running slowly in 10-20 degree F temps. 

Cold weather doesn’t bother me except I am thinking about food A LOT during my long runs, which I never do in warmer temps. Today I was dreaming about pancakes almost against my will. I fuel every 45 mins or so but it never feels like enough. And I am starving for the rest of the day, despite eating amply. I’ve actually gained a few pounds (but I usually do in winter anyway).

This hunger would make sense if I was shivering and freezing for 3 hours, but of course I warm up after 2 miles and feel quite comfortable for the majority of the time. Most of the articles I’ve read seem to confirm that if you’re warm, you’re not burning extra calories just by running in the cold.

ultrarunning,olivemoon777,Source of leg cramps?,"I ran in a 12 hour endurance race last weekend. Every lap was 2.5 miles. My goal was to hit at least 40 miles. While I’ve done two 50ks before, this was the longest distance I’ve ran. Every lap, I refilled my handheld with water and peed. The eighth lap (mile 20), my legs started cramping. This was, I though, because I peed away my electrolytes and needed sodium, so I ate potato chips. That got me through to the next lap pain free. Lap 11 (27.5), the cramps came back.

Needless to say, I made it to almost 30 miles then stopped. My ego was bruised, but now I just want to know what happened. Any insight is appreciated. I started weight training a few weeks ago and the elevation wasn’t terrible, so my legs were strong enough, or so I thought...",1613080041

ultrarunning,happybybonnie,What adventures are inspiring you in the absence of racing?,"Hi all...

Nothing new to see here - one year later and races that I had planned for April and May of 2020 were rolled over to 2021, and look like they might not/probably won't happen (Lake Sonoma 50, and Miwok) yet again. No final decisions have been made but based on the fact that these races are 2-3 months away or less, and have yet to receive their permits, it's not looking good.

ANYWAY. Here I am, fit enough to run 50-65 miles, and I'm thinking through other running adventures that could be fun that are not racing. Some ideas I came up with include:

\-the 2.5 bridge tour (running from SF, to Marin, to Richmond/East Bay, approx 45 mi since the Bay Bridge doesn't fully connect for pedestrians)

\-Rim to Rim to Rim, although this would require a bit of a road trip 

\-Running the Tahoe Rim Trail, probably in phases...idk if I could do a distance like that in one go hahah.

I know some folks are doing Backyard-style (4x4x4 or whatever...) but I don't think that's my thing. I guess my question is...what running adventures are inspiring you or keeping you motivated in the absence of racing? What trail running adventures keep you daydreaming between zoom calls? And for those of you in the West (especially near the Bay Area), what do you think are the top trail adventures to try while racing is still hit-or-miss?",1613077947

Every person who gets an automatically generated guGel promo code and has survived a 100k thinks they’re gods gift to the fitness community. Most of these people that keep showing up don’t do anything particularly noteworthy in the context of ultra running and the way they pedal for like and follows is just sad! I love ultrarunners, I love meeting people in trails and at races and learning about what fuels them and their background; mostly because you can relate to each other because there really is a special kind of crazy to people who willingly run for upwards of 10 hours of a time. There is something genuine about that, which drives me crazy with how staged these running influencers are. Like setting the phone down to make a video of you running by? Come on man.

I am planning on running 2 Spartan races in the beginning of June of this year in Fayetteville, NC. To those that are unfamiliar, Spartan races are basically trail races with a bunch of physical obstacles thrown in through out the race. 

The first race would be at 6:00AM and is going to be roughly 30ish miles (split in 2 15 mile ""laps"") and then at 2:30PM I would be running a half marathon roughly. This would be all on trails/unpaved course. Total would be any where from 40 to 45 miles. Elevation is unsure but I have race up ski slopes like Killington, VT before so that won't be an issue per say.

I have run one marathon before and there isn't anything wrong with walking/hiking for parts that I need to. I have long runs up to 10 miles this winter and don't know what I should aim for in terms of training with technically 2 races in one day. On top of that I am aiming to have hopefully a 1-2 hours between races to rest/eat. What would be important to do during that in-between time?",1613056208

Garmin has an entire page on how their Performance or Training metrics are derived: https://discover.garmin.com/en-US/performance-data/running/#physiological-measurements. 

For example it talks about how its recovery time takes into account stress and sleep data. 

I understand that Coros might be doing it in-house (instead of using FirstBeat like Garmin does) but I can’t seem to find much information on their metrics like how AI Trainer works, Training Load or how their anaerobic and aerobic TE values are derived. Are their Threshold HR and Pace values true?

In general, are the values given by Coros reliable? 

I understand that Coros is trying to appeal to serious athletes so it’s kinda weird that information like these are not readily available.

A lot of doctors and specialists I'm seeing don't have a running background. I am a firefighter so running is legitimately a part of my job, not just a hobby. 

So anyways, I have 4 bulging discs in my lumbar area (low back). Occasionally I get numbness (Sciatica) to my hands and feet. This occurred early last summer, but from Aug to Dec it was fine. I was training like I normally did. Then it started flaring up again in January to now. The weird thing is that I don't feel much of anything in my lower back. I get this weird aching feeling in the middle of my back. It's not really pain, but it makes me feel nauseous. I have notice that one of the things that triggers that feeling is running. Specifically long or fast runs. 

I took a couple weeks off and started slowly getting back into both weightlifting and running. Yesterday I went for a slow 4 mile run (in snow) and now I'm kinda getting that nauseous feeling again.

- fruit leathers / granola bars from Costco:  this is sufficient to get me through 2hrs at easy efforr but haven't tried anything longer on this fuel;

But we don’t all look like that! We come in all shapes and sizes, praise be, but I’m particularly looking for some wisdom about running far with big legs.

My experience so far is that my big legs seem to give me an advantage of steep technical descents, I’m stable and quick. But do they slow me down going uphill?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be running my first ""last man standing"" event at the beginning of april. Due to corona it's a virtual event so you do it at home and have to do 6.7 km (4.16 miles) every hour and you have to start at the beginning of every hour. Due to the curfew the event takes place from 5a.m. till 23.59.

Tips that were given on similar threads on this subreddit were:

- Don't overdo the carbs, also eat a lot of fats: almond/peanut butter, avocado, eggs....  
- Use something against chafing  
- Use tailwind as a drink  
- use enough variation for food and eat real food, no gels  
- start eating the last 10-15' of every lap  
- Never give up during your break at home whether or not you'll think you'll finish your next lap  
- pace: 45-55' per lap  
- during the resting phase: keep yourself busy, stretch, text some friends, eat, ...  
- Tell your crew what they need to prepare for the next time you finish your lap  
- 0.5 liter drinks/200-300 cals every hour

ultrarunning,DistantDaikon,Tip for the Mental Side of Things: Turn Off Auto-Lap,"I could be behind the ball on this one, and if so, I figured it could be good for people to give other mental tricks that help. My watch had an auto-lap function where it would beep every mile. I'm sure most people know what I am talking about. Never really thought much of it. However, I realized I was always keeping track of what mile I was at based on the beeps, even if I wasn't consciously tracking it. 

This would lead to me deciding after a certain amount of beeps (miles), the run was suddenly hard and I would mentally deteriorate. I recently turned off my auto-lap and just run by feel, and I found that I was much more in-tune with when I was genuinely getting fatigued vs. convincing myself I was fatigued and after X amount of miles.

If I want to know my current pace or anything, I simply hit the lap button, wait 20 seconds, check the pace, and keep moving. This has helped a ton mentally, as I no longer have a mental cue of when it is ""supposed"" to be hard. I just go only by how my legs feel. It has made long runs much more enjoyable. Just thought I would share, and if this is common knowledge, and if so, do you have any other mental tricks that are similar?",1612198245

ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,Who to believe on elevation: Suunto or Garmin,"I have a Garmin FR225 and a Suunto Traverse. The Garmin is five years old and I've only had the Suunto for a couple of months. Thie thing is, the Suunto is typically giving me accumulated ascent totals which are significantly higher than the Garmin- for example, on a 25km run on Saturday, 350m on the Garmin, 480m on the Suunto. Looking at the graphs the Suunto seems to be tracking more frequently, so I guess it could be just more precision on the little ups and down, but even on a km where both watches register 0m descent, the Suunto is giving a great ascent figure. I had previously assumed my Garmin to be generally correct as in a race I did it gave the exact same elevation number at the end of the race as the organizers had advertised. However, the Suunto is supposedly more of a mountain watch so should be more accurate on altitude/elevation?

What's the consensus on the accuracy of accumulated ascent readings?",1612173930
ultrarunning,Bradencoleman,100km Ultra Trail advice,"Hey there,

I’ve been given the opportunity to run the UTA100 in The Blue Mountains, NSW Australia.

I’m completely new to the idea of ultra running and only in the past 2 months or so started to take my running more seriously. My closest experience with any sort of endurance-like racing is Spartan races, which my longest one was about 24km’s. 

I believe my cardiovascular fitness would handle it relatively okay how it is as of right now, however what I’m not so confident about is the conditioning of my legs over that sort of distance/inclines and declines. I get very tight calves and shin pain currently which I tend to just toughen up and run through the discomfort. 

The UTA100 is in 4 months, and I’m wondering if anyone could provide some advice as to whether it is realistic for me to condition myself for this race in that timeframe? Any advice, direction to resources or criticism would be highly appreciated. Can anyone share there story on how prepared they were for their first 100k?

I’ll let it be known as well, I wouldn’t have any sort of support crew and I own no gear that fits the requirements of the race.

I work as a mountain guide and mountain rescue so I ski and (somewhat mildly) hike for work full time. It's not 40 hours of moving but it's enough my legs are tired at the end of the day. 

Couple that with running and the past couple weeks my legs have been super tired, all the time. So I took a full week off of running and built back up, but I'm at the same spot. Every run they are tired, every day at work they're tired. At night I have to sleep with compression shorts or I'll wake up from the aching.

I'm looking at signing up for a late April 50. Fairly flat rails-to-trails situation (the Frisco Highline, for those who may know it) I was set to run a similar one back in October that I had trained for thoroughly, but it cancelled due to COVID. My training dropped off significantly after that, so my longest run to date is a 50K back in August and my mpw is way down.

As mentioned, I've been humming along at a paltry 30mpw, a lot of which has been on the treadmill since December. I did a trail marathon last month that was pretty technical and hilly. It left me feeling wretchedly undertrained but since the course conditions were so different I don't want to read too much into it (but maybe I should?!).

So what do you think? Feasible? If so, I welcome any training suggestions. I figure getting myself up to 50mpw stat is essential but I'm not sure I'll have time to get the 60mpw block I have heard is pretty key as a minimum.

Time's not really a factor here. It's a 12-hour cutoff on a flat course and finishing before the cutoff would be my only real goal.

I earned the [first FKT doing the out-and-back on the Buffalo River Trail](https://www.reddit.com/r/trailrunning/comments/drm0nt/trip_report_out_back_on_the_buffalo_river_trail/), but I did it like a lazy fastpacker and slept twice (prerogative of the first to the set the record, I guess). I'm ready to go back to try to do it in one push.

I'd be thrilled if some of you were willing to look over my [training plan](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6xv89asxroqdoaw/2020-training.pdf?dl=0) and offer insight or critique.

**Course info:**

* Buffalo River Trail, out-and-back, northern Arkansas.
* Distance: 76 miles (122k)
* Vert: 16000 ft of gain/loss by route mapping (13000 by my previous GPS track)
* Surface: technical single track, rooty and rocky with occasional smooth hardpack.
* Main goal: &lt;23 hrs. Stretch goal: 20 hrs.
   * My moving-time was a little over 24 hours in 2019 (and my elapsed time was twice that). The new FKT-to-beat is 23h18m.

**Running history:**

* Started running August 2018. Lots of hiking before. 1300 miles in 2019 (including the FKT in October '19).
* 40-50mpw runner in 2019. 0-30mpw runner in 2020. 
* Running crashed in 2020. 750 miles.
* Some weekend adventure runs to kick off 2021 (12-20 miles, some off-trail).
* When I did the 2019 FKT, I completed it with an injury. I wasn't ready in 2019 but I did it anyway. I want to finish better this time and I feel that my base is a lot better even though in 2020 I ran a lot less.

**Plan overview:**

* Overall training goals are to improve my running base.
* 4-week cycles: base build, base build, vert build, recover.
* 150'/mile on base weeks, 220'+/mile on vert weeks, 100'/mile recovery weeks.
* Target: 60+mpw for 6-8 weeks prior to October, at least 6 weeks with 10,000'.
   * I would still feel I could complete the run if I have 8-12 weeks of 40+mpw with good training for vert and powerhiking.
* I'm really trying to train my base for sustained powerhiking up hills, so my primary target is vert based: at least one week with 14000'.

Now instead of doing most of my runs in zones 3 and 4 I'm pulling it wayyyy back and trying to stay at or under my first aerobic threshold. For lack of a better way to test, I just try to breath through my nose when I run and that puts me right at around 145-150 bpm. 

This all seems well and good but it feels kind of high. I just moved from sea level to Colorado so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with how altitude effects this? The examples in the book put the AeT for people just starting this kind of training way lower like 130 to 135. 

I'm at around 8 min/mile at my LT which is around 160 bpm I think. But now am struggling to do even 12 minute miles without my heart rate shooting up to 155, which is where breathing through my nose is no longer an option for me.

How do you run on sand? I have very little experience with beach running and it seems like a one off kind of surface. Is there a trick to knowing what kind of sand is good for running? I’ve seen some people wear baggies on their feet. Is that something necessary and why? What kind of workout would you do to prepare yourself to run on that kind of surface?

Also, what is impressive to me is his height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). I don't know if this is a disadvantage or to what extent but it is definitely the case that most long-distance and ultra runners are a fair bit shorter than that.

That week I naturally felt pretty creaky and slow at first, but was feeling a little better/faster with each run (still slower than pre-50miler pace), and I felt really good/fresh mentally too. 

Then I just felt like I hit a brick wall halfway through the next week. I was still running almost a couple minutes per mile behind my normal pace and felt like no progress was being made. In the next 6 weeks I only did a few 6-8 mile runs, each a week or more apart, still at that same slower pace. 

Anyways I’ve been getting back into very slowly the past few weeks (14,18, then 20 miles the past 3 weeks), 90% of that at a very easy pace. I still feel so much slower than I used to and feel like progress is so slow. I had been running for about a year prior to the event but always have been active in other sports (basketball mainly) so I feel like I have a decent base.

ultrarunning,SoupatBreakfast,Views on shoes for 45 mile - 60 mile trail ultra Altra Lone Peak / Hoka Speedgoats,"Apologies as this is probably yet another ""which shoe is best"" post but wondering on experiences with the following: I've got 2 races coming up this year (Covid pending of course), both are on the South West Coast path in the UK (one is 45 miles, other is 100 km). Ideally I'd break in my shoes over the next few months and be able to get used to one pair for both events. 

The routes have rocky/narrow trails and lots of undulation. Last summer I ran most of the route in training in my inov8 Parkclaws (stocked up on previous years' model as the fit is so good). These were actually pretty good for me despite their mixed use. These are close to dying and so I've tried both Inov8 Roclite 275s and Trailrocs - neither of which seem to fit and give me foot pain in my insteps no matter what. They are also quite narrow. I'm looking at Altra Lone Peaks (due to the wide toe box) or Hokas - probably Speedgoats in wide fit. 

Aware both are solid options but I can see cons in both unfortunately. I think need to swap brands now as the fit just isn't working any more with inov8 trail shoes. The potential issue with Altra is that the fit is a bit hit or miss (and tricky due to lack of open shops at the moment to try on) and with Hokas I've read that they are so high up that you can feel disconnected to the trail and perhaps not as nimble, plus the fact that grip isn't amazing on wet rocks. 

My other option is to just get some parkclaws again, but aware they aren't ideal for the job, plus from experience lack a lot of toe protection - I stubbed my toe on two consecutive days which hurt like hell.

ultrarunning,ENDKOG,Blood in Urine,"I have been doing the Badwater 267 through January.  Today I ran a pretty fast 6 miles in heat (82ish degrees in direct sun - I live in Puerto Rico).  I had a slightly achey feeling in my bladder area (front-center lower abdomen) that I have experienced before...and I stopped at home and I pee'd blood.  Not a little bit of blood...it was as it my urethra was the spout for a keg of dark red wine (think cabernet).    


Anyway, I have had this happen before (in September) following some hard consistent running.  The docs did some tests (having a camera inserted into your bladder via urethra is not a good time, in case you were wondering) and it turns out that I am anatomically normal (i.e. - no tumors or other weird and/or scary kidney/bladder things going on).  So my instinct is that this is a dehydration and possibly an electrolytes problem.  I sweat like and absolute beast, because it is hot during my runs and most of the runs are in direct sunlight.  I do drink 40 oz of huma electrolyte sport drink during my 10m daily run.  I havent been doing anything deliberate to replace electrolytes after the run...some days I eat more salty things than others...and I def drink ""a lot"" of water throughout the day...but just based on feel/thirst.  So my theory is that I have been at a net loss of fluid and electrolytes for days now and once that trend hits some critical point of dehydration...the next hard run is determined to cause some bloody violence inside my kidney/bladder system.  Here are my questions for you:  


1) Do you have another/better theory?  What is it?  
2) Have you struggled with running induced hematuria (peeing blood)?  What did you do to solve the issue?  
3) What do you think I should change up about hydration / electrolyte replacement either before/during/after my run

ultrarunning,Exotic_Ad_367,Advice for someone who wants to start?,"Hey all.

So I hate running. I run quite often, just a few kms but it's always easy for me (with regards to my endurance). The most I've ran is 21km, and I've done that 3 times. Mt endurance was absolutely, and usually I didn't have pains in my legs for more than a day after. 
At some point early last year I felt a niggle in my knee, and continued running anyway. I then had pain for months in both knee and ankle. One year later, the pain in my ankle is still present, but only when walking, not running, and not at all when I use my zero drop or barefoot shoes.

Anyway, just blabbering on here. Because of my ankle I feel almost like it'd be impossible for me to run a long distance without feeling it... I think it's some kind of trauma from being out of action for a couple months. I don't know how much of this ache in my ankle even really exists anymore, or what it is. 
My question to you guys, or questions... 

Have any of you also got some aches and pains or issues that could potentially stop you from running long distances, if you let them? I'm sure not everybody has a perfectly working body. If so, how have you overcome or do you overcome these hindrances? 

And do you have any advice to begin training for say, a 50km? Sure, I can probably already do 21km again without the training, but that's not the point. Where and how did you start? 

Finally, does anyone also do weight training? I'm about 4 months into trying to put on some muscle, and always hear that it's either running OR weightlifting. 

I really would like to achieve something incredible like you guys, but am just a bit hampered by fear and lack of knowledge at the moment. 

Really would appreciate advice! 
Merci 😊",1611140616

ultrarunning,bizbup,Wear Sunscreen,"[Wear sunscreen](https://gomilpitas.com/jokes/kurt-vonneguts-commencement-address/). No, [seriously](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kurt-vonnegut/), and I'm not kidding, [wear sunscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen).

Running last week was seriously interrupted by a dime/nickel sized removal of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from my upper forehead right by the usual hairline. I still have all my hair :). 

Cause--not wearing suncreen in my youth (aahhh, the 1970s, when smoking was unfortunately rampant and riding carefree in the back of a station en route to full fat ice cream was great fun). I previously had a BCC patch removed from my back neck/shoulder area right above the (running) shirt line. I've worn sunscreen for decades (and worn a hat for most of that time) but it takes decades to develop. Running all these miles, exposed to the sun, puts us at greater risk for sun damage and BCC.

Things happen as we get older, which includes various maladies. This is one of them but mostly easily preventable. [People of all colors can get BCC](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html)

I'll be fine as BCC is generally easily curable by the removal of the BCC area, but the discomfort and need to heal without pain, and without bleeding through the stitches to reduce scarring, meant complying with medical advice not to run last week and most of this week. BCC is the ""best version"" of skin cancer to get, but [there's worse like squamous cell and melanomas](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html).

The first BCC was found via a skin check by a dermatologist, which was generally recommended by my internist based on age. I had a list of areas of concern I brought to the doctor. Each of those weren't in fact anything. But the dermatologist said this patch right here on your neck/back, that's where I’m concerned. I said that's nothing, just some redness and I probably just irritated my skin with something. Obviously I was wrong and the doctor was correct--it was BCC. 
I would have NEVER thought to go to the doctor if I had saw that red patch on me or anyone else. Get regular skin checks.
The second one was noticeably strange, but then I didn't go to the dermatologist because of Covid. Then I did and it was BCC as I suspected.

So wear sunscreen now to avoid sun damage and making this post yourself decades from now. And, for long runs, I generally wear what I call a [French Foreign Legion hat](https://www.runningwarehouse.com/Headsweats_Protech_Hat/descpage-HPH.html) that you can get from anywhere (the link is just one example) because your neck and shoulders are also exposed.

Plus, you'll look fabulous from the absence of sun damage (though despite my middle aged but youthful looking appearance from decades of wearing sunscreen, I still got BCC).",1611011492

My question is about what my food/energy intake should be on my long Z2 runs.

I have a 100km race coming up in July in the UK, so close to 24 weeks out. I don’t have much ultra experience, only running a 47.5km race last October. Since then, I’ve been running 80-85km weekly over 5 days for roughly 2.5 months, the same mileage as my peak in 2020. It’s mostly been easy miles (incl. long runs) with one day of threshold per week. As I’ve just been building, I’m currently running to time rather than distance. The past couple of weeks I’ve introduced 12x ~1 minute hill reps in between easy miles during one of my weekly runs.

Looking towards the race, can anybody offer advice about how to structure training? Some general points I’d appreciate feedback on:

- I’m definitely planning to increase the long run mileage more specifically. I’m targeting a 55k race some 4/5 weeks prior that’ll probably serve as my peak week, and will increase/decrease long runs around this as appropriate.

- I currently run the day after my long run, and will probably increase the mileage here over time 

- I think I’d like to incorporate speed work, any tips on how and when? E.g. 1km/1mi repeats early in the plan or later?

- Following that, should I periodise this training at all? I think any more than 2 workouts per week is too much, so should I be thinking hill reps + threshold for 4 weeks, followed by intervals + threshold for 4 weeks, or maybe longer hill reps + threshold, etc

- Lastly, any other ideas for specific workouts and when to incorporate? I’m conscious that it’s hard to do any training at “race pace”. I like the idea of progression runs, for example, are these best used infrequently and early? Or closer to the race?",1610745566

ultrarunning,bama-runner,SCAR Preparation / 100 with little support,"Bit of background coming, with a TL;DR at the end. In the spring of 2019, I did the SCAR with a group of friends (SCAR is a backronym for Smoky Challenge Adventure Run, all of the AT in the Smokies). All in all, I/we learned a lot from the run that I hope to apply when I go back for round 2, which will hopefully happen in a few months. When we go back for round 2, however, we're adding an extra 30 miles at the end of the SCAR. On the plus side, we're getting some support at mile \~30, \~70 &amp; \~85 (if you're familiar with the course, that's Newfound Gap, Fontana Dam &amp; Stecoah Gap). For folks who've done 100-mile distances with little or no support, what's your strategy? I'll share some details on gear &amp; the course last time so you have a sense of where I'm coming from. 

We ran it from North to south, and we plan to do north-south again this round. We'd done the math on an anticipated pace matching a 24-hour finish, and we realized shortly after leaving Davenport Gap about 1:00p that was going to be a struggle. There was ice &amp; snow on the trail for the entirety of the first 30 miles, all the way to Newfound Gap, plus ice all the way up Clingman's Dome. We were moving about 20-minute miles in the snow during the day, and did OK until the sun went down. After dark, the temp dropped below freezing, and running became much more difficult, if not impossible. We slogged our way into Newfound Gap around 2:00a, and over Clingman's about 4:00am, at \~30 degrees F &amp; 30 MPH gusts of wind. Not fun. 

Terrain, trail condition, &amp; weather improved south of Clingman's Dome, and we made pretty good time while moving during the day. Water, however, slowed us down. We had 3 hand pump filters between the 7 of us, and filling up water bladders took \~an hour. Needless to say, we burned *a lot* of time filling up bottles. We eventually rolled into Fontana Dam about 9:00p that night, all but out of water and very tired.

Knowing all of that, I have a few things that I, plus the group, will do different. 

* Trade out  the hand pump for a Sawyer inline filter. I've been using the one I'll take for \~a year with no issues. Love it.
* Bring a better first-aid &amp; hygiene kit. No details needed. I learned a lesson. 
* Prep for a slow pace, and plan the early part of the run around when we want to summit Clingman's. For the full course, we're estimating \~40 hours.
* Bring lots of options for clothes. This didn't really bite me last run &amp; I'll basically recreate my kit from last run for this round.
* Carry fewer calories for the SCAR portion (picking up more at Fontana, or mile 72). I carried 10-12K calories with me last run for the 72 miles, and I had 2K+ in my bag when finished. Felt like wasted space.

What am I missing? For folks who've done (mostly or fully) unsupported ultras, lend me your wisdom! If you've done the SCAR specifically, any tactical guidance would be appreciated.

TL;DR - In a few months, I'm heading out with a group of friends to run the 72 miles of the AT in the Smokies, plus \~30 more to make a 102-miler adventure run. For folks who've run 100-milers with little support, what suggestions do you have? Gear, water sourcing, nutrition, pain management...? I'm confident in my training plan, but if you have a silver bullet to share, please don't hold it back!

ultrarunning,Full-Option6556,"Help with ""Knee"" Injury","Hello All,

I was wondering if I could poll the crowd here. I’ve had a “knee” issue off and on for the last 5 years. I’m a avid runner and my typical week is anywhere from 40-70 miles (although I’ve taken off the last few weeks in hopes to get this knee problem under control). I’ve run 9 marathons and my most recent run was a 50 mile ultra in October 2019. I was training for a 100 mile ultra when covid happened and have just been running for mental health lately with no race on the calendar.

I’ve struggled with patellofemoral pain syndrome for about the same period of time as my knee injury. With the PFPS, I can generally get it under control by doing some step ups, reverse lunges, clamshells, etc. If I stay focused on that regimen and follow it for several weeks with reduced mileage, the PFPS will be almost non-existent. The PFPS has never stopped me from running but always painful when going downstairs and issues like that. Unfortunately, the PFPS always seems to come back if I don’t do my exercises 4-5 times per week.

The other issue is this knee problem. It’s not exactly my knee but it is right on the side of it. I am posting two pictures where I am pointing to the irritation. This problem is more nagging than the PFPS because I don’t even know what the issue is. I’ve seen a couple PTs but no one has really been able to help me. The best way I can describe it is that it is a dull pain. I can through it and it has never been completely debilitating, but I am always worried it is going to get worse, which keeps me from training hard when this issue pops up.

I’ve noticed this knee pain can get really bad if I am squatting a lot (just body weight). Even if I am squatting down to help my 2 year old son with something for a couple minutes that can trigger it. And once it has been triggered, I have no idea how to make it go away. The other thing that irritates it is stretching my hamstring (as you’ll see in the picture). When this is flared up, the entire side of the knee can sometimes feel irritated, but it always is tender where I am touching. I’ve also noticed that it can be irritated when I am driving if my leg is pushed out towards the gas for a long time. It also can bother me if I set at my desk for a significant period of time.

Again, it is not a completely debilitating thing, but I have no idea what it is or how to treat it. Since 2016, I’ve had some significant periods of time where it was not bothering me. Basically, it did not bother me at all in 2019 while I was training for the 50 mile ultra.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what this could be and how I can go about treating it? Is this somehow related to the PFPS? If so, should the exercises for the PFPS address this issue? I’ll admit, I’m not a big fan of going to PTs as the ones I’ve seen all just want to tell me to run less. Thank you.

Finally, Al Arnold accomplished the first known solo trek in 1977 of 84 hours and sobbed with joy on the summit. These were the roots of the future Badwater Ultramarathon.

I’ve got plenty of time to experiment with different stuff on long runs so I’m open to any suggestions. Yesterday’s long run was my longest so far at 30km// 18.64 miles and 40 miles (~65km) for the week. I ran at 8:10 per mile pace so it was a 2 and a half hour run. The reason I’m considering using a vest rather than a handheld bottle is because over the course of that time, my arm started to get pretty tired from holding the water bottle. At around 2 hours, I had to switch arms but it was still pretty annoying and distracting. I’m wondering if any negatives of using a hydration vest would be more of an inconvenience or less of an inconvenience than my arm being annoyingly tired (which is the only downside I’ve ever experienced with a handheld water bottle). Feel free to suggest a completely different option or call me out for having weak arms or something- idc. Around what distance/ time do you usually opt for a vest rather than a handheld?

I'm also going to be more tired than usual. What should I do to mitigate?

In more detail: I'm 45m, looking to do my first mountain marathon/50k this spring. I've been building volume steadily since May, up to 250km/month. Usually doing a long run on Sundays (up to 32km), 15-18 on Saturdays, and three or four more runs of between 5-8km during the week.

But now I am going to be busy and physically exhausted at the weekends. The unprecedented snowfall we just had in Central Spain has done massive damage. I am going to have to cut down, cut up and burn off maybe 15-20 trees. Some of them are quite tricky, some of them are pretty big, most are on a hillside. I can't afford to get a company in to do it. My wife and some friends will help, sometimes, but I reckon it's basically going to mean at least 8-10 hours of hard physical work every weekend until March, plus the planning, buying equipment, fuel etc.

Don't want to go on for too long. Has anyone dealt with having to cut down training hours? Or any tips for motivating myself to get out of bed and run on a weekend morning knowing that I have to then spend several hours as a lumberjack?",1610284277

ultrarunning,letcha,"My first solo ultra, from Point Reyes to San Francisco","Hey all, I shared this in /r/norcalhiking and they suggested that some of y'all might be interested as well.

I ran my first solo ultra (50k) last weekend, from Point Reyes (Bolinas Ridge Trailhead) to San Francisco (via Golden Gate Bridge).

It was an incredible experience. Physically, it was the hardest route I've ever done, but the views were breathtaking the entire way and I was able to keep the negative self-talk at bay for a fairly smooth run overall. I've absolutely had a more difficult time finishing flat marathon courses in the past.

[I wrote about my experience here](https://johnvantine.com/solo-50k-when-2020-gives-you-lemons-run-an-ultramarathon/), but some quick highlights from the day:

The weather was beautiful. A little mud on the trail from recent rain left the ground with that perfect ""bounce"". It was cool in the shade and hot in the sun... and the trail had a great mix of both, with dense forest opening up to epic views of coastline.

I almost ran into a bobcat. Literally. I was looking down at my phone to queue up a song, and when I looked up he was right in front of me. I shouted a lot and waved my arms around like a lunatic to get him off the trail. If that's not crazy enough, this is my second bobcat trail sighting in this month!

The mental games were minimal. This stretch of trail is so awe-inspiringly beautiful that I had sufficient distraction from the temporary pain. I was so into the music and my surroundings that I was just loving the hell out of the experience.

Having my family waiting for me at a few stops along the way broke the run nicely, and gave me something to keep pushing for. They met me at miles 11 and 22 for water/fuel/inspiration.

They were also waiting for me at the north side of the Golden Gate, and my daughter rollerbladed across the bridge with me during an epic sunset. The timing was perfect.

All in all this was an epic running experience. 2020 has been all about finding that silver lining, and this race was one hell of a consolation prize!

ultrarunning,Astonish_Mint,Looking for Advice . First 80+ Miler.,"I have been looking at a loop route that goes around my city for at least 6 months.

At first I thought I created it then found out it already existed.

It is about 80-90 miles (I have a GPS track but it includes out and backs to do it in 8 day hikes at 100 miles).

Anyway I had been training to do this as an Ultra and started running 30 miles a week and added more till after 7 weeks I was doing 50 miles a week. It was too much and I got shingles. 

Its been almost 2 months now and I feel much better but I have a sore throat.

I want to get into FKT's. I have set one that I am very proud of but it is more of an OKT and only really impressive because most of the trail is unmarked and extremely steep at times. (110 miles  hours with 38,800 feet elevation gain in under 54 hours / *I brought a tent and slept 5 hours in the middle*). 

I really want to do this tomorrow but the most I have ran with out sleeping is only 65 miles on the above mentioned ""FKT"".

I come from a hiking background so I am use to hiking 30 miles a day consistently with 10,000 cumulative thru-hiking trail miles since 2012.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Anyway, what I wanted to ask is should I train more?

What training should I do? I am pretty slow but I can go for a long distance.

I would like to work on speed.

Would running on a track be helpful?

Any other advice would be really helpful, I don't have any running friends so I don't know where else to ask for advice.

I would like to run Ultras in the future but I have only run a few 5k races when I was in High School.

I know that I should rest but I really want to do this and the timing is good (\~3 day weekend \~Big moon \~only down to 15 degrees at night with mild wind) .

Also I can bail at any point and take a taxi home as it is a loop around my city but I don't think I would bail because I am really stubborn.",1609376007

ultrarunning,yoozernamed,Looking for beta testers for recovery/wellness app (+story),"Hey team, fresh off the heels of signing up for my first race for 2021 (anyone else here running Marji Gesick 100 with me??) I'm feeling excited and nervous to really ramp up training. 

I normally do a good job at putting my head down and suffering through training/racing, and not great at all of the other things like rolling/recovery/sleep. I am fortunate to have a few friends that are coaches &amp; physios and give me different series that I can do before &amp; after for range of motion work but normally need to have videos or some recording to remember all of the moves and in what sequence. 

I've decided to take my background in tech startups and build an app for myself (and maybe others) to guide users along a visual movement program that is displayed on their mobile phone focused on health range of motion and restorative poses that adapts to their needs. Think of a mix between stretching, RoM work, and bodyweight work. A key component of this will also be that the adaptation will include the ability to enter in how much time you have to commit to this activity and it will build the program to fit that time window. 

How the adaptation part works is a bit more complicated than I want to get right now, but I will say I'm pulling from my network of top notch coaches (working with average joes to pros) and some seriously intelligent fellow nerds in the tech world to produce something fun that should have some real power to it when finished. Of course I have loads of ideas on what would be fun long term, but baby steps.

**If anyone would like to sign up to be a beta tester I would sincerely appreciate the feedback and participation. Please DM me and I will get you on a list for the first release.** 

I love this community and cannot think of a better group to get input from. This is not my startup so I'm not married to the idea, rather want to test my hypothesis across a few groups. This is actually more intended for the folks trying to get off of the couch to build consistent fitness into their lives but I'm going to selfishly use the time to test the tool for my own needs and thought maybe y'all would enjoy too. Any comments, questions, input welcome.

At 37 years now, my left knee not only has pain during run but has a dull ache constantly. I used the pandemic time to stop running to see if it’d resolve but when I started back up a couple months ago, it’s just been worse.

Went to PCP to have it looked at, and she diagnosed as osgood from childhood. Had X-ray done to confirm nothing structural, and everything was clear.

ultrarunning,AHRocks187,Back to back long runs - how often and how long?,"Hey all,

Been reading this subreddit for several months but glad to finally be making my first post!
I'm currently 3 months into a 9 month training plan for my first 100 mile ultra - the South Downs Way 100 in June. I wrote the plan myself largely based on one I saw online. In summary it's split largely into 4 week cycles, with 3 week training blocks and then a recovery week. In weeks 1 and 3 of each block I do back to back long runs on the weekend - for example last week I did 24 miles on Friday and 12 miles on Saturday. I think I have a couple of weekends around 25/20 by the end, and I'm really enjoying these as a chance to practice race strategy. 

In contrast, I was lucky enough to receive a copy of Relentless Forward Progress for Christmas. I was very excited about it given how much I've seen it mentioned, but was surprised to see that in the 100 mile training plans, there aren't many true b2b long runs, especially on the 50 mile per week plan.

I'm going to stick with my current plan for now as it's working for me and I've mentally committed to it, but was curious to hear what your strategy of b2b runs is when training for long events?

Happy running!!",1609280049

ultrarunning,Li54,Nasal breathing?,"I listened to a podcast yesterday that made some fairly convincing arguments for nose breathing during exercise. Specifically

 * You get 20% more oxygen with a nose breath than a mouth breath
 * The slower rate of respiration allows more oxygen to get into the bloodstream / muscles 
 * You release more nitric oxide, which means muscles can get more oxygen, and you become less fatigued as a result (and also recover faster)

I’m suspicious, because I very rarely have run with nose breathing (usually only downhills and going slow / when I’m feeling good, and it’s not intentional). I can’t imagine doing interval training with nose breathing, but there are plenty of articles that advocate for it. 

Interested in everyone’s thoughts.

Currently, my training and form has been in a downward spiral. I just dodged a Achilles tendinitis bullet thankfully but the PT does not believe the injury was local. She seemed fairly concerned about overall stability and frankly was surprised that I was able to run with my current movement pattern. She did say that slow jogs were permissible and that cycling, skiing, strength training without compound movements, or walking were all preferable.

I do feel that taking a break for at least a few weeks to reset my movement patterns would be very beneficial. The only other extended break I have taken was following a stress fracture. In that case, it was not much of a choice to press pause. Currently, I am struggling to take a break but running feels terrible.

ultrarunning,no_bad_pizza,Suunto 9 Baro vs Coros Apex,"

Hey everyone, I need a new GPS watch and I'm having a hard time picking one between the 9 Baro and the Coros Apex. I currently have an Ambit 3 Peak and I have nothing bad to say against it, but I'm looking into signin up for trail races in the 100-125 km range next year and i'm pretty sure battery life will be an issue for those with my current watch.

Aside from better battery life, and don't really need any new features that the Ambit 3 Peak doesn't have. I can get the 9 Baro for a cheaper price than the Coros because of the loyalty offer for Suunto users, but I keep reading negative posts and reviews about the watch that seems to indicate that it's not as reliable as the 3 Peak.

My main hesitation about the Coros Apex is that according to the specs of the watch, it's ""coldest working temperature"" is -10 Celcius/ 14F. I live In Canada and I run all year long, so that would obviously be an issue in the winter.

Any tip or comment about either watch would be helpful.

ultrarunning,TheOnlyCaveat,Should I test my 100k pace on a 50k training run? And when?,"Background: I have one ultra under my belt (and a handful of marathons). I did Lake Sonoma 50 miler in April 2019. Next year they are adding a 100k distance which I am all in for. For the 50, I didn’t have much of a time goal and I went way slower than I was capable of. I ran 10:26 but could have broken 10 no problem. 

For this race, I’d like to see what I can do as far as pushing for a time. I’m early in training but I’d like to ideally pull in under 12 hours, which is 1:30 min/mile faster than the 50 I ran. 

My question is, should I test/practice that pace on a long training run? Like a 30 miler? If so, at what point in training? 4 weeks out? 3?

I feel like there’s probably a huge benefit to putting in a long run at your desired race pace when you are a bit worn down (like near the end of a training cycle). Is this a good idea or is that pushing too hard and risking injury?

ultrarunning,SkiingOnFIRE,Training with cycling?,"I ran a 50k last June with zero “training” and had a relatively easy time (ie no injuries, decent time, etc) but definitely was not as polished as it would have been as I decided to do it two days in advance and it was my first time at a distance over ~15mi. At that point I was trail running 10-20 MPW with zero back to back long runs or any type of structured training... it was all for fun. I also climb, cycle and ski tour in the few months leading up to it which is the reason why I wasn’t dedicating my self to running but I was still in decent shape.

I’d like to do a 50 miler this summer and want to implement structured training and give it a solid go after learning a few things last year. Unfortunately if I truly want to give it my best go I’d have to seriously put cycling and climbing on the back burner which is the basis of my question. I’m fine with leaving some potential on the table as long as I’m can keep up with cycling too. Climbing I’m less worried about.

Has anyone successfully (I understand this is subjective) prepared for a 50mi+ while balancing other activities? I’m looking at a route with ~10-15k of vert. Let me hear your thoughts! Thanks!",1608745583
ultrarunning,LaszloYtal,Running-around-the-world questions,"Hey everyone,  


I have some questions about run-around-the-world attempts. Guiness World Book of Records has not gotten back to me since months, so thought I'd give it a go here:  


a/ Ultimately, after quarantine lifts, I want to attempt to run a self-supported around-the-world-record in 300 days with a backpack (this means I'd be running 82 km per day). I've done months of research but have not found much official information on who the current record holder is? Is Kevin Carr's feat doing it in 621 days correct?

aII/ Which distance is considered an around-the-world-run? It seems to be somewhere along the lines of 18,000 miles / 26,000 km?  


b/ Is the difference in ""unsupported"" and ""self-supported"" relevant when running around the world? As I understand it, unsupported means you take all the food you'll need with you at the start. But this seems quite impossible when you're on the road for 300 days? xD It seems therefore sad that around-the-world-runners need to call themselves ""self-supported"", while you're basically going on a 300 day road race? It seems to me these distinctions are not really applicable outside the realm of competition?   


c/ Another thing is I want to try to do it without sponsors. The idea is to go on smaller running expeditions (minimum 60-80 km per day, minimum 1000 km per expedition) and make them visible in my YouTube vlog. Once I reach the point of sufficient monetization with YouTube, that'll be the point to execute my world run. So my last question is, did anyone ever do something similar without sponsors?  


d/ AFAIK I've seen most self-supported around-the-world-runners use carts to carry their gear around, has anyone ever tried it with a backpack?   


Thank you for reading,

I am signed up for the Bryce 100 in late May but I live on the coast of Georgia. There are zero hills where I live, and the highest point is 26ft above sea level. I’m certainly not expecting to “race” this event, but I would like to survive and ideally even finish. I have previously done a 50 miler at 4500’ and didn’t feel any altitude at all. I realize that’s substantially different than 7500’ - 9500’, just offering precious experience. Im specifically looking for:
A. Any training tips to prepare without actually traveling to mountains (not an option before the race)
B. Timing of arrival before the race. I’ve heard that one month is ideal, but I’m a 44 yr old family man and business owner, not an option. I could feasibly pull off a week before the event. Is that worth it? Or am I better off showing up the night before and minimizing time at altitude.

ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,Training for the downhills,"Two days after my second ever 30km run (first was two weeks ago) I went out thinking I'd do a recovery run, up and down my local hills, maybe 180-200m total climb. Nope! I ended up doing maybe 7km but all walking, as I was still very much feeling Sunday's run in my legs,  especially going downhill. So what to do to work on downhill endurance? I can only really get out to actual mountains maybe once a fortnight.

For context: 45M, 180cm, 92kg approx. Doing about 220km per month, mostly slow and easy with some tempo runs. Used to run 10ks and HMs, but I've got into the idea of running mountain ultras and have been training with that in mind since May. 

My local runs are quite hilly, where in a 10km run I'm probably doing 230+ vertical. I have built my long run up to 30k, and have done two at that distance. The first, two weeks ago was one-way, uphill, but mostly quite gentle slopes for a total of about 500m vert. This Sunday I did a loop that included two 300+ metre climbs, and of course their descents. I feel like the downhills were harder on my legs than the distance per se.

I'm training because I love being out in the hills all day and want to be able to run all over the mountains of Spain. I want to do an organised event this year if they are back to normal. Here the ranges generally go from around marathon distance, to around 60k, to around 80k, but with fairly serious uphills involved. The marathon-ish events I'm looking at have 2000-2700m vertical gain.",1608647215

The Salomon Sense Ride sometimes come up as a suggested shoes for forest roads (as compared to the Speedcross that I definitely do not need). Altra Escalante is mentioned as a road shoe that can be good on dirt roads, but most Reddit users say it is only good for shorter distances. Brooks Caldera is one option since it has a 4mm drop, but it has a lot of cushion. Brooks Cascadia has too much drop for me.

New to running and almost new to sports, I became 50 in July this year and last serious sports were in school, nearly 35 years ago. I started running, after I lost 30 kg of weight since Nov. 2019, end of Feb. 2020 and running caught me 150%!

Started slow, running a few 100m, walked, running again and so on. Bit very fast I loved running for longer distances and I run my first HM end of May, 2:16:xx.

I've run a few half marathons and have always loved the idea of an ultra. I'm planning on running a 50km by the end of 2021 and a 100km by the end of 2022. Since March this year I've started taking training seriously with the goal of and building mileage really slowly with mainly low heart rate training. 

I've followed the general rule of building for 3 weeks and cut back on the 4th week. However, I get to 30km per week and I'm fine but whenever I start increasing beyond that I start getting minor niggles here and there... With a history of injuries I've learnt it's always best to deal with them sooner rather than later and truly believe the saying ""it's better to take a week off now than a month or more later on"". 

After every run I have a stretching routine which takes about 10-15min to get through and I've started incorporating some strength training but don't really know what I'm doing...

I guess my questions are, what can I do to help me increase my mileage with minimal injuries? Should I be stretching more/less? What stretches should I be doing? Should I do more or less strength and what should I be doing? Should I be cross training?

ultrarunning,Freeasabird01,What do long runs look like during taper?,"I have a [virtual 100](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=74690) I was planning on doing 12/19. I did what was planned to be my last long run three weeks out, doing a 25/16 double on 11/27 and 11/28.

But now due to family commitments I need to move the event to 12/30. This will put me at nearly 5 weeks between last long run and race. Would you keep up a shortened long run to some degree or just coast for these extra few weeks?",1607530257
ultrarunning,CanidPsychopomp,"How long can my long run safely be, and how often?","45yo male. 182cm, 93kg. Running for several years but with injury and weight gain interruptions. Back to it seriously over the last 18 months, and really seriously since May. My goal is to do a 45-50k, 2000m+ in the next 12 months, either an organised event or self-supported.


My long runs are getting longer. I did 32k, 600m vert on Sunday, which is a new distance PR. I was tired at the end, but two days later I'm already thinking about doing it again. I went with a friend who'd also never done that distance, on a beautiful, varied route. We followed advice to take it really easy, took walk breaks, refueled and rehydrated and finished in four hours. 

I loved it. I think I could have gone both faster and further. I have a solid base of ten or twelve 20-26k runs over the previous five months, and I think the step up to 30k plus is fine. I'd like to go up to 35k and then marathon distance over the next couple or three months if possible.

However I have often seen advice NOT to run more than 2.5-3.5 hours very often. What does the hivemind think? stick to a time maximum and try to get faster? Cut out the walk breaks? Maximum once a month or less frequent for longer distances? Do the walk breaks 'allow' me to stay out longer at less injury risk? What about a three hour run, a long food and rest break, and a run back? I'm hungry to run more, I love being out in the hills, but also wary of injury.

ultrarunning,RedManRunner96,Winter 50miler tips?,"Is there any extra essentials that y’all feel the need to add into winter ultramarathon drop bags/hydration packs? I have all of my essentials so far: 
 - Socks x 3 + the pair I will start in
 - head lamp 
 - Vaseline for the feet if they get wet for blistering 
 - gloves 
 - gels/energy bars
 - ibuprofen/electrolyte tablets

I am not bringing any extra shoes as my other pair of trail shoes is too narrow for my toes and will just negatively affect me. As for my beginning gear and clothing, I will be wearing a base layer thermal compression long sleeve, a thermal long sleeve over it, and then I will have a rain shell/ wind shell (Montbell Versalite) over it to protect me from th elements. Other than that, I’m just going to have a pair of gloves, shorts (maybe some compression pants underneath), and a hat + buff combo that will cove my ears. 

Thanks in advance for any tips!",1607476908

ultrarunning,bottomfishbananas,Issues with front of ankle after first ultra,"Hi!

I completed my first Ultra last Tuesday. 40 miles self supported and raised a decent amount for charity. It was hard as I expected but I've put in 1300 miles of training this year so I felt ready for it. It went well and I stuck to my plan and was sensible with pace etc.

The day after I felt pretty good. Even managed to get out and do 3 miles to get my legs moving but I haven't run since due to my ankle.

The only issue I have is the front of my right ankle. If you were to go from each ankle bone and draw a line to the front of my foot then that's where the issue is. Kinda toward to the bottom of my shin as oppose to on my actual foot. It got pretty uncomfortable in the last couple of miles of the run and then it was pretty sensitive on the 3 miles the day later.

I can't even get to see a physio currently as they're all booked up until next year but I want to get out training again. For now I'm stuck resting it but I'm wondering if anyone has had similar issues and could shed some light on it? I'd rather be sensible and let it heal instead of going out too early and causing myself further issues.  


To clarify. It's not on the top of my foot. I've seen a lot of things about laces being too tight but it's not the same issue. If I go out walking then it just feels a bit tired after a while. Like a dull ache more than anything and it gets a little uncomfortable at night when I'm trying to get to sleep.",1607370624

ultrarunning,havealooksee,Managing Joint Aches During Race,"As my fitness has improved over the years, muscle pain and exhaustion have become less and less of an issue during ultras. Unfortunately, that has left me now very aware of my joint aches, primarily knees but also ankles. The knees usually start aching after 50k or so, so during a 100 that's a long time to suffer!

Does anyone have any hot tips on managing those aches during long ultras? I hate feeling like these low level aches are the thing that's slowing me down. 

There are three things I've found that help me some, but all have down sides. 

1. Walk - this obviously slows me down
2. Run faster - not sustainable. 
3. Poppin IB's - Liver damage.",1607352323

Legs and feet were suffering pretty badly during. Legs are a 7-8 out of 10 today. Quads mostly. Hammies a bit. Is this just how it will always be or have you all seen you post race pain diminish with more races?  

Also wondering if it is a deficiency in training. With gyms closed I know my strength training suffered. No heavy squats or deadlifts. Mainly body or light weight.  Would this help?

ultrarunning,Tohnmeister,Staying in shape after achieving a goal,"In February 2021 I'm attempting my first 80 km. There's lots of information about getting there. There are many beginner training plans. But what I find lacking is information about how to, after running the distance you're training for, staying in shape.

After running the 80 km, I want to stay in shape, so that occasionally I could run another ultra when I feel like it. I'd like to regularly run more than 40 km, but not be in this constant mode of training for a specific ultra.

How do others do this? Is there some information available for how to stay in shape, but specifically for when running very long distances?",1607337255
ultrarunning,Jack7062,Hydration vest freezing against chest,"Hi all,

I completed a training marathon yesterday using a Salomon Active Skin 8 hydration vest. Overall it was a fun workout, but I was concerned that the soft flasks felt like they were freezing through my baselayer and against my chest. The temperature hovered at just below freezing most of the way,  but I'd hoped the vest's material would have prevented any discomfort. By the end of the run I had a couple of red marks on my chest where the cold had penetrated my jersey.

Has anyone got any novel solutions to this problem? Wondering whether the soft flasks could be wrapped in a thin material or gauze for even a little extra protection. Alternatively, whether dispensing with the soft flasks and going for a bladder might be the best move.

Any pointers appreciated! Jack",1607337153

(d) ideally a long battery life, given my runs are typically 10 hours long (although 30 min would be fine)  


Have any other ultra-runners here got experience with filming their runs with drones? I'd love to connect over this. I often go for 60-80km runs crossing mountains and therefore interested to be able to share the journey more.

This was supposed to be week 1, but I had a hard time sticking to it. Mileage is just so low compared to what I normally do. Not sure if I should jump in the plan based on my current mileage? Any additional advice appreciated (see previous post for running history).

But the fun update - I ran a half trail marathon this weekend. Its a local race, I was waitlisted, and just decided to go for it. My pervious best on a trail with similar elevation was 2:27, so I made my goal 2:15. I ended up finishing at 2:09 (13.56 miles because trail race, duh!). I was pretty pumped,  this was the first time I ran anything with a time goal - usually I'm racing a new distance just to see if I can finish. 

The plan above calls for a half marathon in February. I have a local race that's on that weekend. 3 hours, on a 4.4 mile trail loop. I'm going to try and knock out three loops before the last hour (have to start last loop by that time) and see if I can bag 4 laps.

ultrarunning,Dangerous_Dichotomy,Nutrition after 30 miles,"Has anybody else experienced this lack of appetite after 25-30 miles in your train up or on race day? How did you get through that sensation to keep getting enough calories for the remainder of the race/run? 

I am running my first 50 mile ultra on December 26th and peaked today with a 30 miler (longest I’ve ever ran). I’m not sure if this is the right answer, I was just going off some articles I’d read. I should be able to taper/recover properly over the next 3 weeks. 

I structured today’s run as a 7.5 out and back (15 total), twice. That way I could refill at my house before heading back out. 

Throughout the run I would eat half of a fuel source package (honey stinger waffle or chew, Gu, clif block chews) every 15 min, giving me about 120-150 calories every 30 minutes. At the halfway point, I ate a Complete Cookie and drank 16 oz. of drip drop ORS mix before heading back out for second leg. Admittedly, I should’ve eaten a more “real” food at the half way point. This worked pretty well and I felt pretty good (food intake-wise) until about 28 miles. I hit a point where it seemed like my body wouldn’t let me actually swallow any food/fuel. I’ve read about this happening to others. 

My worry is the intake of enough calories to get my through the extra 20 miles I’ll be running on race day.",1607290447

Should I abandoned that much of climbing and focus solely on longer, easy running? Is 100 km/w enough or should I run more?

About my finishing time, I don't know what should I expect.

I will be cutting as much sugar and processed food out of my diet as possible. This will be tough, I crave sugar a lot. Got a pair of running shoes and headed out this morning for a short run. Felt pretty decent. Heart started pounding after 1.5 miles, but finished without my feet being too sore. Stretched before and after. Going to head to target today and get some better running clothes. It was really cold this morning. Here we go!

**Backstory:** During COVID I became very sedentary. I didn't exercise much and ate a lot of sugar. I gained 25 pounds (5'10"" 190 lbs.) and started feeling very fatigued all the time. I decided it was time to make a change. Gaming is my main hobby. I used to backpack frequently, but with life and work I have been busier and it has been harder. I have never been a runner and decided to take up running as a new hobby. I want to make a change in my life by eating better, exercising more and trying feel better physically and mentally.

Originally I'm training for trail races, but my first race is in the May, still is long time until that 60k race.

Currently good part of my running is on the pavement, and the track nearby is also asphalted. To be honest, 12h is more appealing to me and I'm not worried about my fitness (at least to finish it), just about eventual injury from that repetitive type of track running, even with the changes of direction. 

As someone who once (two years ago) sustained ITB injury and was 11 months out, I would lie when I'd say that I'm not concerned about running in a circle. It's not the track running that got me injured back then, but I know they are notorious for concerning ITB problems. 

So -- let's say I would try 12h -- do I need to run at least 150 km (93 miles)/week before I even try that or my current mileage is all I need? Feel free to give advice or two about nutrition and pacing strategy or your experience with this kind of running.",1606825768

ultrarunning,egoemt,"Long run training plan, long runs taking too long","Hello.
 
I am following a  [50m training plan](https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Free-50-mile-ultramarathon-training-plan-outline.png)

My issue is on the Saturday long runs due to the amount of vert the runs are starting to take a very long time. My last run was the Cutback week and I ran 14 miles with 3674 feet of elevation in just under 3 hours. I also felt like this was a decent pace for me probably a bit faster than my normal long run pace.

My issue is as I get up to the higher milages on the Saturday my runs are going to end up at 6-8 hours. This just seems like a very long time to run on a training day. I dont mind maxing up to this but doing it consistently for multiple weeks seems a bit much.

1. Is this fairly normal for a 50mile plan and I should just suck it up? 
2. Should I decrease the Vert on longer runs and do a trail thats less Vert or add in some flat loops?
3. Any other ideas apart from run faster?",1606787113
ultrarunning,egoemt,Is training on the route you are going to race always optimal?,"Hello.

I am training for a 100k in July. The route is a out and back over 47km with 2500m of elevation, mountain and technical trail and then a 6km flat run.

The route has it all, long hills, technical parts, flats, mud long downhills, steep hills, step etc etc etc.

I see a big consensus to train on the same type of trail you will be running on. 

My question is, apart from it being very boring would it be optimal to do all my training on this trail? Should I do my easy runs on a section, my long runs along sections, my hill repeats on a hill on the trail and my fast runs along the trail etc etc

Normally I do as much as I can on the trail but obviously this gets boring and its also relatively far from the house. Would it be okay to do my speed days on the track and then do easy runs around the city? should all my runs be on trail of some sort? Should all my runs have a decent amount of vert or is it okay to do some flat and make up for it with the hills days?",1606779049

I've started to learn more about ultrarunning (have run two now) and am wondering what people believe are the core principles.

The question comes about from John Reed's book, *Succeeding*, with the following quote: 

""When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don't. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.""

ultrarunning,JmBrkr,Looking for Virtual Events,"Hi! 

I'm looking for a Virtual 50k!

I've checked Ultrasignup and don't see too many on there. I've checked several other sites and am not seeing much, most of the search results I see from Google are events that have already happened. I feel like I'm being lazy and not digging deep enough, but I'm not seeing very many. The reason I'm asking you folks where to look is I keep hearing about virtual events AFTER the fact. I'm wondering if there is another platform that is more virtual event friendly.

Additional context, I'm a trail runner and I haven't been able to get out as much as I like. I feel like if I fork over some money to run the trails behind my house for the day, I'll feel obligated to get the miles in and will be able to get back into a training mindset.

ultrarunning,Cigats,50k build help,"Hey everyone!

I'm a new runner. I just started this time last year. I could use some help getting a 50k under my belt. I've run a few trail half marathons and recently did a trail 30k at 10:30 pace. It felt really good, i was running with someone and we were talking/laughing most of the way. I usually hit over 40 mpw with 2500-4500 vert. I've built my weekly mileage slowly over the last year. 

The only big changes I've made lately is doing more trail work instead of road. I ran too much road before a half and went way slower than I wanted to. I was a slave to low HR training which I think has held my pace back a little bit. But to be fair i have also been injury free which is more important to me. Most of my training is easy pace, but varies on trails - walk if/when needed. I do one harder workout a week, a 6 mile out and back with 1400 ft of vert, I just try to PR that section each time. I count it as my tempo/hilk/workout run.

So that's my background. I'd like to run my first 50k next year and maybe do a few. I found this plan here: [Hal Higdon]( https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/).  This program is nice because there are local trail half and full marathons that will be on the program schedule assuming i start the first week of December. My big questions are as follows:

1. The program recommends running trail. Most of my long runs until the last two months were road. Too boring. Will I still get the same aerobic benefits staying with trail long runs. Pace/HR is less consistent hence why I ask. Should I try to do as much trails as I want?

2. Should I keep the pace runs to road for an honest assessment?

3. Again I'm new  - what else am I missing?",1606374153
ultrarunning,ultracrockett,Gordy Ainsleigh's famous run,"In 1974, the most famous story in American ultrarunning took place, when **Gordy Ainsleigh** ran on the Western States Trail, in the California Sierra, during a 100-mile horse race, **without** his horse. At first, his run went unnoticed, until several years later when it became the icon for the newly established Western States 100 and for mountain trail 100-milers in general. He has given himself the credit for inventing ultrarunning.

In this episode of the Ultrarunning History Podcast, the place in history for his run is examined, and put in its proper historic context. Yes, you were told he was the first to cover Western States on foot, but he was actually the 8th, and the sport of trail ultrarunning was not invented that year. 

Also, 53 other people covered the Western States Trail on foot about a week after Gordy’s famed 1974 run. This forgotten tale is also told.

I'm currently running in a pair of Saucony Guide ISO 2s (I need a stability shoe) that I picked up on a whim as they were on sale. I've absolutely loved them - zero blisters, zero niggles and amazing cushioning up to 20 miles so far.

ultrarunning,75North_,Morning Musing,"Awaking to the sharp, sudden noise of falling raindrops on the cap of my pick up truck, I roll over, stretch my arms out of my cozy sleeping bag and the cold air pierces my comfort.  I had worked late last night, some walk-ins had showed up last minute and still being an apprentice, both needing the money and to pay my dues to the shop, I stayed late to tattoo them. Then, I had driven here, to a rural parking lot just outside of the trail. I inflated my slightly less than full size mattress, placed it on the plywood topper I built to store all of my outdoor gear, crawled into my sleeping bag and fell asleep.

I could just go back to sleep. Hell, I could drive home and go to sleep in an actual bed heated by a furnace. All of this is voluntary. These thoughts are interrupted by my remembering that if I wanted to stay comfortable and not push myself, I’d sign up and complete (not competitively) my local 5k. 

Pulling my body fully out of my sleeping bag I completely undress in the cold, the sharp rain hitting my tattooed skin. I quickly as possible change into all the running gear I’ll need for a 3 hour excursion into the woods. I open up a little cabinet I’ve built in the plywood topper, selecting a pack, a handful of energy gels and a hydration bladder. 

6:30AM and it’s time to get to get going. Smiling with both excitement and nervousness, I take my first running step onto the wooden pathway that winds for a couple hundred yards before turning into a single track moderately technical trail.

ultrarunning,amathie,First 100k six months from now?,"Hi folks,

Looking for some advice about my first 100k. I was hoping to enter the Zugspitz Ultratrail next year (mid June 2021), but want to know if it's realistic with a little over six months before the event. 

I have run 50k on two separate occasions in 2019 (not races, just solo). In the time since then, I haven't been running as much, but I've picked it up again as a way to stay sane since lockdown and have been putting in 30-40km weeks semi-consistently... 

Is it realistic for me to finish a 100k race in six months time? Many of the plans I've seen (e.g. Hal Koerner's) make it seem possible, but I don't want to drop money on the entry fee if I'm being delusional!

All honest feedback appreciated. Thanks!",1605691365

I recently completed a 50k ultra with 8000ft ish of vert.

I am intending to train for a 50m now using [This training plan](https://relentlessforwardcommotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Free-50-mile-ultramarathon-training-plan-outline.png)

Would I be okay to go right into it? 

Should I skip to maybe week 6 or so as My long runs are already in the 30km with 1200 very or 40km with less very range as of now.

For the hills stuff I am usually only covering about 3km due to the nature of the hill I run. Its about 120m gain over 800m and I run it 4-5 times uphill. Laps take about 3:30 or so and then the downhill I walk it so this takes up about an hour and a bit.

Should I do this more times at a slow pace? pick a less steep hill? Run the up and the down and at a slower pace? 

Otherwise I know the plan isnt very tailored but I think I can fill in the gaps. Any other advice or stuff you notice id appreciate the help thanks.",1605643797

2-3 weeks recovery.
2 weeks @ around 80k a week.
2 weeks of tapering.

ultrarunning,mattBLiTZ,Stupidly-long minimally-supported runs: stroller vs pack?,"This is a ridiculous question for 99%+ of us, but I figured this was still the best place to ask to satisfy my curiosity. I was reading Training for the Uphill Athlete and got to the section about Ricky Gates running across America (also featured in a popular video that was posted here a bit ago) and how he used a push-stroller to carry his stuff, especially in long unsupported stretches of desert with no water resupply. 

It got me wondering: at what point is pushing a stroller a better use of energy than carrying a pack? I started thinking the threshold might be pretty low, and that the only reason you don't hear more about it is that obviously very few of us are traveling long routes that are suitable for wheels while also carrying monster gear loads instead of having aid stations or a crew.

I'd be shocked but - does anyone here actually have personal experience with this style of ultrarunning? Super interesting niche, I suppose the ""cousin"" style of the sleds people drag during monster snowy routes in Antarctica and Alaska.",1605550431

ultrarunning,egoemt,Race report: Sweet go deep Ultramarathon,"Ran my first ultramarathon, thought I’d do a quick (actually, quite long) race report. Any advice from ultramarathoners for improvements in training and tactics welcomed - I was reasonably happy with how things turned out, but there’s a lot of room for improvement, and I'm very much a beginner at this kind of distance.

**Race**: Sweet go deep Ultramarathon in Deep Cove, British Columbia, Canada.  45 km, 8202 feet of ascent. The sweet go deep is held almost entirely on trails in the spectacular North Shore mountains above Vancouver, Canada. The trail surface is a mix of steep ascents and descents, technical terrain and fast, rolling groomed trails with approximately 2500m (8,000') of vertical change. In order to appeal to a wide range of experience levels and abilities, the course now offers 1 or 2 loops of 20km, and, since 2011, the popular 14K course option follows a ""lollipop"" route.

Due to Covid the race was started separately by all competitors and you just posted your time at the end to avoid groups etc. So it was also self supported.

**Experience**: Running for about 6 months.

**5k PR 18:52**

**10K PR 41:58**

Lots of weekly hilly runs (5km to 36km), Hill intervals, speed work on tracks and easy runs. Running about 4-6 times a week. 

Longest previous run about 36km with 1800m vert (training, not a race). No race experience.

**Training**: Started running about 6 months ago but went out way too hard. Done some long back to back days on weekend and knees were shot. Bought a bike to push through the training and hated it. realized I needed to calm it down a bit and get my conditioning up. So started to bring back the distance and lower the downhill running until my body could catch up. Just building up 10% per week. Also experimented with gels, nutrition etc 

**Objective**: Finish in 8 hours if not before it gets dark (9:30ish hours)

**Race**:

*KM 1-8*: Set off just after 7 with 1.5ltrs of concentrated gatorade (I have a habit of drinking too much and peeing every half hour), 100 grams of gummy worms and 2 cliff bars. Feeling good. Walking the uphills and running flats. Trying to keep the slow pace. forgot my gloves and as I ascend its getting cold, damn. Drinking some 1.5 concentrate gatorade and eating some gummy worms. First hour has passed and I am starting to see [Real Snow] (https://imgur.com/a/S6H4ik1) . 

*KM 8-10*: The big hill and its covered in snow, some parts a foot deep- I was absolutely not expecting this and the race usually isn't like this, early snowfall this season. I started at 7am as I wanted to finish before dark worse case scenario. This means I am the first person on the trail so there is no steps for me to walk in or tracks to follow the trail. I walk it and its incredibly hard. Every step the snow gives way and makes it really hard to continue on the uphill. The trail is impossible to see and I have to constantly check my phone for the GPX to make sure im on the track. 

I consider giving up at about 9km as i'm cold and my feet are feeling numb and I was not in the mood for a snow ultra. As i'm moving slowly I think this is a great time for my cliff bar, which unfortunately is rock solid due to the cold haha. I manage to gnaw some of it off and eat it. I finally reach the highest elevation and try to figure out where the trail turns left on the now covered MTB Trail.

*KM 10-12*: MTB trail with MTB features. I try to stay on the GPX and I am making slow progress, sometimes I can tell I am on the trail as I cross a jump, ramp or horizontal ladder for the MTBs, I Try to cross a downed log feature but slide on the snow coverage and fall off into the side. I make a mental note not to do any balancing acts on stuff with snow. Psychologically difficult, as I Have to route fine in the snow and sometimes the routes around the features are not ideal due to everyone using the features. Some sketchy parts and I end up off trail by a fair amount at a river crossing and just have to walk through it as the MTB crossing is very uphill. Very cold but I run perpendicular to the track and make it back. This is all downhill so I am able to run a little and slide into the snow. 

*KM 12-15*: - Two hours have passed as I reach KM 12 and this makes me way behind time, the snow has also exhausted me. The snow finally clears and its some downhills on MTB trails. This part is very fun as I can use the MTB features and I don't need to keep checking the GPX. Some of the features are sketchy but as I can now see the area around them I can pass easily. Starting to really enjoy it as I get into a rhythm I feel a bad need to pee. Pee and continue on, meet some MTBers using the trail but no issues. I eat some gummie worms and continue on. 

*KM 15-18*:  - ascent on MTB trails. lots of uphill for me to walk with some downhills in between, I try to sprint these and use the speed for the next uphill part , so I don't lose as much time as I might have otherwise. Run some sections,  I've slowed down a lot and am having to walk some of the downhill sections. I am way behind time and my legs feel really heavy. I make the calculations in my head and realize its going to be a longer run. 

*KM 18-24* Mainly downhill and some flats for now, This area I have run a lot so know it well. Keep constant pace and eat another cliff bar and some gummies as I go. Finish the first loop at 4 hours 24 minutes. 24 Minutes slower than I was hoping. It starts to rain heavily when I am in the car I am using as my only aid station. I consider giving up, I seen no tracks and only passed one runner with no runners passing me. I start to think maybe anyone sane didn't run the Ultra due to the snow and I might be the only person doing it. I am worried about reaching the snow and being too tired and possibly getting gassed up there. I had a few slips and close calls and I do not want to get injured up there and need to call SAR. 

I have only drank 400ml. Trying to only drink when thirsty means I may not have drank enough but at least I did not pee 5 times.
I decided i've done half of it and when I get to the snow I can assess up there. I drain the gatorade to 750ml and add some salt. Slam down a cliff bar and refill my vest with cliff bars and gummies. I dry my feet and change my socks. I also add my headlamp incase I will have to run as it gets dark. I run over to the toilet as i'm having bad gas and stomach pain. Have a quick poop and lots of gas and off I go.

*KM 24-32*: Feeling good but have a lot of gas.

*KM 32-35*: I reach the snow and decide to go through. Its much easier this time as I can put my feet in the tracks from before. This means the snow does not collapse and take all my energy away. I get through this section 23 minutes faster than last time. I also see someone else's tracks this time but they are going the opposite way (I briefly wonder if i'm running the race the wrong way lol) stomach bloated and uncomfortable feeling very gassy.

*KM 35-40*: Snow is much easier to progress through with my tracks, I also note not to go to low and off track this time and I see the MTB feature for crossing the river, its a thin downed log about 3 feet over the river with about a foot of snow covering it. I cross it attempting to balance and when i get to half way the snow gives way, My foot goes right and my head goes left. My body collides with the log between my left ribs and my hip and I then slide off into the water landing on my right hip and getting completely drenched. The water is very chilly so I make my way out of it ASAP but get tangled in branches at the sides and fall through the snow. 

Very pissed off I eventually manage to get out. Feeling very sorry for myself and with pain in both hips I keep running as otherwise i'm going to freeze. (this actually helped invigorate me lol) I run out of hydration at 37km drank 750 ml by this time when I had only drank 400 the whole time 1st loop. Having a lot of gas and stomach rumbling but feeling okay.

*KM 40-47.1*: Follow the same trails but somehow I feel fresher and am able to make through in a faster time than loop 1. Really feeling the hydration issues and have also eaten all my food. I think about asking some of the passing MTBers for 100ml of water but decide not to due to Covid.
 
I get down to about 45km and should be done due to the bad tracking on the other loop i realize I still have a few KM left and had been running too fast as I thought I was done soon. I really walk the uphills and try and run the flats but its hard. I eventually reach the final downhill to the finish and I am able to push through to the end. Finishing in just under 9 hours. 
 
**Result**: 8:56 for 47.12km and 2460m Elevation 

**Lessons**: 

More food and less concentrate gatorade. I only ate 1900 calories should have been around 2700 for this time.

Experience is important. I learned perseverance I wanted to give up at many of the times but the issues were not that big a deal. The okay get to this part and then quit if you want worked very well as once you make it you are generally feeling better. The top elevation being at KM 10/35 means once you are there you generally have to come down anyway so might as well continue. The loop works well as you know the route the second time but also makes it easy to quit halfway. I feel like there is waves of I want to quit followed by feeling great about an hour later so its important to push through.

I had no run most of the trails even without the snow, The trails were not flagged or anything for this race so this was not ideal. I could have been much faster and not used GPX as much if I knew generally what direction they went in or followed. I don't think its a good idea to race something you have not at least walked. I will definitely cover the trails before race day even if its not going to snow.
If i'm starting early as i'm slower ill probably be the first person on the trail and need to account for this.


I overpacked the hydration and food for the first loop (1.5ltr and 1200 calories) when I used a lot less than this I packed less for the second loop (750ml 800 calories) This was a bad idea and I should have packed at least 1ltr and 1200 calories as my usage was higher on the second loop. I thought I was overpacking but realistically I was not. 


The next Ultra I run id like to have already ran all the trails and also have it setup with aid stations and other runners to improve the experience.

I am just looking for some tips and advice on timing and other things that I may not have thought of.

**
Running about 6 months, no real background before. 

Longest run 6:09:21	36.53 km	1,885 m	(I could gave done more flat running but was 100% walking the uphills)

Last long run 3:57:28	28.92 km	1,200 m (Very comfortable could have done a lot more, power hiking the uphills and running downhills whole time)

Both of these were in similar conditions to the race. 

Questions.

1. How long should I plan for the race ? Im thinking 8 hours should be enough.
2. I will be using my car as an aid station and it will be at the start finish line, anything I should be conscious about due to this ?
2. I am thinking of starting at 7am as it gets dark at around 4pm here, is this too late? 
3. I have a very small bladder so need to pee every 30 minutes if drinking, due to this I do not drink water when running but instead  1 1/2 strength Gatorade any issues with this as the run gets longer? Should I take some water also?
4. I usually just eat a cliff bar every hour and swallow some gummy worms whole as nutrition? Should I include some real food ? (I have never eaten real food in training)
4. I have a 2ltr camelback I was planning on filling it fully and then adjusting the fill to required when I get back from the first loop, would this be too much weight for 23km 1200m vert? Should I plan to drink less.
5. Due to the snow I will be bringing a second pair of socks for dry feet for the return part, any other items I should bring?
6. I am thinking of just walking the uphills from the beginning to make sure I finish, Is this a good idea or should I reduce speed on the flats and downhills and powerhike the uphills to conserve myself ?

ultrarunning,still_linky,Am I ready to do 100km?,"Hi, Community 😀

The breakless freight train of shit that has been 2020 has yielded some surprisingly good results on the running front. 

When UTA50 (Ultra Trail Australia, 50km) was cancelled I wallowed in self-pity for a week then pulled my finger out and committed to a run streak: 4km (2.5mi) every day, focus on vert, maintain weekend long runs. Touch wood, I'm injury-free, recovering quicker, able to eat lots on the run (medium cheeseburger meals 🤤) and much more in-tune with the bod than last year. I have grossly exceeded my yearly vert/mileage totals of years prior. I'm not race fit but feel I have a great base. 

Currently I run 7 days, about 55km/week with ~1200m vert and 1 dedicated longy of 25-30km each week. I prefer trails, and have access to them, but spent more time on roads this year due to it being winter. I have no structured plan other than this but have capacity to be way more purposeful. I feel I could go longer on the long runs, and in overall weekly mileage, but am mindful of ramping up too quick and undoing all the work (which has happened before). 

As for distance, I did a 50km flattish road run pretty easily this year but have not run further than this since 2005.

My Q is: how will I know if I'm ready for UTA100 which is in May 2021 and is 100km (62mi) long, 4400m (14500 feet) in vert?

ultrarunning,34kj234jkfdsm32klj,I got injured and took two weeks off. The 50k is Saturday. Would it be dumb to race it?,"I have a 50k, my first 50k, on Saturday. But two weeks ago I decided I wouldn't run it. Over the course of the fall, I've twisted my ankle several times. It happened again about 2.5 weeks ago. It hurt and I knew I had to take time off because it was swollen and immobile. I'm not sure it's the worst twisted ankle of the last six months but that just speaks to how many times I've injured this same right ankle.

I had been training for a few months and keeping up with it before this injury. I took 2 weeks off. This week I finally started running again. It felt pretty garbage the first couple of times but today I ran five miles in the rain on the road and felt good. Five miles on the road and 50k on the trail are two different beasts. A part of me wants to run because I trained for it, this was the goal. But another part of me is worried about this bad period -- injury, no running, way off my training plan -- putting me at higher risk for DNF or, much worse, serious injury.

I'm not sure how to think this decision through. The only other thing I can think to mention is about the injury. In the last six months, I've twisted my ankle a handful of times mostly on slippery trails either due to protruding roots or slippery leaves (and maybe hidden roots too then, I don't know). The 50k this Saturday is on a trail with lots of both. It's not technical in the way I see most people talk about it but the race directors do warn about the factors I mentioned because people do make missteps.

I'm running a 50k this weekend in the GA mountains, and crews are not allowed due to COVID restrictions. However, I am allowed a drop bag. There will be aid stations with water, Gatorade, Coke, ginger ale, peanut butter and jelly, salt, cookies. 

The weather looks great for the run, but it will be raining a few days before, resulting in possibly wet conditions. The race has over 6k in elevation.

I am the developer for the event calendar that UltraRunning Magazine. [https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/](https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/)

Another post here got me thinking of asking the community on how we can do a better job. 

Our primary goal is to have every ultra in North America. We have an open platform for any RD to manage their own listings. Sadly most don't so 90% of the updating and management falls on us. 

We try and make the searching/filtering of events on the home page as quick and simple as possible. We have your standard filters (distance, state, region, month). We do our best to assign surface and elevation rating to each course, scale of 1-5 on each, so there are filters for that.

Outside of the basics, are there any other criteria you would want to filter events by? Any and all ideas are welcome.

Thanks",1604971666

I love running in cool weather the best.  But there isn't a lot of cool weather in Puerto Rico and the heat is killing my speed and endurance.  

I am about 6ft and 200 lbs (not the smallest runner). Typically I run 6-7 miles daily, with about 600 ft climb at about 8:30 pace.  I have been slowly building up my daily mileage...trying to get to 10 miles daily.  

This week my body has been running out of energy after about 3-4 miles in the sun.  The heat is making me slow. My legs start feeling heavy pretty fast...and the heat and humidity is just crushing me.  Today I went out for a 3 mile run...and I seemed to manage an 8:30 min pace (pretty normal) despite the heat.  But I doubt I could have maintained it for another 1-2 miles. 

My assumption is that my body will adapt to the heat/humidity and eventually I will ""get used to it"" and my mileage will climb back up.

And by subjective, I mean the weather and my performance during the race factor heavily into where the race lands on the list.  I'm happy to have done all these races and would recommend all of them to anyone looking to challenge themselves at the distance.

 

1. **Eastern States** \- A beautiful and hard course, which broke me physically and mentally. . . and yet I was still able to finish.  I now go back every year to relive that accomplishment.
2. **Old Dominion** \- Really 1a instead of #2.  I love the course profile (trails, roads) and the old school feel of the race.  I experienced my highest highs and lowest lows here and got my buckle by 15 minutes (only given to sub-24 hour finishers).  I need to get back.
3. **Oil Creek** \- You never forget your first.
4. **Olde 96er** \- What's harder than running 100 miles?  Running 100 miles with no aid stations, crew, or support of any kind.  Probably my best executed race outside going off course for a couple miles.
5. **MMT** \- Very hot the year I ran and the last hill is just ridiculous.  
6. **Pine Creek** \- How is my 100 mile PR this far down the list?!?!?!
7. **NJ Ultra Fest** \- While the course may be a little generic, this was one of my better executed races.
8. **Cloudsplitter** \- Pretty course.
9. **Umstead** \- Poor weather the year I ran, but one of my better performances.
10. **Bighorn** \- This would be a top 3 race if I hadn't DNFed at the turnaround.  Stupid altitude.
11. **Burning River** \- I liked the varied course profile, but not my best executed race.
12. **Long Haul** \- Pushed too hard early and paid the price.  Beware the hot January weather in FL if you're from up north.
13. **C&amp;O Canal** \- DNFed my first attempt, poorly executed second go, and rainy 40 degree temps both years.

I'm hoping to field some different perspectives on how you all might approach my current situation.  I'm about 2.5 weeks from my first 50 mile race.  I wrapped up my peak weeks with a 22 mile run this past weekend, but have come down sick since then.  Now I have gotten a Covid test and am awaiting results, so any hypotheticals here will be assuming a negative result! (If positive, well that will be a whole different scenario.) I had a spike of a fever for about 24 hours on Monday, and have had a sore throat and cold symptoms in the days since. I've managed shortened versions of my scheduled runs, but on today's had to call it early due to dizziness/weakness. 

I'm scheduled for one more long run, \~18mi, this weekend before starting the taper. I'm wondering, at this point in the training, how detrimental is it to miss these training runs? Is there a point of days off at which you wouldn't expect to rebound and be race ready? I'm prepared to rest a few days to get back to health,  but if a few days turns into a week or more, will I be wildly undertrained?

Up until now, training has gone really well with a peak around 60mpw, long runs feeling great and basically no missed runs in my plan.

For those not familiar, the overall premise is you run/walk the miles for the corresponding day.

You can break it into chunks throughout the day, or run/walk but you have to do the miles in the 24 hours of that specific day. I got the initial idea from Jesse Itzler who did it in February of this year and I thought it would be a great challenge idea. With the wildfires in the mountains and needing a break from climbing, I figured October would be a good month to do it. It ended up being late nights, early mornings, Midnight miles before an early morning flight to Chicago, and 25 miles in a Denver blizzard with a high of 15 degrees but it was worth it.

ultrarunning,Thehealthygamer,Finished my first 24 hour race! Would like some advice on training/food.,"Finished my first 24 hour race today. Super beautiful course out in Moab, UT.

The race was a 7.1 mile loop. About 800ft of gain in the first 3.5 miles then flat downhill road back to the start/finish.

Wore a Whoop, here's some of that data. Thought it was kinda interesting. 

Beginning: https://ibb.co/tzJZ9g3
End: https://ibb.co/597zyzT

The goal was to hit 100 miles. Was doing pretty good, did 12 laps at 85.2 miles in 20:15. Then my left knee just flared up and decided it didn't want to bend anymore. Something in there was super inflamed. So I just hobbled around the 1/2 mile camp loop for the last 3:45. Ended up with 95.75 miles with 9,795 of gain.

I've done a 53 miler before this so this was the first past that mileage. 

Actually pretty happy with the results because I only had about 3 weeks of train up and the longest run I did was a 15 miler. Worked wildland fire this year and we were on fires for 4 months straight until Oct, so I'd spent 3 months prior without running at all, just a lot of hiking up steep mountains with a heavy pack. 

So, questions:

* How much weekly mileage is ideal going into a 100?

* I ate A LOT. Lots of candy, lots of tater tots and bacon and whatever else they had. Was putting down ~3-400 cals an hour. Drank a bunch of sports mix and coke. My stomach really started to just feel... unwell. Pooped about 5 times on the course and by the end I just had this achy stomach that felt like I might shit myself at any time. This lead to me not eating anything but fruit for the last 3 hours and my performance noticeably dropped and I went deeply hypoglycemic until I finally ate some pancakes. Any strategies to rectify this or just part of ultras?

ultrarunning,Thrusthamster,I did three 50Ks in 2 months as a beginner,"I decided this summer to try for a Norwegian award called ""Ultrafatet"" (the Ultra Plaque/Plate I guess). I haven't been running much but I had 3 years of lots of long days of mountaineering behind me, and doing up to 6 hours of stair climbing and box stepping behind me.

For my training I could already do a fairly okey half marathon, and tried to do about 3 runs a week, gradually increasing my long run. Tried to stick to trails to at least get some elevation gain in (I used to do 3000-5000 a week on the box and stairs). My longest runs for training I built up to 26 km, at a much slower pace than the races.

I didn't feel ready during early summer since I started running around June, so I picked out 3 races that happened after my summer vacation in August. The races I signed on for started getting cancelled. Eventually I got signed up for 2 small races and 1 bigger race that didn't get cancelled probably because it was in an area with few covid infections. 

Purposefully I signed up for the flattest races I could find to try to increase my chance of completing it.

First 50K went in a roughly 5K loop. I ran at what I thought would be a comfortable pace, and I did manage to keep that pace almost the whole way. In the end I did it in 5h59m. I won my class because I was the only guy in it, but the only other guy doing the 50K had apparently run 200 marathons and he was only 2 minutes ahead of me. I think what helped me do the race was pain tolerance and mental strength from all the mountaineering (usually feels like you'll never get to the summit). Also the race going in a loop made it easier to motivate myself and make sure to not walk too much. Still, after the marathon, the last 8 km or so were a lot of walking as my hip flexors and feet were killing me. Also, ball chafing. 

I walked normally again after around 24 hours (which I've found is a general rule for me so far).

Next race had 4x the elevation gain with around 800m where about half of it was the last 3 km. 57 km in total but I thought if I manage the first 50K the last 7 km I'll crawl up or something.

This was self-supported so I brought 2 muesli bars for every hour and kept that going for the whole race (for magical 300 calorie ceiling I've heard of). First 25 km was fine. Then I struggled a lot and walked a lot, took too many pee breaks between 25-40 km. Then I got a second wind and could run more or less without stopping until the last uphill. Already made a deal with myself that I'd walk the last hill. I was last at 25-40 but passed 4 people in the last 17 km. Still the last 10 km was probably the longest 10K I've ever done. Did the 50K in 6h30m and the 57K in 7h49m.

The last race I trained much more beforehand but nothing more than about 40 km a week with building up my long run. Also introduced the box steps for one of my weekly sessions. 

The last race was 50K, in the dark yesterday. I pulled through fine, but I did the 50K in 7h14m this time. It could be that doing 3 ultras in 2 months as a beginner might lead to getting some long-term fatigue that you don't really notice. But this race I ran the whole way, had to walk much less, and wasn't in that much pain. Maybe 3 out of 10 for 6 hours.

In case anyone reads all this I just thought I'd offer my experience as a beginner coming from another stamina sport. I had run a bit before but literally 1 or 2 runs a year was what I did. But I think if you're used to 8-16 hour effort several days in a row like from mountaineering, and you can run a half marathon without dying, you only need a few months of getting your muscles used to running to do a 50K.

In my opinion he's the undisputed GOAT of ultrarunning.  Curious to hear others' perspectives on:

1. His unconditional training methods - eg rarely ran more than 80mpw and no single training run longer than 12mi

2. And yet his 24hr record (188.59mi) may never be broken?  (Can't even wrap my head around sustaining 7:38 min/mi pace..for an entire day).

ultrarunning,Hairy_Statistician,I guess that's what it's like to hit the wall,"&lt;rant&gt;

Trained all year for a hundred miler. Covid happened. Race got rescheduled. Trained some more. Race got cancelled.

Planned to do my own. Family stuff happened. 100 milers turned into 100K, which turned into a 50 miler, then a 50K.

Started my run this morning with absolutely nothing left in the tank. Nada. Void. ""E"". I just didn't want to be there. Nevertheless, I pushed on. It was pretty on top of a mountain. Windy and cold AF. I got that strong ""go home"" vibe.

So I did.

Now for the lesson learned: 54+ guy needs a break. Physically and mentally. This year is a bust. I trained my old carcass so hard and it's been for nothing. 

My body has been screaming at me to stop.  I just haven't been listening.

ultrarunning,Ainur95,How hard is to finish UTMB under 30 hours?,"Last days I have some fantasies about that mythical race and I hope to see myself one day in Chamonix. Obviously, that is on hold for quite some time, but building base and collecting kilometres daily and monthly is going pretty well (knock-knock!).   


I consider myself for more than a recreational runner, but still an amateur who really loves running and spending time on feet. For the last few months my average weekly mileage was a little over 100 km with at least 2000 m of elevation. That's not much climbing considering mileage, but for now I think it's enough. There are no races, no projects, just building base. And for now I'm not planning to raise weekly mileage, going above that probably includes days with double runs and I'm not sure that I need them right now.   


Just a glance on my average week: 

Monday: strength 

Tuesday: 16 km w/450 m of elev. @ 4:47/km 

Wednesday: 10,6 km @ 5min/km (flattish trail, &lt;100 m of elev.) 

Thursday: 23 km w/560 m of elev. @ 4:51/km 

Friday: like Wednesday 

Saturday: 31,5 km w/1,213 m of elev. @ 5:30 or slower 

Sunday: 10,6 km reeeally easy on that flattish trail

   
I'm not a big fan of speed work, but when I do any fast running, it's 12 km in 45 minutes (3:45/km). I have this loop around my house and it's either really slow running (above 1 hour) or that fast (fast for my terms).  

So -- you have some picture about me and my running. I have few ultras in my legs, but neither is longer than 80 km. UTMB or any 100 miler is other world and I have no experience in it, but I have time and I have will to correct and improve my running.

I've been reading this sub since before I could even run a mile, just dreaming about the day I could call myself an ultra runner. And today is that day! 

Not posting a full race report, just my quick story from Couch to Ultra to help other newbies like myself. I did a lot of things the wrong/hard way, but learned so much.

Race info - 50k, Crushed Limestone Trail, Out and Back, only 1000ft elevation, 15 degrees.

I made my A goal of sub 6 hours with only a min to spare - 5:58:30.

**Training.**

I started Couch To 5K in June of 2019. I literally could not run half a mile. I weighed 220 at 24% Body Fat at 6 feet tall then. I made great progress and right afterward started a 14 week Half Marathon Training Plan. I completed the half in October 2019. That initial progress was amazing but filled with issues and questions. I went through so many kinds of shoes, braces, orthotics, youtbube videos, stretches, foam rolling, and injuries...It was overwhelming, but I stuck with it. Also during this time I started biking like crazy too which helped increase my fitness and lose weight fast. It was a great combo and I went hard in both...too hard as Ive death with the following injuries in the last 16 months that have been some huge physical and mental set backs.

Planters Facetious, ITBS, Stress Fracture, Knee Pain, 2 Broken Ribs, Type 3 Shoulder Seperation, Extensor Tendonitis, and all the normal growing pains like shin sprints and tight calves. I am now free of all of these except the Extensor Tendonitis, but Im in PT now and hope to finally run truly pain free. 

After the Half I started a 50k Training plan for a race that would be late Jan 2020. I stuck to it as long as I could, but those injuries caught up to me and I had to drop out. After a bad bike crash I lost two months of training and literally started over again in Feb 2020 with the same Half marathon training plan. But I worked it. I worked on my form, my warm ups, my cool downs, strength training, and started caring less about breaking a new 5 or 10k every time I ran and stuck to growing my base through HR training.  Many of my races were canceled due to covid, but finally I had a chance at a small inaugural race near my home city that was doing a 50k.

Butttt, at about mile 14 (which has been a comfortable distance for me for a while) my ankles started getting really sore and I couldn’t tell if I was pushing too hard or not. 
It was on the inside of both of them, and they just began to become sore in a way they never have before. This lasted consistently throughout the rest of the race.

It is the next day, and my legs feel great but I can hardly walk on my ankles.
Has anyone ever experienced this? Or even just crazy soreness coming from virtually nowhere?

ultrarunning,FlygonFlyon,Looking for new shoes,"I've been looking around for some new shoes for trail and road, and am having trouble. For reference I run 40+ miles weekly, and my last shoes have been the Merrell Trail Glove 5, Altra Lone Peak 4.5, and Altra Kayenta. I like Altra but they're so pricey, and they always seem to wear down quicker than id expect. I keep crawling back because they offer the zero drop, and have a relatively small stack height.

ultrarunning,Janalon,Thoughts on the Impact of Stress + Ultra Recovery on Resting Heart Rate,"I'd love to know your thoughts on the impact of Stress + Ultra Recovery on Resting Heart Rate.

I ran my first 55 mile trail race over the weekend. And it was a 'virtual' event at that. A group of runners committed to the race day course, and stashed water and supplies along the route at miles 22, 35, and 43. The food and water was less frequent and plentiful than a typical aid station.  I carried 8lbs of water + food &amp; supplement in my hydration vest. From an aid station perspective, it was stressful to manage- especially the prospect of missing a stash. 

I was on course with about 10 runners- five running a 100mi, and 5 running the 55. They were all faster than me. My prospects were to run at a 'comfortable' pace, but run solo for the entire race OR punch above my desired pace to keep with the pack, and then manage the suck in the back half of the course. I opted for the latter. It's a shitty race-day strategy, but better than the alternative. I understood the consequences and was willing to pay the price.

[https://www.strava.com/activities/4178290264](https://www.strava.com/activities/4178290264)

My resting heart rate is in the low 50's. I'm a public school teacher, and my students have returned back to school under a 'hybrid' plan one week prior to race date. This bumped my resting heart rate up +6 BPM the week prior to the race. My taper runs looked like they were +10 BPM above what I would expect for a relaxed pace. The first 24 hours following the finish, my average resting heart rate was 77. The day after that 66. I'm back down into the 50's three days after. 

I'm not at all shocked that work caused an elevated heart rate. Yay stress. However, I didn't expect to see my HR elevated so high for so so many days after the race. Is this a typical experience? Or due to the fact that I ran such a stressful event?",1602587669
ultrarunning,reschly,Is there a secret to running 100 miles,"I've completed a 50k/31M race (1 of 1).  
I've completed a 40M race (1 of 1)  
I've completed 50M races (2 of 3).  
And a bunch self-supported runs of 20+ miles and/or 5K+ vert.

I attempted my first 100M (15K vert) event this past weekend, but at mile 60 (11k vert) was feeling sore (calves, ankles, knees) and started to have troubles eating food, which has in the past correlated with ""you're not going to finish and are also going to have a really bad time"".  The next potential drop point at this event was 15 miles away, so I made the low-risk choice to drop at 60M (there's always another event, right?).

Is there a secret to avoiding a sore lower body?  Nutrition seemed fine before the 60M aid station (no puking, ate something every hour or so; never felt under-salted like I did in my failed 50M).  I wore the same shoes (Asics) that have gotten through my other events).  Never ran out of fluid in my pack. Lungs were great (rode 18 miles on bike the day after). Someone mid-event suggested ibuprofen to dull the pain, but I think I'd want to be aware of any pain to avoid long-term damage.  

Is there a secret to avoiding lower body pain?  Is pain a warning to stop or a challenge to overcome?  Is that something everyone deals just guts out?",1602562230

ultrarunning,1320401,Eating Mentality,"TL;DR - I got into running 8 years ago to lose weight and followed a calories in/calories out approach. I'm on my third year of ultrarunning and the nutrition aspect is my downfall. Any suggestions on for ways to break a food/exercise weight loss mentality and embrace a food for fuel mindset?

When I first started running eight years ago I was an overweight guy in his late 20s. I worked a job that had me traveling 90% of the time, my food choices were poor and I just added on the pounds with ease. I quickly came to the realization that something had to change so I started tracking calories to the extreme. Everything consumed was tracked and every calorie expenditure was tracked. It worked, I lost weight quickly, I developed muscles I'd never had. I was relatively injury free and just enjoying it.

I ran three to six miles a day for five years. But then I started to dabble in longer distances. Maybe I should do a half-marathon? Working my way up to that distance went fairly well, of course some stupid injuries along the way, but it was fun to go further. I bought some Gu because that's what people did on long runs, right? When running a half, I'd have a Gu. Didn't know why, don't think it really helped my half-marathon performance. I was doing well, running sub 90 minutes for most of my races. Having fun!

Then came the 50k. I found a group to run with, we had a great time doing two, three, four-plus hour trail runs. It was so much fun! But, I needed to learn to eat more before, durning, and after. And forget about calories in/calories out for weight loss; rather I needed to focus on calories in/calories out to keep moving.

It's been hard to make that mental shift. I still worry about one day ballooning back up to my 200+lb self. And now, in my mid-30s I wonder if I'd ever get it back down. As proof to myself that this can happen, I've added 15lbs from my lowest weight. My wife says I was too thin back then and she is probably right. But that nagging feeling is hard to shake.

This past weekend I was helping a friend with an Everesting attempt on a local hill. I had originally planned to do the full thing but decided earlier in the week to just do six hours as I'm dealing with some injuries. Since it was only going to be six hours, I didn't plan the nutrition. To be clear, I had a ton of food in our car aid station. I had peanut butter, nutella, bread, chips, candy, soda. But, none of it was prepared. So it never got consumed. What was to be six hours turned into eight (by choice - we were having fun) but I hadn't fueled for eight. In retrospect, I ate less than 2,000 calories for eight hours and 11,000' of climbing in 13 miles. My last lap up I bonked hard and couldn't recover so called it a day. I continued to feel like crap for a good chunk of the day - all because I didn't take nutrition seriously. I had a plan for it but I failed to execute it well (that's the motto for 2020's training, so at least I'm consistent).

Going forward, I know I need to prepare food that I intend to eat. Races are great because I have no problem eating at an aid station. Where I've faltered is on these long training runs without a good plan. Aside from better planning, I would love other suggestions for ways to break that mental weight loss game and embrace a food for fuel mindset.",1602509548
ultrarunning,spooklordpoo,Does anyone wear regular road shoes for trail ultras?,"I tend to struggle with finding a trail shoe I really love and that works for me.   


Did a 100k the other weekend in some salomon sense rides and after I got to a road section about 11 hours in, the moment my feet hit the road, my feet just felt incredibly damn sore.   


Normally I run in Hokas for trails, but in the speedgoat 4 my pinky toes will feel numb and in the speedgoat Evo i just feel not confident in my step (running on slants etc)

&amp;#x200B;

The salomon sense ride 2/3s feel perfect to me, but the lack of cushion definitely was rough. I'm a little heavier around 5'10.5 height and sit around 177-181 lbs (80ish kgs and 180cm roughly), I'm also a slow runner and about 1.5 years into the hobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm wondering if anyone here just runs their trail ultras in road shoes as I am quite happy in the road shoes I frequent. Do you think I need to just get better and be able to handle more miles in my Salomons? Or, suck it up and wear the Hokas and just deal with how they feel?

ultrarunning,Sharnington,Race report - Taupo Ultra 74km,"A few weeks ago I posted here about undertaking my first Ultra.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/ieqkkz/6_weeks_out_from_my_first_ultra_74km/

Yesterday was race day and had such a good day out on the course.

I finished in 18th out of 65ish runners with a time 9 hours 8 minutes. 

Started out at 4am getting dropped off at the bus and then taken to a ferry to be dropped at our start line on a remote beach across the lake. 

Running started around 7.30, felt good for the first 10-15km and kept a nice pace. Plenty of climbing and some rolling farmland

Made sure I eating and taking on plenty of fluids (something I've been bad at in training) and took walking breaks on uphills to conserve my energy(THANKS REDDIT) 

Felt really good up until the 22-25km mark and hit my first wall. My legs just started seizing up and I went into panic mode. Luckily I found someone in a similar situation and we walked it out and kept each other going for 2-3km and I came out the otherside. Was such a relief.

After my first wall I had a surge of relief and adrenaline and decided I was going to make up for the lost time. Went hard for 25mins and clawed back some time and got my pace back on track.

Going so hard after having some trouble may not have been the best call as I went through another period of pain and had to slow right down. This time round was mentally tolling as I was starting to think the rest of the race was going to be a pattern of this (wall, me trying to push through, more pain).

After the second wall was broken I began to feel alot better and my body sort of accepted what was to come. Walked and ran my way through the next section making sure I was not letting my pace drop away.

Persevering into the 50km aid station and my fiancee and kids were waiting there for me. Seeing them was such a relief and was exactly what I needed. 

Directly after the aid station was a hard climbing section. I gritted my teeth and visualized getting to the finish line.
Amazingly I started to feel a second wind and my body was responding well. I went as hard as I could through the last 24km. 

Once I had about 6km to go I really put my foot down and racked up some 6-7 minute kms to the finish. 

Crossing the finish line was the biggest relief. Was overwhelmed with endorphins and couldn't  believe that I had actually done it. I hugged my kids and fiancee, grabbed a cup of soup from the food tent and lay on my back and looked at the clouds contemplating my life LOL.

Amazing experience! Can't wait for the next one!",1602361027

### Training
I had signed up for my first ultra that was supposed to be 10/10/2020 but was cancelled early September. I was bummed but decided to continue training. I thought about going somewhere new for my solo race but work got busy and for safety reasons it would be better to stay close to home. There is a half marathon on 10/10 that will use the same course I've been running and training on and I didn't want to be bothered with that. So I ran this morning 10/9.

I followed the Hal Higdon ultra (50k) plan https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/ . I started the plan on April 12 so just shy of 6 month of training! I am also a streak runner so on rest days I still ran my 3 miles (easy). I didn't do speedwork and just kept to the trails. I live in similar geography of where the ultra was set to be.

In addition to running every morning I would change and walk my dog a mile as my cool down, followed by a short yoga routine. Every other day I would do the /r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine to keep some muscle/strength.

Diet was vegan (plant-powered!). Oatmeal with ground flaxseed, walnuts, and blueberries. Lunch would usually be PBJ. Dinner rice and beans or pasta. Keeping things simple. Lots of veggies, water, and kombucha. Cut way back on alcohol. I lost about 15 pounds, dropping to ~140. 

Training fuel for anything longer than 8 miles would be a GU gel before the run, plus some tailwind in my bottle. For longer runs I would have one bottle of water, one bottle of tailwind, plus a GU for every ~50mins or so. Once I got longer distance (I forget when, I had the 1.5L water bladder plus 2 bottles of tailwind in bottles.

### Pre-race
During the long runs in training (4+ hours) I would get bad GI stuff brewing and on my last 30mile run I barely made it home in time. Did some reading and decided to try imodium (hence the goal of not shitting my pants). The afternoon I was able to set up all of my gear, fill my bottles, got someone to walk the dog in the morning, and got to bed early. No new foods, just keeping it simple. Staying hydrated. Charged my watch and MP3 player. Loaded up my This American Life podcasts (eps 397-404)

### Race
Early start! I woke up about 3:45am, a little late. Loaded up stuff, took one imodium pill and a GU gel plus water. Left the house about 4:10. Still dark out and had my head lamp. 

First 10 miles were on a counterclockwise loop around town. This is the direction I usually go each day different distances, out and back (so I catch the sunrise). This loop was entirely in the dark. One GU, not much water or tailwind as it was cool out. Saw a coyote pup on the trail that scared the shit out of me. Jumped out in front of me before running off but still close.

Miles 10-19 were most of another loop. Cut short to avoid crossing a street. Just pure uninterrupted trail! Got to watch the sunrise over the buttes, and then when I reached the far side of the loop I saw the Vermillion Cliffs lit up. Enjoying myself.

Miles 19-26.75 Turned around and ran back the way I came. The sun has gone up so I wasn't running directly into the sun. Just chugging along.

Miles 26.75-30.15 Turned around again to avoid crossing streets. This was grueling mentally.

Miles 30.15-35.15 Hit my turnaround point and was on the home stretch! This was awesome! I tried to relax a little bit, just finish. I know once I got to mile 32 I kept telling myself 'it's just 3 miles. I've run at least 3 miles every day for over a year. I got this'. Hit a bit of a wall here, ran out of water, and my tailwind was warm and gross lol



### Post-race
FINISHED! Got back about 10:30. Was excited to get home and just out of the sun. Did my yoga to stretch a little bit. Checked my water and it was empty (1.5L). Tailwind I started with 1L and had about 5oz left. I ate 4 or 5 GU Gels. Some breakfast and a shower. Was able to clock in to my meetings at noon. Didn't take any time off just clocked in late lol.

ultrarunning,Capt_Darling8,"An insight into running my first 100miles. Trust me, I learned a lot.","So 2020, what a year. This time last year I paid to enter the Robin Hood 100mile Race. 100 Miles around Sherwood Forest (well, twice). I even entered a few shorter ultras as build up throughout the year which were obviously cancelled. My story starts here...


Firstly, running a 100 miles is the hardest physical activity I have ever completed, this includes 9 years in the Army and all Sandhurst has to throw at you.  That said, I planned for the challenge and expected it to be hard.  I ran (and walked) the 100miles in 19hours and 40minutes. I'm very proud of this time!


2020 has been a difficult year, and my plan was very much thrown out of the window.  My build up was to include training races and training beginning in December 2019 to build up. A 30km race in February, Marathon in April (cancelled), 75KM ultra in May (postponed until 2021), Double Marathon (postponed until 2021).

With hindsight, the postponed races really hurt my preparation. Let me explain, I'd only run one marathon and one ultra before, my understanding of refuelling, pacing, kit, equipment and tactics was shabby to say the least. I've been a runner for 2 and half years with a handful of 10km and half marathons...  I really needed to get more experience, it didn't happen and I needed to rely on my training runs.

Training.  Well, this was a shambles!  I can run a 16min 5km, and a  34min 10km. Since the 30k race, my training slowly ramped up. With being furloughed, I had time to train and recover. However, with no races I did just that, a 7 month training block was very long, and I'm certain I peaked a month early.  The other proble, with my training was it was too fast. I never trained at race pace - all my running was too fast. Even my long runs were far faster than they should have been, and not as far. My longest runs were only 50km, and whilst I ran this distance a few times, with hindsight, it wasn't as far.

I also joined a running group aimed closer to middle distance to 10k running in the late summer and whilst this has massively increased my speed, I dont think it helped me much for an ultra..

The race...

Well, this started rather well - at 50km I was in the lead, running with the chap who would eventually go on and win, however at 50km my problems started....  I still don't know why,  but my calfs started cramping quite considerably. As I tend to run on my toes, this became a impossible - i had to change to heal striking as I ran just to continue.  To put it in perspective, my calfs were cramping so much at 50km, I could barely stand.  With the change in running style, somehow I managed to continue but this brought its own problems.  I hadn't trained to run that way, and quickly this became hard on my quads.  By 50miles, I was 2nd but struggling!

Crewing.  My wife crewed for me from mile 50, and I'll say this now - neither of us had any experience of this but without her, I genuinely wouldn't have finished the race. We had arranged to meet at every aid station and she would supplement me with food and kit as required.  This was the biggest success of the run, and actually went really well. Unfortunately,  by 70 miles I could barely eat. My nutrition plan, out of the window, I was hanging on.... just.

The final 30miles....

I've heard an Ultra starts at the halfway point, well I'd argue that up to 70 miles, I was running and was still moving in a positive manner, however it was from here my race started going downhill, quickly....  70miles to 80miles my running decreased and walking became more prevalent, I was struggling to eat and managed to get calories on board with a Guinness.  From 80miles, I was starting to struggle.  Running was becoming increasingly difficult and I was feeling nauseous from my failed nutrition plan.  At mile 87, it was all about to become undone!

The final half marathon.

Let me just say, if I could have kept on running at this point, I probably would have save at least an hour, if not more.  I couldn't run at all any more. When I tried, I was sick. I couldn't eat, I was sick. The only liquid that I could keep down was Tea.  With 13 miles at 4mph (max), I took my time. I also lost time at the last 2 aid stations, especially the last one - 20mins whilst I waited for a gas kettle and had a cuppa! 3miles left, I bimbled to the finish line.


What did I learn?...

1. You can't beat experience, with my cancelled races I couldn't develop or plan a decent nutrition plan, learn from my training and learn for the next one...

2. Training. I genuinely believed that if you train fast. You can slow down for the race and be fine. Oh my god, how naive! Had I trained at race pace, well, I suspect I wouldn't have cramped so early in the race....

3.  Nutrition. I couldn't eat or drink for the last 30miles... I reckon I didn't get the first 50miles right either and that's why... 

4. 100miles is very, very hard. Completing it is a genuine challenge.

5.  Do I want to do it again? No. The recovery after is far too long. Even a month later, I'm struggling to run any distance or speed... that said, my postponed races will definitely be fine.


Hope this helps anyone thinking about running a 100miles, or already signed up! Good luck!",1602193895

I'm doing it on a workday (lol) because there is a half marathon event on saturday and it uses the same route I've been training on. Didn't want to wait until Sunday because I am TIRED. I want to be finished! 

Getting all my gear prepped and hoping to get to bed early. Would like to be out the door by 4am so I can complete one 10 mile loop in the dark, start the second 10 mile loop with a beautiful sunrise, then to mix things up the third 10 mile loop will be the opposite direction. The final 5 miles will come from just a 2.5 out and back. I'm hoping to be done by 10/10:30. I have meetings at noon lol",1602181196
ultrarunning,fnmd2021,Seeking Participants for Ultrarunning + Diet and Nutrition Survey,"Hi all,

I am an ultrarunner and a fourth-year medical student, and as an extension of one of my electives this year, I developed a survey to examine diet and nutrition in ultrarunners, both in-competition and out-of-competition. If you are an ultrarunner and are interested in participating (I estimate it will take about 10-15 minutes), the link is below:

ultrarunning,likeakipper8,"Ran my first ultra. It sucked. My second is already booked for May. Should I cancel? (M, 34)","Had been training for my first ultra for nearly a year (training started in November, race was postponed in May and then cancelled, signed up for another which was Saturday) and ran a couple of days ago.

The course was hard as expected, 55k with 2500m of vertical ascent and similar descent, which I couldn't match in training where I live but I was able to get in around 650m of climbing in multiple training runs.

The first 25k was OK, I was able to run the flats and walk the hills as intended. After that my hips and then knees gave me shooting pains whenever I tried to go downhill at any pace, meaning I couldn't run downhill any more and essentially walked it in for the last 30k for a time of 10h40.

I was expecting my calves to give me trouble but with so little actual running my muscles were fine. Nutrition and hydration were also great, so I wasn't tired and was hardly out of breath. 

My May race has been rescheduled for 2021 so before I decide that my old man joints will ruin that race as well and pull out I wanted to ask some more experienced runners if there is anything I can do to strengthen my joints so they can keep up with the rest of my body?

I don't want a repeat of this slow hike when I felt like I could have run it in around 8 hours without the joint issues. Similarly I don't want to abandon and then feel like I could do the race justice later on. What can I do?

TL;DR: Ran my first ultra, joints stopped me running so is it something I can fix before May or should I abandon that idea?",1601880231
ultrarunning,fallsapart,"""Run"" Report - Bridger Ridge Sufferfest","**Link to the Photos:** [Bridger Ridge Run](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RuBJf9T2zLaF1GvM6)

**Details:**
North Cottonwood Trailhead to M Trailhead (and home)

26.84 Miles

8645ft Gain

9335ft Descent

**Run Narrative:**

The famous Bridger Ridge Run goes from the Fairy Lake trailhead in Bozeman, and ends at the ""M"" Trial just north of town for 19 tough and gorgeous miles.  But the road to Fairy Lake being so rough and times being what they are, I chose an easier trailhead to take off from rather than the official run - easier from the standpoint of the drive for my wife and kids, not for the run. I'm a climber/mountaineer turned trailrunner during COVID times.  I was a competitive runner and skier through high school and some of college, but climbing has been my main focus for more than 15 years.  But for the last 6 months, I've been really training in the mountains, and have logged hundreds of miles on the trail.

I started from the North Cottonwood trailhead at around 730am with temps hovering in the low 40s and crystal clear skies.  The run picks over some rocky terrain for about a half mile, and then immediately gains almost 1k on long, open switchbacks that are supremely runnable.  After that, I entered the woods along a creek for the next three or so miles, criss-crossing and picking my way through brush and rocks. 

At mile 4, the spectacular part of this run begins. The trail opens up onto the sub-alpine foothills, and trees become sparse and are replaced with open fields and stunning views of most of the ridge to come.  A month or so earlier, I had done this section of the run, and was literally running through waist high flowers.  Very Sound of Music.  

But this section of trail involves two small passes that tack on a ton of vertical - so when I hit the start of Sacajawea Peak (9667), I was at 8 miles and 4.5k of vert.  I stopped to snap some photos of some mountain goats, including a mom with her kid, and fuel up a little.  For those familiar with the traditional ridge run, usually you are at about 2 miles and 2k of vert gained, with 17 to go. And one you are up Sac, you are (mostly) on the ridge until you hit the M.

I crossed onto the sub-peak known as Naya-Nuki and found the cairn about a half mile later that marks the turn onto the ""bridger foothills"" trail.  This would be the only section of the route that I hadn't run this summer, and man - I was about to learn some lessons.

The foothills trail is insanely gorgeous - single track along a steep pitch that passes limestone buttresses, pine forest, and open hillsides that afford endless views.  But it drops a lot of elevation, all of which you have to make back up. 

When I hit Ross Pass, I was at a half-marathon and a vertical mile of elevation gain almost exactly.  And to regain the ridge, I had about another thousand feet of climbing through steep, technical terrain. For the first time in my running career, I bonked, and bonked hard.  It was a deep, existential bonk, that came out of nowhere and left me bewildered.  I kept checking my watch - only 13 miles?  The previous weekend, I had pretty casually run a trail marathon, and was feeling so mentally strong  and so fit.  And for about 4 miles, it was all I could do to keep moving forward. 

The section from Ross Pass to Bridger Bowl was brutal, but at the top of Bridger, I hit familiar terrain and new I was only 11 miles from home, with about 4k of descent and 3k more gain.  Knowing the terrain made it a little easier to break up the run mentally, as well as some choice texts of encouragement from friends.  I was definitely in the pain cave still, but at least I was moving.

The last section climbs Saddle Peak (9142), descends and cruises through Baldy (8914) and down trough the M.  The final section was hit by a wildfire that consumed more than 7000 acres and 26 homes, and this was the first time I'd seen it first hand.  A trail I've hiked and run countless times looked utterly foreign - it looks like a moonscape of dust and dr. Seuss trees.  

The run down was uneventful, other than trying to avoid hordes of college kids during our most recent Covid-wave on the way down.  The last two miles are on paved bike path, and I was happy to realize that I had ""run"" for the last 9 or so miles.  

**Takeaways**: I need to get more rest in between these bigger efforts if I want to really make them valuable runs.  This is a spectacular setting, and I was a little bummed to have brought less than my best form to it.  Nutrition felt okay, but I need to bring more food - I tend to bring next to nothing, and during a bonk that doesn't help.  But in retrospect, it was excellent mental training. I haven't had a day that was this difficult mentally in ages, and I think it is worth it just to put yourself there. I feel great today, and that's a little telling. I wasn't able to eat a ton yesterday, but have eaten like a Hobbit all day today and feel ready to run.  So, a good training, learning run, and a beautiful setting for some self-induced suffering.",1601866875

I was stunned by the negativity! Only a few gave some advices and what to be aware of, where the rest was all negativity. ""Get a refund"", ""you are stupid for during this"", ""you are definitely going to get injuried"". Even got DMs telling me im an idiot for during this!
I closed the threat, since nothing positive came out it.

Since I don't want my training to go to waste, I am going to run a 100K in my hometown. 3 loops of 21.7 miles. 900 feet of total elevation. I would rather hit the trails but the fires of last month have led to closure of trails, campgrounds and local forests. 

Here's my plan:

1. My place will be the start of every loop. 
2. I'll use it as ""base camp""/aid station. Food, toilet, change of clothes etc...
3. I'll do each loop in a ""washing machine"" pattern to workaround the boredom.
4. I plan to change my clothes for each loop. Shirts, shorts and socks. And apply body glide.
5. I plan to start early (pre-dawn) . 3am.
6. I don't want to think about target pace.  I just want to finish

ultrarunning,Spiritual-Seesaw,Critique my training plan for the Moab 50k,"I bit the bullet and signed up for the Arches 50k in Moab on January 30th as my first 50k. The race is 32.2 miles with 3k elevation gain between 4500-5500 total elevation. I've ran a few marathon training blocks and recently moved to Colorado. My goal is to finish and to finish well -- not trying to win any awards here. I'd love to come in sub 6 hours as my B goal and sub 5:30 as my A goal assuming everything goes well. 

We're 17 weeks out and I have a decent base and have started putting together a rough draft of my training plan. I put in 100 miles in September with a mix of road, hills, and high elevation trail running. 

The plan totals just under 700 miles with a mix of fartlek, middle distance hills/trail, easy, and long runs. Definitely a jump up from my previous blocks, so it will be a challenge, but it still feels attainable. In my last marathon block I maxed just under 50 MPW as well, but that was at sea level and mostly flat.

ultrarunning,Janalon,Nutrition advice for a self-supported 55mi ultra through the NJ pine barrens.,"At the last minute, the state department did not have the manpower to process the permit. It's far more of a ""this race is not approved"" rather than a ""the permits were rejected"" situation. The race director offered two options: defer or virtual run. My first thought was to defer and put my training toward another 50 miler... but all local trail races are in the same predicament at the moment. So I plan to run the 55 miler on the actual course, which is point-to-point.

There is a small, self-organized group of runners who plan to tackle this as a group support run. There are plans for stashed water and snacks along the route. That's all and well, but I'd rather plan for the worst, and hope for the best. I'm a little less worried about hydration, as there is a city water supply at miles 8 and 21. I'm running with the Salomon Adv 5- two 500ml flasks and a 1.5L bladder. I have experience running with this much water for 33 miles. I'm fairly certain the last water stop should be barely sufficient, and those extra water drops would be more than OK.

I'm more worried about nutrition along the route. I have trained with Larabars and gels and could pack enough to fuel once per hour. But I've never run a 55mi before... and I'm not certain if I should fuel more frequently. My Adv 5 is somewhat limited... especially considering that I will need to also carry a headlamp and lipstick size battery to recharge my watch. There might not be much more room for much more food. I know the ultralight hiking community has parsed out weight to calorie density. And I'm starting to wonder if I should start thinking along those lines to pack extra nutrition.

Again, I hope there are snacks along the route, but I need to prepare as if self-supported. I'm open to any advice you can provide! I don't want to DNF due to poor execution on race-day nutrition.",1601668778

ultrarunning,fallsapart,Winter Running Tight Recommendations (for truly cold running),"Hey everyone,

I'm in the market for some new running tights to replace 18 year old sugio tights.  I've got an REI gift card that I'd like to use up, so I'm hoping for a recommendation for something they have.

I live in Bozeman, and I run in weather well into the negatives.  I often run loops on forest service trails close-ish to my house, so there is frequently wind exposure on ridges.  

So far, I'm considering most the Arcteryx Trino SL pants, Patagonia Peak Mission or Wind Shield tights, or the craft essential winter tights. I'm leaning toward the Trinos, because it sounds like they have a little bit more temperature range to them, and the more ""pants"" like fit might mean on the really cold days I can put some cap beneath.

I feel pretty dialed in on managing the cold (been in Bozeman for a long time now) and backcountry ski and ice climb. I'm just looking for recs on new tights, as its been years since I've had to buy them.

So, this weekend I signed up for a last minute 50k. I've been training for a longer race that was recently cancelled and this race fit into my training schedule.

I figured I could just take it easy and it'd go away. A few miles of run/walk cycles kept it at bay but around the 13.5 mile mark, I went to switch from walking to running and my right calf seized up on the first step, effectively ending my race.

A humble, painful walk to the starting line ensued. I massaged for 10 minutes or so, but couldn't work it out enough to justify starting the second lap. It turned out to be the right call as it wasn't until the next morning that I could really use my right leg again.

I followed my standard nutrition/salt/water strategy that gets me through hotter, harder runs, so I don't think those were triggers. My feet were a little swollen from the humidity, which made my shoes a little tight, which is the only thing I can think of that may have triggered it.

Since failures are great opportunities to learn: what is the proper protocol to deal with calf cramps during a race?

Should I have stopped and sat down as soon as I noticed it? Should I have walked and avoid the running until it went away?

If you've worked through a bad cramp in a race, how'd you do it?",1600733700

ultrarunning,Goodie2noshoes,Hello all. How do you guys pick your shoes?,"I’ve been a minimal runner since the start of my running journey 4 years ago. I gradually built up my mileage throughout my time running. I run about 35-50km a week. 

    I’m finding towards the 40-50km mark my legs just seem to start breaking down and don’t feel great. Most of my runs are shorter (3.5-12km). Varies a little randomly throughout the week, then a long run around 15-22km. 

I’m starting to think I need something with some cushion, to be able to safely and successfully up my mileage. My end goal is to do something like a 70-80km race. I’ve tried a couple cushioned shoes that I didn’t really end up liking. I’ve tried the Altra lone peak 4s and some brooks pureflow 7.

I did try the brooks before I bought them in the store just doing some strides etc and they felt good but after taking them out several times they just felt kinda bad. 

Do you guys do the whole running gait test etc and then pick your shoes out from whatever they suggest? I’ve never had one done but I’ve read a lot of science that kinda says they’re bull so I’ve just avoided them and kinda just randomly picked my shoes kinda based off minimal shoe properties like wide toebox, low heel drop, low arch support. 

Right now I feel like I’m coming down with a case of runners knee. So I’m just lost of what to do now. Try another pair of traditional cushioned shoes or just take a break and heal up a bit and do some strength exercises.

While the most likely thing would have been that it got cancelled due to the Covid it actually got cancelled less than 24 hours before due to horrible wildfire smoke and air pollution conditions. It was tough pill to swallow. I had trained and tapered and then... nothing. On top of that no running for almost a week now due to the continued air quality. Almost to my breaking point I remembered I had access to a really good respirator/filters that would filter out all the bad stuff in the air. Wasn't sure how it would work out but I've done a 3 mile and 8 mile run over the last 2 days and while not the most enjoyable experience it was workable. Almost felt like training at altitude in a way. I took it really slow and ran by effort and felt good. No immediate bad affects other than a sore nose and man is that thing uncomfortable after awhile.

I also know that many have it much worse than me and have lost their homes or worse to the wildfires so this rant is by no means a way to belittle that. It's really just a crazy time out here.

I've been running 45mpw average for the last 9 months, with a 3-4 hour long run and a speed session each week.  70% of my running is on trails, usually can get between 3-5k vert on the week. The volume has felt great, injury free and still super exciting mentally.  I've had some different races cancelled and seem to finally be settled on what looks to be a more beginner-friendly 50 miler in November. This will be my first 50 miler -  I'm excited to see what I can do, hopefully finish, but not beat myself up over times, etc. 

I should be able to work up to 55-60mpw for some peak weeks, but because of a busy work schedule I won't have the ability to run back-to-back long runs.  Has anyone had success in a similar situation? I have seen they are highly recommended, but I know if I can make it happen, it will be a last minute schedule bonus. 

I'm really going to lean on the base I've got and the months of consistent volume - I similarly probably won't be able to put together any runs upwards of 25 miles beforehand.

ultrarunning,LordPoopturd,Race Report: Eden Valley Ultra Trail 50k,"### Race Information
* **Name:** Eden Valley 50k
* **Date:** September 12, 2020
* **Distance:** 50 kilometers
* **Location:** Kent, UK

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Finish in one piece | *Yes* |
| B | Sub 4:30 | *No* |

### Training
I've only been running seriously since December, although I ran track and XC when I was younger so it didn't take me long to establish a base.

I signed up for this race about seven weeks ago. I was running 35-40 mpw at the time. I gradually increased my mileage and peaked around 60 three weeks ago. The main thing I did differently was increase my long runs by a lot. I bumped them up from 2 hours to 3+ hours, and most weekends I would do back-to-back long runs (although the second long run was rarely more than 2 hours). My last few back-to-backs totaled more than 50k, and my final back-to-back session totaled just under 40 miles. After that, I tapered well and I felt fresh by race day.

However, I made the mistake that a lot of trail noobs make. I didn't spend nearly enough time training on the type of terrain that I would race on.

### Pre-race
The race was held in a beautiful area in the English countryside, and the weather was perfect. Being in a big field in the middle of the woods, it was very easy to follow social distancing rules. They also had us line up in separate groups based on estimated finish times, and they staggered the starts one-by-one, with several seconds between each person and 10 minutes in between each big group.

### Race
I went out with the lead group. I started the race feeling very overconfident. But luckily it didn't take me long to realize that I was going out too fast, so after the first couple of miles I let the group get away from me and settled into my own pace. I ran more or less on my own for the first 18-20k. I passed through the first aid station feeling great. At one point I made a wrong turn, but something felt off so I took out my phone and checked the GPX file of the course and found my way back.

A group of runners caught up to me somewhere around 18-20k and we ran together for a while. I was still feeling great, but the bumps and hills and rugged terrain were starting to get to me. I wasn't tired but my quads began feeling heavy, which never happened in training. Around 25k, we got to a series of very steep hills. All of us walked up them rather than try to tough it out and tire out our legs. But we ran down all the steep downhill sections, and those likely burned out my quads just as much.

This group of runners got away from me at the second aid station. After refueling there, I ran on my own for a little while and soon caught up to a few people from the group who had fallen back. Around this point I noticed the weather getting hotter. I stayed with them for a few miles, but when we were running through a flat section through some wide open farmland, the heat started getting to me so I slowed down and let them go. At this point, I started feeling the dreaded ""bonk"" creeping up on me. I started hydrating and eating more frequently, trying to stave off the inevitable bonk for as long as I could.

Eventually I jogged in to the third and final aid station. At this point I was feeling destroyed. I was really unwell. I sat down in a chair and genuinely thought I was done. My body did not want to move any more. I stayed at that aid station for probably 10 minutes. I drank some coke and ate some salty chips (sorry, ""crisps""). Eventually I got up and tried to get moving again, but I literally couldn't run for more than a minute or so. My body just wouldn't do it. I had bonked spectacularly.

There were 7 miles between the last aid station and the finish. I walked the first one, maybe two. I was in a bad, bad state. But after a little while, my state improved a bit. I still felt terrible, but I was able to start jogging at a slow pace again. I passed through a town with about 4 miles to go, and actually started feeling good enough to run at a pace that felt somewhat normal. I'm not sure if this qualifies as ""coming back"" from a bonk, because I still felt like death, but I did come back from the bonk in the sense that I was able to settle back into some semblance of a run.

I still had to stop and walk a few times in those last few miles any time there was a hill. But for the most part, I ran it in. I must have been running way slower than I thought though, just based on how long those last 4 miles took. At this point I was feeling delirious, but when I came across an area that I recognized from the beginning of the race, I knew there was less than a mile left so I just booked it as fast as I could. I finished the race in 6 hours.

### Nutrition/Hydration
I brought my favorite long-run snacks with me, apricots and granola bars. At the aid stations, I would eat either chips (""crisps"") or bananas. I didn't have any stomach issues. I should have eaten a bit more, but I think I did okay in terms of taking in calories. Hydration was the bigger issue for me. I felt like I was drinking plenty of water, but something must have been off. I was drinking water mixed with ""Zero"" electrolyte tablets. Zero is really not the best brand; I normally stick with Nuun but I ran out of Nuuns and forgot to buy more.

Aside from the trails killing my leg muscles too early in the race, dehydration was probably the main factor in my bonk. I literally didn't have to pee all day despite drinking plenty. Also, my tongue went numb (?!) in the last few miles of the race. It was a bit scary.

### Post-race
The organizers did an amazing job putting this race together. It was a great event and the whole thing went smoothly.

This was very humbling for me; I knew that trail racing was different but I didn't realize just how different it was. I'm aware that I didn't spend a very long time training for this, so I'm just happy to have completed it and to be able to say that I've done an ultramarathon.

I've got a marathon coming up in November on a 100% flat, level course. After that I plan to focus on speed and improving my 5k/10k times. So it will probably be quite a while before I do another trail ultra, and I doubt I'd ever do more than two or three of these a year. But, having said that, I will definitely be back for more. This race was as fun as it was painful, and it's made an ultramarathon fan out of me.

Both sexes improved body composition, but because I was cuducting testing on a stationary bike (Calibrated ergo) body mass wasn't restricting performance like with running.

Hi everyone! I follow you all but haven't been very vocal because I have yet to finish my first ultra. I was ready for my 50k in April, but we all know what went down that put the kibosh on that. Then I was too depressed to run for a few months, but I'm BACK! I deferred with the same race company locally and they are doing a timed ultra in October, so I am signed up for the 12-hour. I'm pumped, and feel pretty good about my training, the time I have left, etc. 

What I would love advice on is in regards to crewing for a friend next weekend. She and I were training for the same 50k in a training group, but she had a 50-mile race scheduled for this month that had to cancel. It's a much bigger race than the little local trail races we do, so we understood why they were canceling, but she has been working so hard to train that I told her we should do it anyway. I said I could coordinate a 50 mile run and crew for her while pacing the last 20-25 miles as a training run for me. I put together the aid station plan, a GPX file of the course, we've trained on part of the course, and she has family members coming along to crew, too. 

As ""the details person"" in all of this, I am making sure to bring extras of everything I would want on a long run: lubricant, clothing, snacks, water, hydration mix, the basics. I'll also have road atlases for my car and the other car in case GPS fails. I want to pack a first aid kit, but I'm not sure what the best things would be to put in there since I've never run more than a marathon and never had much trouble with serious blisters or anything. The weather should be 50-60s and we'll be running long enough to need light, so I'll bring extra headlamps and batteries. 

I'm open to any and all suggestions and I really appreciate how willing everyone is to help here! Thank you—",1599836397
ultrarunning,trail-pact,Should I go for a 50k at the end of January?,"Fitness background:

Used to run casually (1-2 miles every other day) to supplement rock climbing and weight training. I was introduced to racing about a year ago and started to get more into it. 

• Last May I ran my first HM (~2Hr finish time)
• Since then I’ve probably ran HM distance 5 times
• Finished the GVRAT 1000k this summer (averaging over 5 miles per day). Although this was including ~15 walking miles per week
• Most recently I worked up to averaging 30-35 MPW for a few weeks 
• Longest distance run was last month of 16 miles. That was also my longest run duration of 3 hours 13 min. 
• Hardest/longest hikes I’ve done are 2 14ers in CO 

After the GVRAT I took some time off to help a lingering IT flare up. Just started a base plan starting at 18-22 MPW. Legs are feeling fine so far. 

At the end of January there’s an awesome looking race that has both 30k/50k options. Debating either very slowly building base back up and going for the 30k/looking for a 50k maybe next spring or fall OR hop into a 16 week plan at the end of the month to shoot for the 50k.

As I’ve gotten more into the lifestyle and see the tremendous benefits it has had on me physically, mentally, and emotionally, I’ve decided I want to get into ultras. More specifically, I’ll be moving to Colorado in a few months and I have my eyes set on Leadville. That said, I’m hoping to pick up any pieces of advice for the following questions:

* Is the Leadville 100 a realistic goal for the summer of 2021? 2022?
* What kind of goals should I be setting each month? Trying to add 5, 10 miles per month to my max run? Is this even the correct approach?
* How often do you push yourself to your max distance (every run, once a week, once a month)?
* What’s a realistic timeframe for stretching my max of 12 miles to a marathon? From marathon to say, 35 miles, 45 etc.
* I've often seen that you shouldn't run the distance of a race until race day. This sounds bogus, I don't need to feel like I accomplished it for the first time, I just want to accomplish it at Leadville when the time comes. Any thoughts?
* Any running/training advice you would give to a friend?

I’m looking for very practical advice, so I’ll try to be specific about myself: I’m 6-foot even and 162 lbs. I’m a freelance writer with the ability to give myself lots of free time and I’m very driven when it comes to training, so I could make a pretty rigorous training routine work and stick to it over long periods of time. I’ve been an athlete all of my life and have rarely ever gotten injured in competition or practice. When I currently run and feel like giving up, it’s got everything to do with feeling like I’m not getting enough oxygen and my body almost feels like it’s capable of continuing. 

If I sound very naive, it’s because I am. If it is outright ridiculous to target Leadville in 2021, please expose my idiocy. I cannot find consistent info on these sorts of questions.",1599601332

According to their website, if you cancel within the last 30 days before the race then you get no refund, and I think that makes total sense, but if you have to pull out earlier than that 30 days, they will roll over half of what you paid to the same event the following year.

I’m due to be running a 50 miler at the end of February. I’ve run a very hilly 50k before and when not training run about 25 miles per week over 3 days. 

My issue is I think I’m going to struggle getting in more than 3 days of running per week. I can probably push it to 4 days per week during bigger mileage weeks but I think most weeks especially in the early stages will likely have to be done over 3 days. 

My question is is it possible to train properly for the 50 miler over mainly 3-4 days per week? 

I should mention that the 50miler is much flatter than the 50k I did. I’m very much a middle of the pack runner and I’m not bothered about absolutely smashing it, I just want to be able to finish without injuring myself to be honest.

This seems foolhardy. It is a bad example. It feels disrespectful to the sport. I think mostly though, it is going to encourage people with little training to make poor decisions that will land them in over their heads.

The second half had consistent rolling hills, which were way tougher than I anticipated, and I finished a few minutes short of my target, but well ahead of the old record.

But here's the good bit: I got home and went to upload my time for verification, only to find that the British 100km champion had gone out the same weekend and run the same route two hours faster than me.

ultrarunning,orestmercator,"""Race"" report: supposed to run 31 miles, instead ran 47.","New to ""ultra""running, so just wanted to start off by saying thanks to everyone for the great information on this board, the encouragement and thanks to those who told me to ""trust my training."" Apparently the Relentless Forward Progress 70 MPW 50k plan is enough to prepare you for 50 miles.  


Strava activity: [https://www.strava.com/activities/3918653000](https://www.strava.com/activities/3918653000)

Had a 50k trail run fall through so decided to do a local run by myself. The trail run had 6k ft of climbing so I had planned to run as far as I could to try and make up for the challenge. My goals were:

1. Run from my front door to Oceanside Harbor. \~45ish miles.

2. Run further than 34 miles

3. Run 34 miles

4. Run 31 miles

Woke up at 4am and hit the road. I fought some nausea for the first 30 miles, which was unusual for me. My g/f met me along the way every 5-6 miles so I requested a baked potato for the nausea. No idea why... I didn't eat potatoes in training, but when I was fueling and thinking about the nausea it was like my body spoke up and said, ""Hey, I know exactly what you need. You should get a potato for this stomach ache."" And I'll be damned it if worked. At some starchy, flavorless potato at mile 31 and it practically fixed everything (combined with an occasional ginger chew). 

It was hot and humid (watch read 97 degrees at one point) so aside from the potato, the only thing I felt like eating was stroop waffels and tailwind, so I was sucking down 200 cal of tailwind every hour and forcing myself to take bites of stroop waffels at regular intervals. Thanks to everyone who suggested liquid calories for hot or high altitude efforts. Also, ice wrapped in a bandana around your neck is clutch. My heart rate was under control the whole time and I think it was largely due to always having ice on my neck and head.

Anyway, I got to 31 miles, body felt pretty good aside from the slight nausea so I decided to keep going to 34. Same story at 34, body still felt good, so I just kept going. And once I was past 34 miles, chasing down the miles felt relatively easy. I suffered for sure - the heat sucked and standing still for too long made me feel kinda dizzy - but I never felt like quitting. After hitting 34, every extra mile was icing on the cake until I made it to Oceanside Harbor for 47.03 miles.

I did an 8/3 run/walk strategy and it worked very, very well. In hindsight I could have pushed the pace, but this being my first ultra I just wanted to make sure I was going to hit my goals. Prior to this my longest effort was 27 miles in training. It's been a week since the run and my legs feel completely recovered. My upper lungs and throat are kind of sensitive and I have a mild cough, so I'm going to take a few more days off, but overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to do another one. Thinking of doing the Avalon 50 in January. I'm also interested in last man standing events and 24 hours races... kind of toying with the idea of running a 10k loop around my house for 24 hours. I think I'll also make a tradition out of this run, a HWY 101 50 miler from DT San Diego to Oceanside. Next time I'll change up the course slightly to grab those extra 3 miles and make it a proper 50.

Thanks again, all. Hope your training is going well.",1598282816
ultrarunning,PokkeFlokke,Running ultras in 2021?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a while now, soaking up all your advice, tips and tricks (for which thanks!). 

I’m a pretty new runner from the very flat Belgium, looking to start training for my first ultramarathon(s) in 2021. Some background: I started running when lockdown hit us in the beginning of March, and have gradually built up to running 4 times a week for 30-40K a week, longest runs so far are around 15-16K. I signed up for my first trails races in September (13K, 660D+), Oktober (17K, 220 D+) and November (15K, 360D+).

I’ve been thinking of starting to build up towards longer distances, and have set my sights on a 55K, 2060D+ trail race in Belgium near the end of March in 2021 (Crêtes de Spa if anyone has experience there?). However, this would be the buildup towards the Stelvio ultra trail in Northern Italy in the beginning of July, coming in at 79.9K, 5730D+. 

My questions to you are as follows:
1. Is this reasonable considering my current base + with the time available? If yes, any advice before I set out on this journey? If no, other recommendations or ideas about what my base should be before?
2. Has anyone here run the Stelvio ultra? How is it? Any advice preparing?

I have a few questions, and also looking for general advice. 

1. Would you start in the evening and walk through the night first or walk through the day first?
2. What food would you eat? How much water? Everything we eat will need to be in our backpacks.
3. Would you suggest breaks or try and keep moving? We were thinking about sitting down and having a proper ""meal"" at the half way mark before we turned back?
4. I'm thinking about wearing hiking boots rather than my running trainers, I think my partner will want to walk more than run. Opinions?
5. Any specific training? I am running a marathon about a month before I plan to walk the 100km, so tips to move from marathon training to walking training in that month?
6. Any other tips!

ultrarunning,Scrubfire,I did my first 100k yesterday,"All my races were cancelled this year, including my first over 50k race, 88k at the Capes 100 in Nova Scotia. Since my training was already ramping up, I decided to keep going and make my own race locally.

I create a course around Fredericton, NB that would visit four different trails (one of them twice) where I would do 12k on each. I would run in the road to each trail head, so it was 60 on trail, 40k on road, with over 1300m elevation.

I started at 3:50 am. I changed shoes at each transition from road to trail to road. I planned on only 5 minutes for transitions, with 3 15 minute transitions for eating.

I finished in 18:35:35.

What went well:

My training up to the race was my best ramp up ever. I attribute it to listening to my body, and slowing down when I had to.

The people who supported me in the race were amazing. From moving my gear bin from place to place, to accompanying me during the race. I only ran for 3k alone. That would never happen in an organized race, it made all the difference in the world.

The weather cooperated. We had 35c+ weather for weeks before the race. On race day the weather broke and it was 24c

What didn't go well:

About 35k in my right IT band started pinching. It reduced my running to 5 min at a time, and eventually reduced me to hiking the rest of the way.

Chafing in places I didn't expect. I kept a cliff bar in my front right pocket. The pocket hung just below my spandex underwear. I have a wonderful 3 inch gash where the cliff bar package swung back and forth.

Damn poles kept snagging, eventually bending one.

A bit of a mix up with my gear bin left me waiting for 30 min at one point.

Someone decided that my Gatorade in my bin needed ice to cool down. Everything got wet including electronics, spare clothing, TP. /sigh

Body went into shock when I got home. Solved it with a warm bath and hot tea.

In conclusion:

What a day. I definitely need to find tune my training for next year, but I'm feeling much more confident about reaching my goal of running a 160k

I also feel that I have a pretty efficient and light running gate compared to most, but I suppose I can’t rule that out.

After 10 miles in the mountains felt great in the morning, I decided to go for another short run in the afternoon. One lap around the lake felt so good that I decided to run down to the ocean, pretty soon I'd run all the way across town and back and totaled 36 miles for the day, just my second time wearing them. My legs felt better than they ever have before. I know they're not for everyone, but I was so smitten by them that I wrote this love letter to my new shoes. I only hope that there are other people out there that can understand the depths of my emotion. If you've never tried a pair of Altras, holy shit, try them. I have no affiliation with the company, but if you do, message me and I will happily accept free Altra running shoes in exchange for love letters of this nature. I already have two more pairs in the mail as I write this.  


My dearest Altras, 

It makes me sad to know I’ve waited so long to find you. When I’m with you, I feel like I can do anything, like I can fly, like I could run a hundred miles. For so long I’ve smashed my feet into padded, pointy shoes with raised heels and endured little pains in every part of my legs. I always made excuses and tried to fix my running form, thinking all of our problems were my fault. Certainly, I had things to work on, but never once did I ask myself if the shoes I was with were right for me. Never once did I consider if 10mm of drop brought out the best in me, or if boost foam was actually just padding a problem I needed to face head-on in order to find out what I was truly capable of. I had grown dependent on a false image of footwear that our culture has perpetuated, until almost every shoe you meet seems to be nothing but empty promises of more cushion, more support, more strength, more power, more popularity. We’ve let the media dictate what our feet are supposed to feel for so long, that we’ve forgotten that running is what we evolved to do. We’re perfect just the way we are.

With you, Altras, I can feel my legs working the way they were designed to, I feel like I can really be myself. On our first long run together, we PR’d our times on all distances from 1K all the way to 26.2! For the first time ever, I now know what it’s like to be with a shoe that pushes me to new heights, and makes me feel good in the long run, rather than breaking me down, and making me feel stiff and sore. Although it’s taken us so long to find one another Altra, I promise to make the most of the rest of our years together. I’ll never take proper foot strikes or correct glute activation for granted ever again.

I never thought I’d find the right shoes for me Altra, but I was wrong, I just had to keep looking and finally, I found you. I’m sure we’ll face our fair share of challenges. There will be rocky places along the trail. But no matter the mileage, no matter the depth of the bonk, no matter the unending elevation gains, I know you’ll always be there for me. I never want to take another step through this crazy life without you Altra. Please don’t ever go out of business. I don’t know what I would do without you. 

Forever yours,",1597291372

ultrarunning,BoatsBooksBudsBeers,Rower turned Runner Going from a 50 Miler to a 100K,"Hey Team!
I'm pretty new to the whole ultra game. I'm a rower who started running a lot back in April when I realized that my summer and fall seasons were basically shot due to COVID. It quickly escalated from casual 15 miles runs to a 28 miler (~8:56 pace) in May, a couple marathons and half marathons in June, a 50K in July(9:36 pace), and a 50 Miler on August 01st (pictured). 
I'm hoping to run a self-supported 100K in late October or early November, and I have a couple of questions for anyone who's got a bit more know how.
1) Food. I ate some clif gels and and nibbled on an RX bar during the 50 Miler, but I bonked really hard around mile 32, and the last 18 miles were way less fun. I know everyone is different, but I'm curious about when and what I should munch on. I have a hydrovest with a 1.5 liter bladder that I refilled a few times, so I felt like I handled hydration well. 
2) Blisters. My left foot got real fucked up. The nail bed of my left pinky toe died and the nail just kind of fell off yesterday, over a week after the fact. The outside of the big toe is 80% callous now, too. My right foot is totally unscathed though. Is that more likely a gait thing, or is it possible my feet are a slightly different size, causing one to experience extra friction? Should I have changed socks at some point? 
3) Shoes. I have two pairs of Altra Escalante 2s. I switched to the newer pair around Mile 32, but I'm not totally sure if this actually did anything.
4) Training. I'm still rowing about four times a week. My weekly milage is usually between 80 and 100 miles. I'd roughly estimate the breakdown at about 40% running, 40% rowing, and 20% cycling. Most of it slow steady state work. Thoughts on that? Should I bump my milage? Work in more work at AT? I do lots of yoga, too.

I'm 5 weeks out from a trail 50k where trail shoes are required, so I purchased a pair of Saucony Peregrines from my local running shop. The guy there told me they had an 8mm drop, but now looking online I can see that the drop is actually 4mm.

I gave the Peregrine's a short test run and didn't notice the difference, but I imagine that the feeling slowly creeps up over the course of a longer run. 

Going from 10mm to 4mm seems like a *huge* jump. But I've never tried a lower heel drop, so I don't know if it's actually that bad. Should I bother taking these back, or should I just suck it up and make the switch?

ultrarunning,angrrybird,Thoughts on Training Essentials for Ultrarunning book by Jason Koop,"A while ago I asked for recommendations for a book on ultrarunning. I was referred to Training Essentials for Ultrarunning by coach Jason Koop. I've now read his book and some things there seem to go against the lore. Jason states that one should do the least specific aspects of training the furthest away from the event. He has his athletes start with an interval training block at the beginning of the season, followed by a lactate threshold training block and finally - an endurance block.

I came across the term Aerobic Deficiency Syndrome (ADS) in another book called Training for the Uphill Athlete by Steve House, Scott Johnston and Killian Jornet ([https://www.uphillathlete.com/aerobic-deficiency-syndrome/](https://www.uphillathlete.com/aerobic-deficiency-syndrome/)).

ultrarunning,mountainfiend48,Had to be picked out of the Alabama Wilderness via helicopter. Need advice.,"To preface, I am (or was) training for the Pinhoti 100 coming up in November. I’ve been doing steadily building weeks, based on time, since March. I started at about 3 hours a week and have built up to 6-8 hour weeks. With that in mind, over this summer I have been doing between 10-18 mile long runs which equates to 2.5 - 5 hour long runs. Last weekend I went out to do an 18 mile loop on part of the course and had a pretty good day for the first 12-13 miles. I started in the dark at about 4:50am and made the harder parts of the trail while it was still cool. At mile 10 I stopped and refilled my water (I was carrying two 500ml bottles and a large smart water bottle to use with my sawyer filter. I refilled a few times and probably drank around 5L the whole day.) After refilling I actually decided to go for a swim and cool off in the water. Then I took off on the last 8 miles. A little over halfway my body seemed to give out on me. I got lightheaded and decided to sit instead of risking passing out. Once I sat I started having full body cramps and vomiting most of what I had eaten/drank the last few hours. I was incapable of going any further under my own power even though I was only 3.5 miles from my car. I called 911 and due to how rural it was and the abilities of the mostly volunteer fire departments responding, it took about 4.5 hours for them to locate me on foot. My fiancé actually drove 1.75 hours and found me first. They couldn’t carry me out the trail so they chose a helicopter to remove me. Ended in an overnight in the hospital, 5L IV fluid and mild case of rhabdo. 

I know these questions will come so I will answer them. 

Did I do anything differently? - only difference was I ate some crackers and a banana before. I usually run fasted. 

Did I take electrolytes? - yes. I used one of my 500ml bottles to concentrate 6 serving of tailwind. 

Did I eat on the trail? - yes. Honey stinger gummy’s and honey stinger waffles. 

Firstly I feel guilty for causing the whole scenario. Secondly I ran the same distance and elevation a few weeks prior and had no issues to speak of. Thirdly, am I the only one that has done this? I feel pretty silly for putting myself in such a situation. Lastly, what could I have done better to avoid this in the future?

ultrarunning,Casper_Mac,Hit my first Ultra (50k) distance in training yesterday... by running round some very small fields,"In the training leading up to my 2-Day Hadrian's Wall Ultra coming up I hit a big milestone yesterday when I hit my first ultra distance! [Strava](https://imgur.com/a/Pfp15Ge) 

My pre-run prep (or lack thereof) certainly left much to be desired. I had some old friends visiting from out of country and spent the Friday and Saturday beforehand with them and some others catching up and celebrating. This included some ill-advised tequila on Friday and a very large/rich dinner on the Saturday.

Due to some other logistical issues I also ended up having to run outside the small town where a good friend (who acted as my support crew and came down to resupply water, etc) lives. My route consisted of two little loops round the fields outside the town which I ran in a figure of 8. The total distance for each double loop... under 4 miles. 

My longest runs before this have all been in the 3.5ish hour range so the extra two hours on my feet was **incredibly** noticeable. Thankfully most of my old training niggles (top of foot tendons/ankles) did not cause grief but I suffered with pain on the soles of my feet for the first time. Combined with my first instance of getting a very tight/cramped stomach which made taking on nutrition and fluid very difficult. I found myself pretty deep in the pain cave for a solid 7-8 mile section.

A new route across some idyllic English fields overlooking the village was very pleasant for about the first hour or so but must admit the psychological toll of passing the same start/finish point so often was starting to leave it's mark as well. My friend ran the last loop with me and can honestly say I think that's what actually got me across the line. 

Looking back I feel the stomach issues were fairly obviously self inflicted (tequila and large rich dinners will no longer be consumed in the vicinity of any Ultras) but aside from that feel there's been some significant lessons learnt. Getting out for that length of time running I feel was crucial and I feel I've come away stronger in the mental department as well.

Plodding round the same small fields for 5 and a half hours by myself wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first ultra. But it turns out running 31 miles is an adventure one way or another wherever and however you do it.

ultrarunning,guccipow,first 50k?,"well, I'm deciding to sign up for a 50k very close to where I am going to school this fall. 21m and have been running with the intent of having a Cross Country season this fall, but sadly that is out the window due to COVID. Currently logging in \~70 mpw and just yesterday decided that I want to take a shot at a longer distanced race. My longest run to date is 18 miles and I will have exactly 3 months/12 weeks to train as of yesterday. Should I consider hiring a coach, or just keep logging in miles similar to what I am doing now, but with an emphasis on longer runs on the weekend?

\### Training  
I hired a coach in January to help me prepare for my first 50-mile in April and 100-mile in June. The 50-mile was cancelled, and thankfully, the 100-mile was postponed to October due to Covid (because that was a very aggressive goal). I was running 3-5 days a week; prior to all of the gym facilities being closed I was also swimming 1-2 times per week and I do CrossFit 3-5 days/week. After gym closures, I started to bike once a week instead of swim, but I wasn't as consistent. I still did CrossFit style workouts with my limited equipment at home, and I was extremely diligent in doing all of my programmed runs. Around mid-June I dropped to CrossFit \~2-3 times per week, and by mid-July 1-2/week. I did my last CrossFit/strength workout on July 9. My longest run was just under six hours on June 20.   


\### Race strategy  
Don't start too fast, walk all the hills, don't stop too often.   


\### Pre-race  
I ate really well in the week leading up to the run. The night before I had sweet potato, chicken, and salad. I slept well, about 8 hours, and got up around 5 am to start my day. First was to make a pot of coffee as much to help me with a pre-run poop as for the caffeine. I ate way more for breakfast than I had planned, but as I was getting everything ready, I just kept grazing as felt good. This included .25 cup oatmeal with protein powder, pancakes with peanut butter and syrup, and eggs with chicken sausage and guacamole. I showed up about 30 minutes early, and started my warm-up. Two friends showed up before I started to run with me.   


\### Miles \[0\] to \[17\]  
Linda (my mom), Todd, Ben, and I set out at 8:05 am (60 degrees.) I didn't have a route planned; I was running on familiar trails so I was just going to go out and run until I felt I needed to get back to my aid station (husband parked with my mom's pop-up camper). My mom came with the goal of running the furthest distance she had ever gone (17 miles), and we decided it was best for her to not have an option to quit, so I just kept running south until I felt I needed to get back for some chicken noodle soup (perfect race food, IMO). Ben ran with us for about 8-9 miles before he had to head out to go fishing. I should mention, Ben is in his 70s, and I met him because he was a Friday night regular at a brewery I used to work at. Total legend. This section was great, and the chicken noodle soup with potato chips were delicious. Linda was at 14 miles (when we run together, I usually run ahead and then turn around and run back to her at turns or trail crossing, which adds up to my 3 extra miles) and she decided if she was going to run 17 miles, she may as well run 20.   


\### Miles \[17\] to \[26\]  
Our buddy Brian was awaiting us when we arrived for aid, and less than 10 minutes after heading out with him he asked, ""Should we head up Tessa's?"" I'm not sure what I was thinking, because Tessa's trail is about a 19% grade, I still had 8 hours to run, and Linda never trains on hills (she doesn't train on trail either, did I mention my mom is a total badass?!), but I said, ""Sure."" We immediately took a wrong turn, and I should have just headed back to the nice, gentle access road, but no, we continued up, up, up (I heard complaints from Linda that she was NOT a goat), and we were rewarded with a stellar view of Mt. Rainier for our efforts. This was the highest elevation in the park, and exposed, I was definitely feeling the heat (70ish degrees- I'm a Washingtonian though-and-through). We stopped for a quick photo-op and headed back toward the forest. We continued on, passing several mountain-bikers, and I heard a scream and a woop from about 100 yards behind me. I did our normal dance, and ran back to my mom, who had just reached her 17 mile mark! She said to me at that moment, ""If I can run 20, I can run a marathon..."" I had my one and only fall during mile 24, in which I landed very nicely in a bed of ferns and soft pine needles. We got back to the aid station around mile 26, Linda was at 19.6  


\### Miles \[26\] to \[39\]  
Brian had to leave us and Linda was ready to part ways. Matthew had showed up to run with Todd and   
I, and my mom's friend Michelle was there to see her. A couple of friends had stopped by to add their support (these people are all so great, it meant so much to see everyone who stopped by, even if I only saw them for a few minutes!)  We set out with Matthew, and it was great to have another pair of fresh legs running with us. We made another aid station stop at mile 35.5; my husband (Ian) was under rules to limit my stops to 7 minutes (that didn't happen often, but he tried!) so when I complained that my soup was too hot to eat he rushed me off and told me to do a short loop. We ran about a 5k, then I stopped again to eat my soup and very quickly got back on the trail. Matt had to leave us, but Gabe &amp; Heidi had arrived and we had yet another set of fresh legs (and minds). At this point, I was starting to feel tired, so I asked Todd if he was okay with doing shorter loops. If you know Todd, he's one of the most agreeable people, and we started on the short loops. 

\### Miles \[39\] to \[42\]  
I chatted with Heidi on this loop, and it was the perfect distraction from the niggles I was starting to feel. They ran just over 3 miles with us, bringing us into Hour 10, which is when Ian (my husband) would be joining Todd and I. The amazing Chris Hammet, owner of [Poulsbo Running](https://www.poulsborunning.com/), joined us at this point as well.   


\### Miles \[42\] to \[50.6\]  
I honestly don't remember much from this part of the run. This was hours 10-12, and I knew it would be important to have Ian with me. I was in my head a lot, telling myself to pick up my feet and just keep moving. Ian talked to me some, but mostly was running just behind me to keep me at a steady pace. What I do remember is not trusting myself enough to run the trails (too many roots and stumps) so we stuck to access roads. Also, I recall having a thought of, ""Is this what a Flow State feels like?"" just about the time I realized I was in the final half-hour of the run. Mile 50 was my fastest mile of the 12-hours (10:21) and the final 0.6 I ran at an 8:23 pace. I knew I had left Todd behind at this point, but I didn't think he would mind (he didn't). My 2-year-old was there to see me finish (and wouldn't even give his mom a kiss). I learned that Linda did indeed run a trail marathon (way to steal the show mom!) We ate chicken noodle soup and bacon, and shared a porter and a shot of Buffalo Trace before we started to pack up everything to head home.   


\### Post-race  
I definitely sat down and cried while I tried to change my clothes. I wish I had written this race report sooner (within a day or two) so things were more clear in my head. I also had written some notes at aid stops, but I have no idea where they ended up. My coach advised me to have a treat every hour, which I wish I had done! That evening I had an alarm go off every 2 hours to get up and stretch, because the stiffness I experienced after running a 50k was not something I wanted to experience again. It really did help, and other than some knee pain, my body did not feel too bad. I went to my chiro/PT on Monday and I told her that if someone told me I needed to run, I could. I followed that with a massage on Tuesday, and felt pretty good to set off for a road trip on Wednesday. I did my first post-race run after 6 days (20-ish minutes).   


\### Nutrition  
I took in about 3000 calories during the run (probably more, but I tried to track it all). This was Spring Nutrition, Endurance Tap, Kettle Chips, the best chicken noodle soup, guacamole, gummy bears, Tailwind, dried cherries, turkey, and protein powder.

ultrarunning,kurt206,Advice on tapering,"Hi - I'm running my first ultra in September - 60km (Fox ultra in the UK). I'm fairly happy with my prep - I'm running 30-40km every other weekend with back to backs in between. (although.... OUCH!)

I was wondering what tapering should look like before the big day? How long, how much - that kind of thing.

I know it sounds weird, but reducing mileage worries me lol.",1596393035
ultrarunning,althistorysports,Tracking your ultras,"What do you use to track your ultras when a watch doesn’t have the batter life? 

I’m planning in doing the 7 Continents virtual series which has, in addition to some regular marathons, a 60km, 80km, 100km and 160km ultras. 

I feel like my watch (Polar Vantage V) will track the 60km ok, maybe be ok for the 80km but I doubt it’ll do the 100km and definitely won’t do the 160km. 

Because it’s virtual though, I want to be able to know where I’m up to distance wise without having to get out the phone.",1596369942
ultrarunning,LordPoopturd,Longest run before your first 50k?,"I've trained for conventional races for a little while, so I've done plenty of weekly 2-hour long runs in the past (let's say roughly 15 miles).

I'm 6 weeks out from my first 50k, and 2 hours is still the longest I've ever gone. I'm pretty comfortable with those runs, and I plan to bump up the distance in the next few weeks so that I hit 3 hours (at least 21 miles) two weeks out from the race, and then taper.

Is this a good plan? Because I've read other posts saying it's better to increase the frequency of ~2 hour runs rather than focusing on longer ""single-glory"" runs, so I'm kind of questioning my plan.

Obviously I can't hope to make massive gains in fitness in 6 weeks, and I'm going into this race a bit under-trained, but ideally I can still give myself a little exposure to these longer distances before race day. This will also be my first time ever practicing fueling during runs (I never bothered with fueling during my 2-hour runs before).",1596365219
ultrarunning,mindyourbutthead,so confused about running shoe size. halp,"I (23f) have recently gotten into extending trail distances past 50km so i guess i'm into ultra running now. i've been running an average of 50km a week for years (and now these occassional super long distances) in 20$ discount nikes i bought years ago. i know its bad.

as a tree planter working in the bush i tried buying expensive hikers and they always hurt my feet. i think my feet swell alot when i'm putting this many km on them in a day. so i have always opted for crappier mesh ish shoes that are at least .5 of a size or 1 size up to manage my foot swelling, but they never felt exactly ""right"", and i've tried basically every brand and make of hiker probably totalling 3000$ or more over my planting career

fast forward to now and i'm scared to buy a nice trail runner. this is so embarassing but i've already bought and returned 3 pairs from our tiny shoe store in town because once i wore them around the house a bit i realized they were a bit too tight/way too loose if i go a half size up/whatever. i'm picky and scared to wear the shoe outside and realize i've wasted 150$+. i also live in a tiny tiny mountain town with a couple thousand people and am 5 hours from the nearest place with a big shoe store/shoe salesperson that knows anything about them

recently i went to a slightly larger town nearby with a little shoe store. i found these shoes that i love the fit of called the brooks cascadia. kinda a thin bottom, not stiff, fits like a cheap gym shoe but nicer and has great grip. now i'm realizing that the shoe is much longer than it should be, maybe? i obviously havent ran outside in them and dont plan on it until i figure this out. i'd like to do a 100km mountain run as soon as i get some damn shoes i'm sure about. so basically my question is do you guys use bigger shoes for 50-100km runs to compensate for foot swelling or do you wear the same shoes that you'd wear on a daily 10-15k?

TLDR; sensitive swelling feet. picky shoe girl. do you go a size up for shoes you run ultra in vs regular daily runner?",1596314700
ultrarunning,I_might_be_a_goat,Best start time for 24hr race,"I am running a solo 100 mile ultra marathon later this month. I plan and expect it to take 24 hours or thereabouts. I'm able to start at whatever time I want which is nice. I'm thinking either 4am, midday or 9pm. Each have positives and negatives, I'd like to open a discussion on which (or other times) would be preferable.

4am - a more usual ultra start time. Its winter here so the sun doesn't rise until 7:20am and that means I'll get the night split up into two sections. The sun sets at 8pm and then I'll have 8 hours in the dark on remote trails at my most tired. Also nothing and no one will be awake when I finish, which is important because I will be staying in a shared hostel room (might just upgrade to a solo room for a few nights).

Midday - normal sleep schedule at the start with no rush to get out the door. Full day of daylight to start and full night at the end, except for a few hours of light at the very end. The sunrise might be good motivation at the very end. Still lots of night during tired sections of the run. People will be awake at my start and finish. I'll be sleeping through the following day but this is fairly normal behaviour after super long runs anyway.

9pm - tricky to get myself well rested for the start time, I'd attempt to adjust into sleeping from midday to 7pm or something. I don't often sleep much the night before an ultra but I'm worried the weird sleep schedule will mess me up even more. I get the long night out of the way early and only get a little bit of darkness at the very end. Friends will be awake and might even be able to join me on trail for a while when I'm getting close to finishing. Get to sleep through the night normally afterwards.

Who knows, maybe it takes me 30 hours and half my considerations don't matter anymore. I don't want to over think this but I Do want to make a good decision. Any thoughts?",1596261934

ultrarunning,staringspace,Upping base mileage over time - plans and tips?,"Hi all!

So like most people, I entered a mix of trail and road races this year, and the last one that possibly could have gone ahead has now been cancelled. This means that I now have the perfect opportunity to build a really good base for my running. I want to run my first ultra in 2021/22 (depending on work and life commitments) and whilst I've been consistently running 30km/week (give or take a few km) over lockdown, I want to be consistently running at least 40-50km per week fairly comfortably (obviously with down weeks in there), so I have a good base to work on if I want to train for longer races next year. I know I can run 50km/week without being injured (had a really good training cycle for a trail race last year), so it's more about being sensible and 40-50km becoming a new normal for me, over time, without experiencing burnout.

B) attempt a hard FKT as a replacement effort or 
C) Deload, but take the gains you’ve made and get into a different block.

ultrarunning,Big_air_az,Long distance hiking to ultra running change tips,"Hey all just looking for some advice on getting into ultra running.  Background, I wouldn't really consider myself a ""runner"" and have always been more of a hiker/sometimes trail running but typically I like to do a lot of miles and at a good pace.

For example my longest hike/run I've ever done was rim to rim to rim last year, doing the long route 48 miles in exactly 17 hours.  Definitely not a runners pace but also definitely quicker than a hiking pace. Planning to go back and improve it this fall and do a different route variation.

I'm starting to look more seriously at putting together a training schedule to get into longer runs and eventually official events, and one thing I'm wondering is where really is the line of ""if you're slower than this for a 55k you shouldn't be on the course""?   When is it (or is it) acceptable to power hike the uphills and run as much as you can vs you have to run everything or almost everything?  How do you know you're at a point where you can enter a lower range ultra or if later on I feel good I should just go for it and have the mindset of if I dnf oh well no big deal?

We organized a cookout for the run club to hang out together and give people that wanted to run a chance to do the course. I marked out the course from last years race (flags and chalk), and everyone had a great time. 

When I got home last night someone messaged me that people were talking about the flags on The Facebook page of the race organizers. Seems about 50/50 people thanking whomever marked out the course, and people berating the mystery flag placer as if they were trying to kill the queen.

Looking to possibly move to Victoria this winter. I've been enjoying a really active summer running long distances and am looking to keep it up over the winter so that I can run an ultra next spring/summer. Does anyone live in Victoria and if so, how much opportunity to train do you have during the winter? Are there longer trail systems nearby that would allow for 50km + or do you find yourself running the same loops week in week out? Also, hows the climate?

ultrarunning,alidixon,Trail Marathon Training &amp; Racing Guide - (10 Episode YouTube Series),"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVcSNlTOTR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVcSNlTOTR0)

Hello and welcome to my ultimate guide to training for your first, or next trail marathon race. In this trail marathon training plan I share advice on how to choose your target trail marathon race, create a personalized trail marathon training plan/schedule based on your chosen race, choose the best and potentially mandatory running gear, how to fuel while training and racing, how to avoid overtraining injuries, race tactics, how to recover quickly after training and racing, how to prepare for race day and manage start line nerves, and finally what you can expect once you finish your trail marathon race. This isn’t your regular trail marathon training plan, this is my ultimate guide to smashing your first trail marathon race.  

As well as all this useful information, I’m going to share my personal tips, routines, and hacks that you can use yourself to run a near-flawless first trail marathon race (or next race). I say ‘near-flawless’ because races very rarely play-out to perfection, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be fun, quite the contrary, and a race that leaves room for improvement is a race full of lessons and information to apply for your next trail running race. I think that’s one of the things that makes trail racing so addictive for me – the ability to always improve, or run another race that offers more challenging terrain, weather, or a steeper race profile. 

Bookmark this playlist as there are 10 episodes all together, and I imagine you'll want to revisit certain videos in this series at some point during your trail marathon training.

ultrarunning,TylerCAndrews,"Interview w/ Kyle Masterson, the 4th fastest human in history for 50km (2:44:38 on Wednesday)","*Note - We'll have a longer, live interview on Tuesday at 8pm EDT as part of our Chaski Night Live series* [***on Instagram Live (@Chaski.Endurance)***](https://www.instagram.com/chaski.endurance/) *- be sure to tune in for that!*

On Wednesday, July 22, Chaski Coach and Diadora-sponsored pro Kyle Masterson became the 4th fastest human in history at the 50km distance (31.1 miles), clocking a time of 2:44:38, exactly 1 minute behind the 32-year-old world record at the distance.

How fast is that? It's a pace of 5:17.9 per mile, 3:17.6 per kilometer. It means going through the marathon in 2:18:57 and running another 5 miles. It's ten 5Ks at 16:28 in a row without stopping.

Running in the time of COVID is a unique challenge and this performance highlighted that. Kyle ran in a field of 4 athletes as was the only finisher; two of the runners served as pacers and his fellow racer dropped out after falling well off pace. This left Kyle with 17+ miles of solo running, racing the clock and the history books.

We caught up with Kyle for some quick takes (once he'd had a chance to refuel and catch his breath).

So I’m around 18 months into running. I’m now hitting 45miles per week running 5 days. One long run each week (currently sat at 20miles)

I’m being sensible and increasing my mileage slowly, adding one mile to my long run each week and slowly upping other runs now and then. I’m not an ultra runner but I’m training with that as my goal.

My pace is around 10min/mile on long runs. I’ve purposely slowed to keep my HR below 145.

I find that my glutes are usually the first thing to tire. If my form slacks and I don’t catch it then I can have some pretty tired hip flexors too. They tend to get pretty tight when I run anyway.

Just wondering what some of you guys do outside of running that helps with your physical endurance? Also, I always finish my long runs but sometimes my legs feel pretty stiff. Does anyone have any advice for keeping more mobility in them? Does anyone stop and stretch etc?

Just trying to learn more, thankful for any input.",1595591058

ultrarunning,jeastham1993,A couple of questions training for my first ultra,"I'm running my first ultra in September this year (based on COVID of course). It's a 40 mile run along canals in Wales, so it's very very flat. All my training runs at home are very hilly, which I feel like is going to stand me in good stead. If I can run hard miles on hills them flat should be easy. Is that a fair assumption? Or should I be trying to train as close to race conditions as possible.

My second question, is around protein. Specifically, protein powders. I was reading Scott Jureks autobiography recently and he mentioned having pea protein after his hard runs. Is that something others tend to do? I follow a plant based diet, so no egg/meat based comments please 🙂",1595273185

I may have mentioned it here and there recently, I’d been toying with the idea of signing up for the “Dreadmill 48 Hour Endurance Challenge”. You get the option to choose your event, 100 miles in 48 hours or less, or run the most miles you can in 48 hours, all on the treadmill. I thought this would be a great way to break into the 100 distance because I have plenty of time to do it at my own pace, no fear of cancellation or bad weather, and I actually really don’t mind the treadmill. 

For my Friday long run I tried out some run/walk intervals on a trial basis to see how it went. I ran 20 minutes at 10mm pace, then walked 5 minutes at 3mph pace. This would be the pace I would attempt because even though it’s my first I still have a time goal for under 24 hours. This pace would still afford me plenty of time for stretch, eating, and bathroom breaks. I did 20 miles, felt great, and kept my heart rate nice and low the whole time.  Since it went so well I went ahead and signed up!  Now I just need to keep my mileage up! Any other suggestions I’m all ears.",1595259444
ultrarunning,bamaguy13,Hydration vest recs?,"So I was never really a runner until this year.

ultrarunning,crewchiefsnham89,One of My Better DNF’s lol,"   I went on the trail run today I had posted about earlier, to see how far I could go without being injured and (almost) without running to prepare. I made it 10 miles with a 10lb pack, was feeling pretty good so I ditched the pack and ran another two.

   Pain in and under my right hip flexor came and went (pain everywhere, actually, I was exceptionally sore before the run started-but all the other kinks worked themselves out) but around mile 12 it sank in and stayed, so I walked back. Overall a good day.

I tripled my volume of planks and situps this week so perhaps that is why that was my weak point, among other reasons.

   I was hoping for 15+ but am quite happy particularly with my lower legs (feeling solid) and back (chronic pain actually has been receding).

   I’d love to try 31 miles sometime but it has to go on the back burner. I’m going to keep jogging to warm up for my other workouts (2-5 miles a week) and next time I feel good try again. Haha this time maybe on a better trail w/o a pack.


Cons:

- I’ve averaged ~2 mpw the last 2 years

- More or less partied, worked out, and danced the 3 days leading up to this

- The last 3-4 mornings I have woken up feeling very sore and tired, especially my quads

- Had to do a different trail I had never been to before, much more awkward not feeling prepared

Pro’s

- 12 miles is pretty good for me, and the intense soreness in my legs helped me find a pace I imagine is quite sustainable for me (8-9 min/mile, as opposed to the ~6-7’s I’d run for a 3 mi)

- My lower legs and feet are much stronger than a decade ago

- I generally learned a lot and had a good time


   I’ve got to prioritize mainly getting my life together lol (it’s coming :) ) and my situps and swimming, but hopefully do a 50k at some point when I am actually fresh and ready.

Race is Run Rabbit Run. I made it halfway last year and am feeling much stronger this year. I lucked out by having a week in Keystone and want to make the most of it for training.

I just finished a training block and last week was a recovery week, driving to the mountains from sea level with a few hour long runs in Boulder and some hiking in RMNP (tip-o-the-hat to CO for taking masks seriously, even running on trails!). This week is the start of my endurance ramp - so if there’s a week to experiment, this is it.

I plan on finishing the week with a long run up a mountain (likely Keystone, though Grays is super tempting) to get some quality time on switchbacks and ascents at altitude and dial in my race strategy (I messed up this terrain last year and went too slow on it - missed cutoffs).

How should I structure my week so I’m not wiped out by Friday for my long run? I worry I’m going to get sucked into hard trails every time I leave the condo (I have no willpower when I see a fun trail). 

Easy runs every day just to get miles at altitude? A hard run early in the week? Just hike all week (mini-taper) and aim for a strong effort on Friday?

Think that’s good enough for starters? I’ll have phone reception and probably people in case I bonk/break something. Risking a &lt;3 mile walk seems safe, and can make my pickup at the trailhead my aid station.


I’m in pretty good shape from work and dancing (and I grew up wrestling, running cross country, and swimming). I recently I did my first ever timed ruck (just over 67lbs 3 miles in 31:16) and a 3-mile run in 20:50. Pretty much no prep for either, just work and dancing.

Anyway like I said, it has me curious. I seem to respond well to very intense, once-a-week workouts so I’m considering running or rucking far/fast on Sundays, or every other Sunday, and dedicating the weekdays to the calisthenics and swimming I need to improve on. Those are easily my weak areas.

TL; DR How far can I get on Gatorade/water, clif bars and almonds also I like to ramble",1594795182

ultrarunning,AspenKi,How much hunger is too much hunger after an ultra?,"So! I did my first ultra on Saturday. (Yayyy!) The East Bay Skyline trail, kinda hilly, logged 33 miles. But yesterday afternoon, the cravings hit — and today, I’ve already consumed about 3 days worth of food, which is starting to seem kinda freaky to me.
The thing is, I was able to eat solid food all the way through, my stomach was fine (even though at some point, everything tasted kinda disgusting), I drank enough water, and a friend of mine invited me to a barbecue afterwards, where I celebrated with hamburgers and corn. So I think I had enough nutrition throughout the day.

Training for a road marathon, I had lots of miles under me but not many hill miles. I don’t like trails in the summer. Snakes and all... 

But last night at 7pm I started the race. The mental grind was immense. It was 10 laps of a 5k, out and back. They had a trail option and a gravel road option. I chose the gravel cause again, snakes and all. Also, I didn’t want to mess up an ankle and not be able to train for the marathon. 

After lap 5, around 1:30am, a thunderstorm hit so I hid out in the tent for a while and let the lightening subside. But the rain continued till the finish. 

My wife ran lap 7 with me and then it was just me. In the dark. Mostly alone for the last 3 laps. Miles 29 and 32 were my fastest. My legs felt strong. My running seemed to improve as I went. 

At 3:58am I crossed the Finish line as the 2nd male on the gravel race. Super proud of the result. I didn’t set out to place, only to put forth a good effort and finish.

### Learning
1. I can do 50 miles!
2. Don't start fasted. I.e. get up earlier you lazy git.
3. Take on more water and more salt throughout. Maybe Tailwind/similar.
4. Start slower to keep pace for later.
5. Use lap marker workouts on watch for pacing, not mileage-based which goes out of sync.

### Miles [0] to [3]
Stoke Park to Parkway (3 miles) - ave 9:00 per mile.
Easy start. 

2 min pause for someone joining. 

### Miles [3] to [16]
Parkway to Keynsham (13.7 miles) - ave 8:50 per mile.
Felt easy and fast, around 8:30 mile pace apart from stiles and a walk up a hill. Good weather, gentle downhills.  

5 min pause to eat and drink.

### Miles [16] to [27]
Keynsham to Barrow (11 miles) - ave 11:15 per mile.
Headwind through the water meadows. Pushed, but it took a toll and I ran out of fuel/puff before the high point halfway mark - had to walk a couple of miles and eat a pack of sugary sweets to recover some strength.

5-10 min stop to eat and drink.

### Miles [27] to [38]
Barrow to Henbury (11 miles) - ave 11:30 per mile. 
Feeling much stronger after the stop. Lots of hills which I walked up. Lovely gentle downhill section for 4 miles, a short uphill slog and then a straight shot to the rest point. Disaster - shop closed for another hour until 3pm! Really lucky a friend lived nearby and could give me extra water. 

10 min stop to eat and drink.

### Miles [38] to [49]
Henbury to Parkway (10.5 miles) - ave 10:01 per mile
Hilly again for the first part, but picked up the pace on a flatter section after that.

### Miles [49] to [52]
Parkway to Stoke Park (3 miles) - ave ... not sure, really slow!
Kept some pace up to the 50 mile point but ran out of water then it was a total slog into a headwind, big effort just trying to push one foot in front of the other. But made it!

What would your advice be? Should I just continue training like I do now or could it be beneficial to incorporate some training more related to ultra training, like back to back long runs?

The ascent is split up into 5 similar sized, equally spaced hills.

* I haven't run further than 30k, but I am flexible in the date of this attempt so I can log some longer runs before then. My current milage is in the 50-65km (30-40mi) /week range, which I've been holding for about 4 months. Is this a decent enough base? What would you say is the preferred longest run prior to a slightly-more-than-50k?
* At the moment, I have a 2L bladder in a camel back. I would like to increase this capacity, with some soft flasks up front, as well as some pockets for stashing food / nutrition. At the moment I am considering the [Salomon S-LAB Sense Ultra 5](https://www.ultramarathonrunningstore.com/Salomon-S-LAB-SENSE-ULTRA-5-SET-Race-Vest-p/slabsenseultra5set.htm).

The only thread I've found is [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/9p06hk/best_value_gps_watch_with_breadcrumbstyle/) from October 2018, but presumably lots has changed since then.

I'm not opposed to buying second hand. I am already in the Polar Flow ecosystem, so I'm leaning towards the Grit X. I would like to battery life to last for any potential 100k events I do in the future.
* When out on the road for a longer time like this, how do you deal with nature calling? How can I go to the toilet on an unsupported run?
* Any other points I've not considered?

However he's now getting nominated for Pride of Britain awards alongside true hero's, appears it's a fame grab by deception.

The guy is a fraud. When this started he was initially claiming he was doing half marathons every day for 30 days around his coffee table using GPS data indoors (highly inaccurate) but said it was verified with a step counter. Anyone who questions this he immediately blocks and deletes their comments on various social media and Strava.

After a bit he changed challenge after claiming this was while fasting during Ramadan but increased the number of days 50 half marathons in 50 days to try get more attention.

Around day 42 he suddenly switched to running full marathons as he wasn't getting any attention and obviously wanted attention like Major Tom walking lengths of his garden for the NHS. 

He then realised at this point he was leading distance runner on Strava in UK so switched to running ultra marathons every day (as you do!) One at 52 miles!! However people started flagging to Strava the dodgy GPS  data on his runs and he was removed from leaderboards.

Sprinkled within these ""ultra marathons"" he's running 1 mile times quicker than world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj!! So needs to head to Olympics once he finishes this fake challenge. Plus overall pace for these ultras is highly suspect anyway with lots of 10 to 12 min/miles considering they're back to back around a coffee table that a generous lap would be 6 feet (3 metres).

During these ""marathons"" he never has a high heart rate  even when running world record mile laps and is very low normally between 100 bpm and 120 bpm.

The ""live"" streams videos of his ""marathons"" never last duration of his runs and appear to be looped too when missing frames, goes out of focus.

Finally he would be burning upwards of 3,000 calories a day yet he still quite a big fella despite supposedly spending hours and hours every day for last 10 weeks and his body would be in absolute pieces. 

He said he would run marathons outside when the lockdown ended but is yet to fulfill this promise. Great he is trying to raise money but not under false pretences and deceiving people to donate with him claiming he is doing something he's not however now claiming awards is where it gets a bit too much.

TLDR; Guy is claiming he is running 100 marathons in 100 days but he's a fraud and deceiving people to donate and potentially get awards",1593832638
ultrarunning,RahuiRunner,Trail Shoe Recommendation,"Hey everyone!

So I've been running for a while now and my shoes never seem to last. Currently I do about 40-50 Miles a week and my shoes can't keep their tread. 

I'm using the Salmon XA Amphib 2 and I love them, but I have about 300 miles on them and the tread is fading a bit. I think they'll last a little bit longer but I can't be spending a $180 every two-three months. 

What are you guys recommendation for good training shoes that last? I do a lot of hard and varied trail, looking for something with a 3-4mm drop. 

Thanks!",1593827714

ultrarunning,LordPoopturd,Dealing with long layoffs,"I've had my fair share of long layoffs due to various reasons, so I'm not looking for advice on how to come back. I've been down that road before; start off slow, 10% rule, strength train, blah blah blah. I guess I'm more curious about how long layoffs fall into the bigger picture. In the past year-and-a-half that I've taken running seriously, I've been injured more often than not. This is because I have a very good endurance base from running competitively 9+ years ago, so I get really impatient when I'm meant to ""take it easy"".

I had a pretty good streak earlier this year, training from January to May with zero problems. But after a steep increase in mileage and intensity (ramped up from 25 to 45 mpw in about 6 weeks, most of it too fast), I eventually ended up with posterior tibial tendonitis in my ankle that is still keeping me from running two months later.

Has anyone else had a similar experience to this as a runner? Every time I take another crack at running, I figure out how to stay healthy a bit longer, but I inevitably end up sidelined with an injury for a long time. Then rinse and repeat. I have yet to crack the code of staying healthy. Just wondering if anyone else has been down a similar road and was eventually able to train/race consistently without getting hurt.",1593610227
ultrarunning,LaurenClement,Surviving but not thriving,"I ran my first 50k over the weekend, to see how I was progressing in my training, and what I still needed to work on. It went better than I thought it would, and physically, I made it through fine. But later that day I realized how few calories and carbs I had taken in, and it felt like i was in a mental haze for another day or so (I’m guessing due to lack of calories) I thought my plan for fueling was better than it turned out to be. So, how do you all plan for food/ calories in ultras? Do you have a rule of thumb that you stick to? A tried and true plan, or do you work with a trainer for your own personal needs? Do you all have suggestions for books to read on the topic?",1593569262
ultrarunning,RoaringFloorboard,"Completed my first 50-mile race this weekend! Reckless Raven 50, Whitehorse, Yukon (warning: minimal training involved)","TL;DR: I'm a non-runner who trained for six weeks, ran a 50-miler and had a blast doing it. 

DISCLAIMER: I'm not recommending that you or anyone you know should go and do 50 miles on six weeks of ""training."" It worked well for me is all. I'm just trying to share my experience and hopefully people don't downvote the shit out of me.

**Background**

I'm 45 years old with a full time job and two boys under 5. I am just a recreational athlete, mostly a cyclist as I do a lot of mountain biking, winter biking, bikepacking, gravel riding.... I also do a bit of hiking, cross country skiing and I play basketball 1-2 times a week in the winter. 

Last time I did any real running was 20 years ago when I trained for and ran the local trail half-marathon. Up until May that was my longest run of my life. 

I rarely do organized events but I am no stranger to endurance and definitely have a lot of experience on the mental side of it. I've done some pretty ambitious bike rides, hikes and multi-day backcountry trips. I'm pretty good at hiking up hills which is definitely an asset. 

The Reckless Raven 50 was started locally here in 2017 and I was immediately struck by how awesome the course is. I kind of stuck it in the back of my mind that I should do it one day.

The Reckless Raven course is 80.5 km with about 3000 m of climbing. There is a minimal amount of gravel road otherwise it's all singletrack, ski trails or quad trails with a ton of time spent above treeline. About 20% of the race course is off-trail running in the alpine. Winning times are in the 8.5 - 9.5 hour range and the cut-off time is 15 hours. 

**Lead-up to the race** 

COVID canceled basketball season around February and I was struggling with for motivation to do much of anything else outdoors. I ended up doing a handful of 30-40 minute runs in March on the snow just to get out of the house and keep my fitness up but I can't say I enjoyed them. Come April I was out on the bike as usual. 

On May 12 I just decided to go for a trail run and went for 17 km and surprisingly enjoyed myself and didn't die. Later that I week I did 22 km (the longest run of my life at that point) and once again felt pretty darn good. What I liked about running was I felt like I was getting way more exercise in 2 hours that I would on a 2-hour bike ride. 

This planted a seed in my mind about maybe doing half of the Reckless Raven as it can be done as a two-person relay. I started sounding out friends to do a relay team with but was not getting any takers. 

I'm not a person who would follow a strict training plan. I used to coach competitive cyclists so I understand training plans, periodization, tapering and whatnot. I prefer to just go by what I feel like doing and how my body is feeling. I'm only going out to have fun and if I don't feel like going out I probably won't. 

So for my ""training plan"" I wanted to avoid doing too much running, lest I burn out or injure myself. I decided to do 1 or maybe 2 long runs a week and see how I was feeling. Otherwise I would just ride bikes as usual. In May I did a couple of big alpine hikes, one a day hike and one an overnighter. I also tried to do some squats and lunges and stuff when I was out with my kids at the park to strengthen my quads. 

The first week of June I did a 35 km run including some legs of the race course with the biggest climbs and a lot of off-trail hiking/running. After this run I knew I could complete half the race so it wasn't interesting to me anymore. If I was going to register it would have to be for the full. 

June 13 I ran another big loop with sections of the course included that totalled 40 km. The organizers had announced that the race was still going ahead with COVID precautions in place. It would be locals only as no out of town racers could come due to travel restrictions. This was when I decided to sign up. 

I did my last significant run of 24 km on June 19. At this point I had run about 250 km in six weeks so an average of about 40 km / 26 miles a week. I had run every section of the course. The week before the race I just did a couple of easy jogs and one hard 2-hour bike ride. 

During this time I also watched some YouTube videos to try to improve my running technique. I also watched Unbreakable which blew my mind and then I watched like a hundred more videos on Western States. I lurked in r/ultrarunning as well as reading a bunch of the articles on irunfar. I found this [joyful runner article](https://www.joyfulathlete.com/2007/02/22/how-to-run-your-first-50-miler/) super helpful and it really gave me confidence to try a 50-miler. 

I also bought myself some Hokas and a running vest and stuff so at least I looked the part of a runner. 

My training splits on the course sections added up to 10:20 so I figured 12 hours was a realistic but ambitious goal. I knew I could complete the first half in good time but had no idea what would happen to me in the second half of the race. 

**Race Report**

The day before the race my wife took the kids out of town so I could get some sleep. I had all day to putter around getting my stuff organized and doing the check-in. I was feeling really good about my strategy for the race and really looking forward to the start line. 

On June 28 I was up at 5:00, out the door and ready to start the race at 6:00. The first section is 12.5 km of good running on ski trails and singletrack. I tried to take it easy here and in the end I was bang on 1:25 which is the same time I ran in in training. I was feeling a couple twinges in my left knee which was somewhat worrying. I made a quick stop at the aid station and headed out for the biggest climb of the race.

The next section climbs 600 m over 5 km up Haeckel Hill, most of it up a steep downhill mountain biking trail. I made pretty good time here hiking uphill with poles. I hit the next aid station and fueled up again. I had to take on extra fluids as I would be about 3 hours before another aid station. At this point I was 17.5 km into the race and 2:20 on the clock. 

The next leg covers Sumanik Ridge which is an absolute highlight of the course. It starts with a short, steep descent where my knee started really acting up. I shuffled down it and then started climbing again into the alpine where the course is off-trail along an alpine ridge for about 14 km. I do pretty well in this section as there is a lot of hiking and I am still using the poles. I can keep up with or pass the people around me who are trying to run a lot more. I ran a few easy sections but not nearly as much as I ran in training as my knee still isn't happy. It feels like my IT band is acting up, not something I had encountered on any of my training runs. 

Once the descent off the ridge steepens I'm still having trouble getting downhill effectively. I stop for a few minutes to try to work on my knee a bit. It eventually becomes a quad trail and I am able to run the flats and some of the easier downhiills coming into Jackson Lake aid station at km 37.5. I arrive in 5:26 which is a slower than I expected, mostly due to being so slow running the downhill section. 

This is the relay exchange point as well as the only place you can have crew assistance. I had friends waiting for me and spent about 15 minutes here: changed my shoes and socks, ate and drank a bunch and reloaded with supplies. I used a roller on my IT band and also taped it. The tape really seemed to help but unfortunately I had brought KT tape which didn't stay on for more than a couple km.

Leaving the aid station is a lot of double track with gradual uphills. My plan from this point on had always been to run-hike to try to save my legs. I was finding it OK to run on the flatter terrain. I hiked another good climb up into the alpine and once again had to sort of run-shuffle on what was a really fun running descent when I trained on it. I rolled into the aid station at Fish Lake at km 52.5 in 7:45. 

At this point I had figured out that my knee wasn't bothering me on the climbs but going uphill was loading up my IT band so that when I had to go downhill right away it was really unhappy. Once I got onto flatter terrain again I could get it to loosen up and run OK. Otherwise I am feeling a bit tired but doing good in terms of legs, energy, eating and drinking. It's been a great day for weather, warm and sunny in morning but then it clouded over in the afternoon so it didn't get too hot. 

The next section is short but has the steepest climb of the race followed by another off-trail section in the alpine across Knuckle Ridge. I was fading a bit here and my normally vigorous hiking was pretty anemic followed by another sad looking downhill run to the next aid station. 58.5 km in I am at 8:50.  This was the section where my race time was by far the slowest compared to my training time. 

I got out of the aid station and kept up the run-hike thing across some really nice alpine singletrack before starting the biggest descent of the day. I was able to somewhat manage running downhill until I hit some steeper mountain bike trails where again I struggled. This segment ends with 2 km on a flat fire road which was definitely my low point for motivation. I really struggle running on roads. 

I got into the last checkpoint at 10:45 and I still had 9.5 km to go. This section took me 1:05 in training so I knew it would be tight. I loaded up on Coke, pounded a jumbo peanut butter cup and headed out. I decided I would not look at my watch after leaving the aid station until I popped out on the final ski trail with about 1 km to go. 

After a hiking a short, steep climb I put my head down and started running on ski trails and then a long 7 km section of singletrack that goes on forever but is gradually downhill. I was feeling pretty good actually and able to run almost the entire section other than a few short uphills that I walked. The mellow grades were OK for my knee. When I got to the final ski trail I still had over ten minutes to spare so I knew I was golden. 

I ran in the last section where my family was waiting for me to cross the finish line. In the end I stopped the clock at 11:56 so I made my sub-12 hour goal. 

**Post-race analysis**

It was a great day! I had a lot of fun and aside from my knee just about everything went perfectly. I feel like I could have run faster but I also recognize there are a lot of other things that could have gone wrong and slowed me down or stopped me. I had no issues with feet or blisters, was able to eat and drink, managed my pace and energy pretty well, and the weather and course conditions were good. 

I was pretty banged up at the end of the race and basically went home and didn't get off the couch until bedtime. The next day I was feeling stiff but not too bad and now two days later I feel quite good and went for an easy bike ride. The knee feels fine but I do plan on going to the physio to try to figure out what might have happened. 

Will I do another ultra? Probably not anytime soon, especially with COVID, but I have found that running in the mountains can be a lot of fun so maybe...?

ultrarunning,jjdontplay,Effort to Cut weight or just Train?,"Training for a 50 mile in late September. Will be my second ultra, October 2019 was my first a 50k. Last July I started that training after about a year of CrossFit to get back in running shape. I was a VERY lean(less than 10% bf) 165 on race day (6’2 height).
Just running focused now for the past year with very little lifting. Weighing in at ~180lbs. 4 weeks into my 16 week training for my 50 Ultra. 
Running slow and long but I’m actually faster than last year despite 15 lbs heavier, 5:15 mile at my local running clubs summer trials last week done. This time last year I ran 5:40ish

To get to the point, get stricter on diet and try to drop to 165-170 for race day? Or don’t worry about it, continue to train and eat when hungry. Honestly my diet is good....if you cut out the alcohol. 

TLDR Training for 50 mile, 15 lbs heavier than last years 50k training but actually faster. Cut alcohol/eat healthy to drop weight or keep plugging along as is?

ultrarunning,MacyWindu,How in the hell does anyone run ultra distance in the humidity?,"I spent my youth and all the way through college in the Rocky Mountains. Do you know what the have out there? CRISP, DRY AIR that's what. I freely admit this gave me a pretty good ego, thinking that I had a let up over others because I was doing ""real"" mountain running, and thus had a training advantage. Now I live in the hills of NJ, and I can't go for a damn *walk in the shade* without sweating. This is my first summer on the East Coast where I'm training for an ultra, though I've done two in years past. Someone tell me how the hell I'm supposed to get any running done when my mornings are at 90% humidity. Nobody should have to live like this! it started getting humid about 6 weeks ago, and I feel like I've made no progress acclimating to it. Even later in the day when it's 'less humid', I'm still looking at 50% or higher.

Now that my rant is over, how do I adjust my training? Is running 10 miles in humid conditions comparable to more miles in drier (more dry) conditions? Can I scale back my weekly miles and still get adequate training in?

ultrarunning,joejance,Twelve hour trail race advice?,"I ran my first ultra, a 50k race, the last weekend of May (4 weeks ago this weekend).  Similar to efforts by many others out there, I put on a solo race for myself, with the help of my wife.  Prior to that effort I was averaging 50 miles per week.

In three weeks time there is a 12 hour trail race for which I'm signed up, and I need advice on it.  The race has a lot of elevation gain (about 500 feet every 4 mile loop).  

I'm ramping back up on miles.  Here is what my mileage has looked like and my plan leading up to the 12 hour event:

* Week 1: 15 miles (all recovery speed on sidewalk)
* Week 2: 20 miles  (all recovery speed on sidewalk)
* Week 3: 30 miles (mostly trail)
* Week 4: 45 miles (**this week** - mostly trail)
* Week 5: 50 miles (planned - mostly trail)
* Week 6: 30 miles (planned - mostly trail)
* Week 7: 10 miles during the week, **12 hour race** at end of week

Is this too aggressive?   There is also a 6 hour race that I could probably switch to if it is.

ultrarunning,jleonardbc,Crushed my 50K PB yesterday by &gt;15 minutes. Also drank stream water for the first time. Coincidence?,"I'm by no means a fast ultra-er, but yesterday I finished 50K in about 5:53, which is a big achievement for me. All on roads, with 2000 feet of elevation change, mostly from two big hills in the second half. I felt pretty good most of the time. A few contributing factors:

* I've been hitting &gt;60 mpw for the past two months, and 70-80 for the past month. I do some HIIT and tempos, but I focus mainly on low HR training.

* Two weeks ago I got a gallon water jug and I've been drinking all of it every day. Fluids I drink during runs don't count toward the jug.

* I got new shoes (Altra) and socks (Injinji)—very comfy!

* I was religious about taking salt pills every 45 minutes or so.

* I've dropped 5+ pounds since my previous attempts, mostly due to increased training volume (RIP upper body muscles).

* I got a water filter and a system to pump the water directly into the bladder in my vest. This enabled me to leave home with the bladder only halfway full. A third of the way in, when I'd emptied it, I filled a ""dirty bag"" from a stream in Amish farm country, hooked the bag up to my bladder through the drinking tube (meaning I didn't have to open the top of my vest), and was able to start moving again while holding the bag and squeezing it to send the water through the filter into the bladder.

I finished 2019 with a 50 mile race (just under 10 hours). 

At some point I’d like to run a 100, but I’m not sure how or when. After the 50 miler I had a limp for a week (but was running only four days after the 6hr/36 mile). Should I get another 50 under my belt first, or try to find a 100k? Also, would a last man standing be a good way to broach the distance, or would that be harder than just entering a 100 mile race to begin with?

ultrarunning,gl21133,Burnout,"I'm just gonna barf some words here, hopefully something comes out of it.  I had grand plans for this season, 2x 100K, 1x 50M, 2x 50K, plus a local road marathon and a couple halfs.  Training started well and was progressing great, then (like almost every other runner on the planet) COVID bulldozed everything.  First half canceled, first 50K postponed, first 100K canceled.  They were the ones I was looking forward to the most, so it was a bummer.

I shook it off, adjusted the training schedule to the next 100K, and got on with it.  Things started getting worse, I developed what ended up being achilles tendonopathy (thankfully fully on the mend now), and I started getting really down.  The 100k is actually still happening, they danced back and forth for a bit and ended up adding a number of rules to address COVID, and frankly I largely lost interest.  I think the training would get me through, but I opted to drop late last week.

I feel completely burnt out at the moment, I was honestly worried that doing the 100k might sour me on ultras for a long time.  I feel like a lot of the runs are now just going through the motions, not so fun.  The most fun I had recently was getting caught in a storm that absolutely hammered for a 20-30 minutes, not a stitch of clothing was dry when I got back to the car but it was a wild change of pace.

I stepped back this weekend and thought about what I wanted.  I hopped on the mountain bike on Saturday and did a couple hours on trails.  I still ran yesterday, but did so late in the evening, coming in by headlamp just before midnight.  It feels nice to feel less beholden to a training plan and just do what I want.

I still have a 50K, 50M, and road marathon on the calendar this year, but all late.  I expect they may be canceled, time will tell.  I think I might do a few triathlons too to shake things up.

What I'm trying to figure out is the optimal plan for the weekend leading up to the race. I've read that it's best to spend at least a week at the altitude of the race, or if you can't do that, to show up at the last possible minute. I fall in the latter category. The closest towns (20 minutes away) are at 5000' and 3500', and the race is a 3.5 hour drive from home.

So my options are:

- Leave from home at 1:30 AM to make packet pickup and shuttle by 6 AM.

- Spend the night at a hotel at 3500' and drive 20 minutes

- Spend the night at a lower altitude hotel and drive up to an hour on race day morning

Hope every one is well and crushing their goals or at the very least having fun while trying. I am not having very much fun in my life right now, and it's got me thinking that I need to pursue a cause of some kind. Immediately I thought of using ultrarunning (the thing that can lift me out of depression) to raise awareness for men's mental health struggles. I've heard of people doing similar things with races, but was always unsure of what that entailed.

Ideally I would sign up for a challenging race (when the world allows us to do so) or run a self-supported event and just broadcast it somehow. I have some questions and concerns about all of this and would  love feedback from those with some experience.

How can I convert a race into spreading awareness?

Is spreading awareness more or less effective when also trying to raise funds for a charity?

Did it feel like you made enough of an impact?

What sorts of mistakes did you make?

Did you enlist the help of others/did they join in your efforts?

Did you reach out to a relevant charity or organization for more visibility or sponsorship?

Enter Kris Brown who's earned himself quite the reputation as a US belt buck collector and has offered up [his advice on fueling for 100s](https://www.chaski.run/post/fueling-for-ultras-12-24-hours), (i.e. races lasting 12 to 24 hours).

Kris writes with years of running and racing under his belt and is really a jack of all trades when it comes to the distance and terrain he races. With his homebase in Santa Barbara, California, Kris has come to specialize in hilly 50k-100k races. In 2018, Kris walked away with a top-ten finish at Western States 100, and more recently he finished the 2019 Spartan Ultra World Championships in 5th place and was the top American at Tarawera 100K.

ultrarunning,PeanutButterHolyFuck,Need help with a ultrarunning/eating/mental health issue.,"Howdy y’all. This is the first time I’ve ever commented on my struggles with running and my body image. 28 year old guy who I guess is always recovering from the existence of being a chubby awkward teenager and too skinny of a man.  I’ve run for most of my adolescent and adult life including a current 10.5 year streak. I’ve started to run into some issues with my body image as I’ve cut my mileage way back and my diet hasn’t changed.


I won’t bore everyone with the messed up details of my mental health, but just know that it’s a little wacky up there. I have lots of professional help and I am actively trying to get better so no worries there.

The issue I’m having now is that as I have gained a bit of belly fat and it’s something I’ve always noticed bothered me. I am fully aware that it is a small amount (I’m 6’1” and 155-165 pounds) and I’m an overall healthy and fit person. I just feel that I’m stuck in this negative feedback loop of “I don’t want to run or workout because I’m depressed“, “I don’t eat as healthy because I’m depressed”,”I gain a small amount of weight and it makes me depressed.”


Does anyone else have some experience with this? It’s relatively new for me. I tried some intermittent fasting this week as an “easy fix” and went for a run after a 24 hour fast and a full day of work on my feet. Not surprisingly it felt pretty rough. But it also scared me. It was the first time my body image actually informed my behavior in a potentially dangerous way. Trying to nip it in the bud. Running is normally my safe haven from mental illness but now it’s become the manifestation of it.

Edit: WOW. I’m blown away by all of these responses. I more or less knew what I needed to hear, but hearing it from others just has such a different impact. Thank you all for your long and thoughtful responses. I’m holding my head a little higher. I think I’m just overwhelmed with stress in every part of my life at the moment and couldn’t think myself out of this rut. Best of luck to all of you who shared similar stories.",1591890038

ultrarunning,spack6789,training for first 100 miler - advice on back to back runs,"Hey! I'm training to do my first 100 mile run later this summer and was wondering what advice people could give on back to back runs?

My current plan for each week is to do a long run in the region of 33-34 miles then the next day do a 20 mile run. Then for the rest of the week I do a 15 and 10 miler, focusing on speed and hills as well as a sprint session, with 2 or 3 core workout sessions thrown in as well. Normally 2 days (before and after b2b long runs) are non-running days.

Does anyone have any experience of doing back to back runs on 3 consecutive days? E.g. in my case it would probably be 33, 20 then 10/15. Could this be a better plan than doing 2 days in a row? Most of the training plans I've heard about advise 2 days b2b but a few mention 3.

Also, in terms of the overall structure of my training does it look like I'm doing enough?

Statement from the website/an email sent out yesterday:

&gt; After much discussion, deliberation, and debate, the Cascade Crest 100 Board of Directors has come to the unanimous decision to cancel this year's event.

&gt; There are many moving parts to organizing a 100 mile event on a normal year. This year, with the public health concerns and Covid-19 related restrictions, those variables are multiplied and are underlined by the uncertainty of being able to hold the event at all. And, as we debated possible alternatives and variations of the event, we knew that we couldn't responsibly hold the event in a manner that would provide the Cascade Crest experience we've all come to love and expect.

&gt; We understand and share your disappointment, as Cascade Crest is a big annual family reunion for most of us. But we're excited to see you all next year for an even better, healthier event.

&gt; So, what now? The current entrants list and waitlist will be rolled to next year. All current entrants will have the option of requesting a 90% refund of their registration fee ($270) by emailing me at info@cascadecrest100.com. Refunds are sent via paypal, so please include which email account your PayPal account is linked to. A refund removes you from the entrants list.

I was supposed to pace a friend on what was to be their first 100.

Yesterday I did a 50k, it was warmer than I’m used to and I spent about 20 miles on pretty technical dirt trails, the rest was gravel. I didn’t get a new running pack yet so I planned on doing a 11 mile loop 3x and using my car as an aid station. 

I was averaging 11:00/mi up until 24 miles when I started doing a lot of walking. I did a little running each mile and ended up averaging 12:30/mi. I was pretty thirsty, it was a bad idea in hindsight(2.5 hrs without water). 

My feet hurt and I was exhausted but otherwise my body was in good shape. The end was hard though. How much can you expect to run in a 50k vs a 50 mile run? Is it more about embracing the suck to get from 50k to 50 miles or do I need to train better for a 50k?",1591556279

ultrarunning,FullTiltWard,Heaviest Training block ever - tackling the Great Virtual Race Across Tennessee,"I also posted this in /running, but /ultrarunning seems to be the better subreddit for this. 

This odd pandemic situation has changed many aspect of my usual lifestyle, which formerly included massive travel and work. So as a result, I've been able to spend a good deal more time with training. I entered the Great Virtual Race Across Tennessee, which is a 635 mile event. The idea is that you can keep track and enter mileage (on the honor system) you either deliberately do outdoors or on a treadmill (my totals are 100% outdoor). Then if you complete the race, you can then head back across the state to hit 1000 miles or 1270 miles to complete an out and back. 

Amazingly, there are almost 20,000 other people tackling this challenge. The end date is August 31st giving people 4 months to complete - an average of just over 5 miles a day keeps people in front of the buzzard. About 13000 people are on pace to complete. 

I wrapped up the first crossing yesterday in 34 days. And maintaining my health, mentally and physically has been an important consideration. The intensity of my runs thus far has been modest. I will do about one tempo paced run a week. Most of the time it takes a few miles to 'warm up' and I feel creaky until my body adapts and rises up. 

I've also incorporated a walk with my wife as part of the day's totals on occasion. This gives me 'easy' miles and loosens up my whole body so the running isn't as tough. My theory is that it irons out the kinks and circulates blood, etc, in an easy way flushing out the system and resetting it for the next run. 

I also generally don't eat or take in calories until 2PM every day as part of a prescribed window of eating I've found agrees with me. 

In any event, I'm pleased and surprised that this 52 year old body can maintain at this pace and volume. Now, just 100 more days to go in the GVRAT event. So I figure I'll be able to hit my goal of the across and back run in good style. 

NOTE: there are several runners from around the world who have significantly more than doubled my totals. The lead runner is 1400 miles into the race now.

ultrarunning,quietglow,Toe callus woes,"I thought I'd had every ultrarunning related injury -- that was nice because you can run more with the extra time not spend researching injuries.

Alas, I finally got a new one. On both feet, the toe next to my big toe has begun developing a callus which basically rings the pad of the toe. It doesn't go all the way around the front of my toe. The part of the pad closest to my foot has the densest callus. Overall it feels very similar to the common callus lots of people get when they have peaked little toes (which I have also started to get).The problem with these calluses is that on increasingly shorter runs, they begin to get painful and/or turn into blisters, kinda. It seems like now anything &gt;25mi and they act up.

I have changed basically nothing about my footwear for 1k miles+. I've been wearing the same type of shoes for every run since last sept or so, when I switched from altras to hoka stinsons. I also started wearing injinji socks about the same time. I switched to both for reasons having nothing to do with feet problems because, in fact, I used to brag about how my feet were utterly invincible. I've done a couple 100s w/o even a blister. I am somewhat suspicious that one or both of these switches is responsible for this problem and it just took a few months to manifest.

I own Fixing your Feet, and I've read the section of calluses, and I did some of the stuff he suggests to start removing them. I am moderately freaking out as I have a multi-day big miles fastpack trip coming up end of the month, and I seriously am dreading trudging many miles with toe pain.

questions for yall:

1. If you've had this prob, how did you fix it?
2. Any thoughts about what actually causes this? I can't figure out whats rubbing there to cause the callus. It almost seems like my foot strike or position must have changed.
3. I am tempted to go out and buy a pair of altras. Switching shoes right before doing a big thing seems dramatic, but I am worried that if I don't find a silver bullet I might be screwed anyway.

Thanks for your thoughts.",1591219513
ultrarunning,bacloldrum,A dilemma- do I run or not?,"Looking for some advice. 

The weekend before last (10 days), I ran my first 50k. Felt great leading up to it. My highest mileage week was 50 miles and I tapered before the 50k. It went fairly well though the elevation affected me way more than I expected (6000 feet) and I finished in 7:25. 

Other than general soreness, I haven’t experienced any injuries or lingering pains before, during, or after. I took last week off in a combination of rest and laziness, but ran a few miles on Monday of this week and felt fine. 

Apart from actual running I’ve been feeling low on energy and pretty down mentally. I have heard of the “post-race blues” and am wondering if that has something to do with it. I’m not sure if my feelings are related or not but either way I’m finding myself in a weird dilemma of whether to rest or push through in a situation like this. Ordinarily I try to push through when I don’t feel like running and know the endorphin rush will hit and I’ll be glad I ran. Right now, I’m questioning if maybe my reluctance to run is my body telling me it needs more rest and recovery, or on the contrary is the thing I need most to push through and go run so I feel better.

ultrarunning,Casper_Mac,Questions/Advice about multiple day Ultra Running Challenge," Hey guys and gals,

Later this year I am looking to undertake a charity run across the neck of the UK following for the most part the old line of Hadrian's wall in the North of England. The route I will be taking is a single trail path know as the [Hadrian's Wall footpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian's_Wall_Path) with a total distance of 84 miles.

A little background about me (basic stats listed at the end of the post) since I thought a little reasoning behind why a novice runner would be looking to undertake this challenge might be interesting.

Last year I completed, alongside a friend and colleague, a different take on the popular and well known (to UK locals anyway) [3 Peaks Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Three_Peaks_Challenge) \- but with an added twist. Instead of driving between the mountains we cycled between each of them through some of Britain's most mountainous regions, covering 480 miles as well as summiting the peaks themselves in 3 and a half days.

While I have a history of strong road cycling and have always maintained a good level of general fitness this was my first multiple day endurance event of any kind and I loved it. We put in some serious hours training in the months leading up to it, and successfully completing it alongside raising a good chunk of money for charity was a thrill I was eager to repeat this year. However I decided, rather than sticking to what I am confident with (cycling), I would branch out to another form of exercise I was once very fond of, but had fallen out of love with. Running.

So with all that babble over with I've some questions regarding this challenge and advice as a relatively inexperienced runner and an absolute novice at anything approaching an ultra distance run. I started towards the end of last year mixing in sprint sessions and and some short runs throughout the week alongside my gym routine to build back up a base level of running fitness, and was running a few times a week. However I decided it was time to commit to a proper plan and am currently just about to start week 4 of proper training (please see link below) . There's a few areas I've listed below that I'd appreciate any advice or tips about. 

**1: Training Plan**

* *Looking to base my training plan off* [this](https://trailrunnermag.com/training/training-for-your-first-ultra-over-50k.html) *- Any comments or thoughts on this particular plan would be appreciated*
* *Any advice for recommended training regimes (either additional or instead of the above)*

**2: Reality**

* *What would realistically be the earliest I would be in a fit state to undertake this challenge with a good chance of successfully completing it? (If I followed an appropriate plan)*
* *Is this an unrealistic goal...?*
* *Is splitting this across two days likely to make it harder?*

**3: Advice Sources**

* *Good Youtube Channels or Books?*
* *Especially keen to read up on Nutrition, Hydration and Stretching to avoid injury.*
* Gear reviews?

**4: Comments or Thoughts**

* *I'd appreciate any thoughts or comments in general about the entire endeavor from those with more experience on the topic than me!*

As I mention above I'd welcome anything outwith what is asked for the in the four points above. I appreciate it's a serious goal to be aiming for especially coming from my background but I hope that with some serious work and an intelligent training plan I'll be able to manage it. Happy to engage in the comments and let me know if there's any other information you think would be helpful to know.

Thanks in advance.

* **Sex:** Male
* **Height and Weight:** 5.ft 11 &amp; approx. 78 kgs/172 lbs

I run in these at least a couple times a week and have done 3x 50-60k races in them.  Did 22 miles in a pair yesterday.

They're Amazon's house brand (Peak Velocity), I originally found them during a daily sale for $30 or so but the camelcamelcamel price history showed they regularly dropped lower.  Bought my first pair for $13.49, ended up getting the next two for $11.34 each.  ~$36 for 3 pairs is a fantastic deal IMHO, I have some pricier branded shorts (Rabbit, Nike, etc.) and these don't have any measurable deficiencies when compared side by side.  I'm partial to the 2-in-1 (boxer liner) vs brief, but they have both in multiple inseams.  I went for the 9"" inseam, I like a long short for ultras.

Fairly seasoned at the middle-ultra distances (about 10 years of up and down amounts of training) and have been a long time mid-packer for a while.

Now when I try to limit my intake I end up bonking on relatively easy runs just because I didn't re-fuel properly after the last run. 

How do I balance running a caloric deficit to slowly get back to my leaner weight, while also giving myself the calories needed to train hard?

It's free to download so I think it's okay to post here, but let me know otherwise and I'll take down the post.

A big problem I had when going for runs was always running the same route. There's a couple reasons this is a problem. I was never a good track runner because I would get bored and focus too much on breath which would make things much more difficult. The same goes for running the same route over time. The other problem is that making a new route can be tedious using online distance measuring tools.

So, I made this app as a way to solve these problems. The app starts at your current location at finds routes at distance ranges that you specify around you. It's not perfect by any means, but usually after a couple generations, I'm happy with what it gives me. I'm willing to answer any questions and I'm very open to suggestions on how to make it better for all of you! Thanks so much for the read!

I cannot wrap my head around this advice. Whenever it's hot, I cannot cool down by sweating alone, because:

* As a 170 lbs male, my stomach cannot absorb more than 16 oz per hour, 
* My skin can produce even less sweat, so my fingers get all swollen up like sausages

This is why I have some cold water bypass my stomach and sweat glands: I pour it over my head instead. I do drink some water of course.

I currently do most of my running on fairly flat pavement, but I get out to the mountains when I can to grind out some vert. I do have a set of trails close to home, but the vert is about 15-30 m depending on which of the trails I climb (2 hills, seperated by a river)  
  
How much vert should I shoot for in a week where I am running 120 km? I don't mind just grinding out hill reps, there are different steepnesses, and varying lengths that I can run to shake it up, but I am trying to find a balance between just grinding hills and actually running.  
  
My sustained uphill pace is terrible, and obviously it won't change overnight, but I would like to increase it. I do throw in hill sprints for ~15 seconds at a time  semi-regularly.  
  
I am aiming to do the Canmore Quad before the end of summer (4 peaks, 53 km +/-4900m) Should I be aiming for 3000m, 4000m of vert in a week? I should mention, I do have a treadmill, so I CAN crank it up to 12% and just grind uphill, and I have considered adding that in one night a week a few hours after a regular run.

Legs feel fine afterwards, I did bring precooked pasta with ketchup in a plastic bag, not pictured since it looks and tastes nasty. But I needed carbs, so I saved that for the 35K mark.

I'm looking to pick up a new pair of shoes and was hoping to pick your brains for advice. I just wore out a pair of Altra Timp 1.5's and was generally very happy with them.  Prior to those, I wore Topo Ultraventure's. I like the drop and fit of both, so I guess I'm looking for something with lower drop and wider toe-box.

ultrarunning,brynuh,"Recommendations on shoes, training, etc","Hello everyone! 

I’d like to preface this by saying that I compete in endurance racing with horses (50-100 miles). I know how to make a horse fit, and how to make its rider fit. I also used to race a road bike, and although I quickly fell out of love with that, I loved being fit for it and am still an incredibly competitive individual. For running on the other hand, I would like some advice. 

I keep running into a few issues regarding my feet. I was originally dared to run a race called The Devil’s Run (6.66 miles) and so I trained for about a month and it was a piece of cake. I was kind of hooked after it, too. My ankles and knees, however, began bothering me around mile 5. The New Balances I wore were road running shoes, but more along the casual side. I decided to stick mostly to trail running so I didn’t have to run on any crowned roads and I was fine until about mile 10. I left my max training distance around 10 miles for a few months. I’m used to riding my horses in Salomons, but the soles are quite hard and I liked the cushion from the New Balances. I explained this to another runner and they recommended Hokas. 

Two separate pairs of Hokas with a 5mm drop tore my feet apart. Completely. Like, to shreds after only 3 miles. This ended up setting back my training and driving my OCD and eating disorder insane. So, I hopped back on the road bike to cross train while my feet healed. 

Yesterday I completed my first (unofficial) half marathon in a pair of older Salomons that I love. I’ll admit, my blisters weren’t perfectly healed to begin with, and so the one opened up again. 

I recently purchased a pair of Salomon S-Labs, which I haven’t run in yet, but I notice they have much less of an arch than I’m used to. 

Some people preach for a zero-drop shoe, but my feet are wimpy and have a natural arch to them. My ankle caves inward when I wear shoes with no arch, and that worries me to even try running in them. They’re a normal width as well. Some people have recommended Topos, Altras and Brooks. 

With the future goal of mine to be running the Vermont 100 (km, not miles) in 2021, what are your favorite ways to cross train? How many miles do you normally run a week? How many rest days do you give yourself? 

Also, what kind of diet do you maintain? On trail snacks?

ultrarunning,jakubdr,Max cushion shoes and fatigue,"Hello,

during the quarantine, I have started doing more long and slow runs as an experiment to see how it will affect my performance during ultra runs. Basically I started trying to be “on my legs as much as possible” both running and hiking.

During my longer runs (20-30k), I started to notice that max cushion shoes actually cause more fatigue in my legs than standard/medium cushion shoes. E.g. Hoka Speedgoats (around 30 mm cushioning) cause more fatigue for me than shoes with around 20-19 mm cushioning.

I have yet to test this in an ultra run/race but I am curious about your experience. I don’t think that it is caused by the difference in drop, but it seems to me that it might be somehow related to the ground feel (e.g. the shoes with more ground feel pass this information to the legs and the step and shock absorption is different).

What are your experiences in running ultras in medium cushion vs max cushion shoes? My assumption was that max cushion shoes leave the legs less beat up (and thus I ran all my ultras in max cushion shoes) but now I am starting to think otherwise.",1589875241

ultrarunning,TylerCAndrews,Chaski Book Club - read along with your favorite pros!,"Heya Fellow ultra-runners!

Your friendly resident pro and book nerd here to announce that I've finally tackled my life-long goal - no, not going to the Olympics - starting [**a book club**](https://www.chaski.run/post/welcome-to-the-chaski-book-club)**!**

We're trying to create ways for runners of all levels to engage with each other, share ideas, and connect from around the globe. The book club is just one of many ways we're planning to do that. And honestly, I'm just a nerd and love to read and talk about books and so this is just a fun project for me.

We'll announce a book each month, suggesting manageable weekly chunks and lead guided discussions each week via the[ **Chaski Facebook Page**](https://www.facebook.com/chaskiendurance/)**.**

The first book will be:

**“What I Talk About When I Talk About Running” by**[ **Haruki Murakami**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)**.**

**Why?** It’s a short book (only 193 pages) and a wonderful memoir of a fantastic writer who’s also a passionate, long-time runner.

We'll give you time to get the book and the **first discussion will begin on Monday, May 18 (it's done via text comments, so you'll have all week to read and discuss).**

You can[ **register here**](https://www.chaski.run/book-club-signup) to receive only Chaski Book Club updates or subscribe to the[ **Chaski Blog**](http://chaski.run/blog) to receive all Chaski content (bookclub included).

**How will this work?**

Each Monday, we’ll create a new post on the[ **Chaski Facebook Page**](https://www.facebook.com/chaskiendurance/), which will include that week’s chapter(s) to read and discussion questions to think about.

You can read at your own pace over the week and then reply to the discussion questions (via a comment on that week’s post) with your own thoughts, read over the thoughts of the rest of the group and - hopefully - learn something new from everyone else’s ideas and engage in some real conversations.

If you’re arriving late, or want to easily go back, you can see all the Chaski Book Club posts and discussions in one place by viewing[ **#ChaskiBookClub on Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/chaskibookclub)**.**

We plan to read 1 book per month (though some longer books might have to be split) and at the end of each book have a live video-call discussion with whomever wants to join to talk about the book as a whole, get your feedback, and announce the next book.

**What’s the catch? How much will I have to pay? Will all the books be about running?**

The catch is that we’re a bunch of nerds that like to read :)

You’ll never have to pay a dime for the Chaski Book Club. We do, however, believe in supporting artists and writers, so please buy their books.

No, we'll read some running books, some books about other aspects of sport or endurance, and some books that seem to have nothing to do with running at all but someone suggested it or it seemed relevant. That said, we're all runners and will likely end up talking about all these books through the eyes of endurance athletes.

Hope you'll join me -- see you out there!

Love,

So I have noticed that when I’m tired (usually at the tail end of a long run with a lot of climbing, so I’m running downhill), I tend to drag my feet a bit when I’m running. Or just don’t lift up my toes enough? This leads to me tripping sometimes and having some pretty epic face plants. Usually I can catch myself before I lose my footing, but other times... not so much. 

Does anyone have any ideas for exercises I can do so that when I’m tired I don’t default to shuffling so hard that I’m eating shit and bruising elbows/knees fairly regularly? Thanks in advance for any advice you may have :)

ultrarunning,nathOF,Training For 50,"My first ever long distance race was supposed to happen tomorrow, instead it was cancelled and switched to a virtual race. Bummed out, I decided early on to keep up with training, and knew that running at the moment wasn’t about the races. For me it was the person in me I’d be leaving behind with each training session I decided not to skip, each hill interval I didnt bitch out on, and each stride that pained me to move forward on long weekend runs. Just sharing some thoughts I had reflections on before heading out tomorrow to attempt my 50 mile distance. This thread has helped me immensely along the way. Hopefully someone will read this, like I read many of your posts 16 weeks ago. 

**Things I started to love training for the 50**

-the soothing sound of the wind passing over your ears
-crunch of the dirt on the trail
-the rustling chorus of tall grass and tree leaves
-saying hi to people on the trail
-slow reveal of a tree line on the last part of a hill climb
-the city of san francisco, the little green nooks and crannies. They kept the wild alive
-learning that pain is part of the experience. Pushing through it is a mental game
-the reconciliation with the self after a long hard run
-learning not to listen to your mind, following the heart when you want the comfort of quitting 
-the childlike feeling it brings to run wild on the trail
-the constant feeling, an affirmation, that the act of running is exactly what I am supposed to be doing at that exact moment",1589563471

I'm looking to get into ultra running. I have ran a full marathon x1 (3:50), half marathons (1:37-1:55), in the past five years. I was a college cross country runner (5000m) eight years ago. 

So I've done several distances with race experience. Yet, as I start to think about training for a 50k/50 miler, I have no idea where to start. 

Right now, I am seven months postpartum, and clocked my first half marathon two weeks ago at 2:14 of running very easy, feeling really good afterwards. 

But now I'm not sure where to go from here? Since the pandemic has altered many race schedules, I'm looking to complete the distance of 50km/miles without the race day platform. I'd like to progress my training based on my current ability and my previous experience.

Any help would be WICKED guys.

ultrarunning,mdealto,I'm having the hardest time deciding on a running vest... Help!,"Hey all,

I am in the market for a running vest/pack. I have never had one before but more and more I think it will be something I love once I have one. I have read MANY reviews on all kinds of packs but I just feel overwhelmed now and need some help from a great community!

Here is what I am looking for:

\- I have not ventured into ultra-running territory yet but I intend to start soon (I should write a whole other post asking for help with that!) so I want someone versatile that can handle many situations.

\- I am a husband and dad and I intend to use this pack on short family hikes so I need something with some volume.

\- I am also a XC coach and would love a pack I can carry with me as I race all around the courses cheering on and coaching athletes ( I never carry a pack at the meets because all mine bounce too much but that usually leaves me VERY thirsty as I yell at my runners to stay hydrated...)

\- So basically, something that doesn't bounce (like at all), is durable enough to withstand long hikes/trail runs, and can hold a decent amount of stuff while not feeling huge (for meets, long hikes, and family activities).

REI is having their annual anniversary sale starting tomorrow so I plan on buying one then. Here are the 3 I am torn between:

\- Ultimate Direction Mountain Vest 4.0: Tons of pockets and decent volume. I'm wondering if it would work well when NOT loaded up. I know you can cinch the back down so that's promising. Sometimes I would not need as much and other times I would need a lot. 

\- Ultimate Direction Ultra Vest 5.0: Love the look, solid pocket options. My only concern is that it would be a bit small for long hikes if I want to bring my camera along as well. Also, when I tried one on, it felt SO LIGHT that it almost felt too flimsy? Maybe that's a good thing once you get running!

\- Lastly, Salomon ADV Skin 12 Set: I have read A TON about this pack. I tried one on and it really did feel like a second skin. The pocket layout seems great although I kinda like the smaller pocket options on the Mountain Vest. Seems like all the pockets on the Salomon would take a bunch of stuff and things could get mixed up. 

At REI right now, the Mountain Vest 4.0 is only $116 and with a 20% off coupon, even cheaper. The Ultra fall in in the middle because it is their 5.0 and the ADV skin is a lot more expensive at $165.

As good as the Salomon is, is it worth $40 more than something like the Mountain Vest?

As you can see, I need some guidance. Any advice?

My question is how do you break up that last 65% of aerobic volume? Is the sport specific training included in that? The book suggests two days of rest which I understand is flexible, but with only two days of running left both of those runs will end up being longer than the ""Long"" run that was 25%  of weekly volume.",1589240983

Hello everyone!  I just got back into running a couple months ago after reading (and watching documentaries) about trail running and ultramarathons.  With that being said, I’m looking to get my first Garmin running watch (OR Polar Vantage V) and was curious to see what you all would recommend.  I’m interested in the Polar Vantage V or Garmin 245, 945, and the Venu.  Not sure if the Fenix would be overkill for me.  

I am pretty active with running and weight lifting - I average anywhere between 4-6 workouts per week.  My goal is to run an ultra by 2023 (this gives me a couple years to adequately train, considering I’m starting from not running much at all other than some moderate post lifting cardio).

I've often found it difficult to find brands by the different types of shoes/boots/sandals they make, so the website includes filters to help you find the brands that make what you're looking for.

So far, you can filter by types of shoes, activities (casual, running, hiking etc), sex and key features.

I'm at the start of my journey in learning how to build websites and I've *tried* to make it at simple to use as possible. I hope it provides at least some value back to you bunch of awesome people.

I get numbness in my toes when I do hard speedwork. It seems like it only happens when I'm well in excess of my lactate threshold. I didn't realize this was unusual until today when I made a post regarding this in a social media running group, and now I'm even more perplexed. I've been wearing the same size Altras for the better part of a decade, so let's exclude the possibility of my shoes being too small/tight. This only happens during intervals, not even tempo runs. It seems to start at the very tips of my toes and work back toward my heel. It is not particularly more noticeable in either side (left or right). I can't recall if it starts in my big toe or pinky toe, but it starts at one side and spreads. Usually when I do my recoveries between my intervals, feeling comes back. If I walk instead of easy run, feeling comes back faster. In my mind the numbness is proportional to lactate buildup in my calves, but I don't know of any mechanism for this. Obviously the numbness isn't a life-changing issue, I'm just mildly concerned there might be an underlying cardiovascular issue.

I’m coming to the group for possible ideas for a fundraiser, especially if someone has been involved in anything like this before. 

Every year St Jude does a big fundraiser during the summer that involves multiple runs starting from different cities and ending in Peoria, IL. The fundraisers are generally straightforward and easy to do - local 5ks, parade collections, etc. This year is different for obvious social distancing reasons. 

So I’m trying to be creative, and have decided to run/walk in my local neighborhood for 48 hours to see how many miles I can accumulate. I’ve never done anything like this before and I’d like to see if anyone has experience or ideas for making it a success. 

So far I have a few ideas - 1) pledge an amount per mile, and I’ll collect after it’s all over. 2) people can donate a fixed amount of whatever they feel comfortable.  3) people can buy a “guess” of how many miles I will complete, and the closest person gets 50%, with the hope that whoever is the winner would donate back that half (I’m not trying to be greedy, that just seems to be the norm in our community). 

My friend that is also doing this with me had some other ideas, but were struggling to come up with the best - like maybe during the run if someone wants us to run in a speedo for an hour they’d have to donate X amount.

I smashed my old 935 and I'm back in the market for a new watch. My general requirements are

1. 12+ hours of battery life
2. Some kind of integrated music, preferably spotify integration
3. ability to pair with HRM with reasonably accurate GPS

So is the 945 worth the extra 200? I saw the 245 doesn't have an altimeter, that's not a big deal to me. I assume the general elevation profiles are accurate to within 10%, and its not like I train with elevation in mind either. I'm also seeing the 245 has an advertised 24 hours of battery life, is that true? I figure if I ever do a race over 20 hours I'll just bring a portable battery around, so the 945's extra 12 hours isn't a huge winner there either

I'm guessing the only other difference are metrics. I've always thought stuff like body battery was cool, but I generally don't wear my watch all day and definitely not while I'm asleep.

Afterwards, I thought the reason was dehydration, but at the time I had no idea what was going on and my brain wasn't working too well. Well, that sucks. Move on to today.

I attempted a solo 50 miler today with the help of my dad crewing me. 2 new 20oz water bottles accompanied me, with sports drink mixed in. Same nutrition strategy as the 100k (about 300-350 calories an hour), and a new hydration strategy of 20-30oz of water an hour, plus more in aids if I felt like it. It was very tough, mostly because of normal ultra things (dead legs, heat, stomach), but none of that caused me to pull the plug. My dad let me know at mile 27 that my lips were turning blue and I was shivering a bit. Not as bad as before, and if it was a real race I would have kept going, but it was not great to learn. I don't think I was deficient on any nutrition or hydration, and my training was pretty solid, so I'm stumped.

So I guess my question is, does anyone have any type of experience with this type of thing? I haven't heard of many other runners with severely low oxygen levels, and I'd really like to get this solved so I can be confident about running 50 miles+!",1588708819

Wondering if anyone can give me their thoughts on my training plan? As it stands right now I am training for my first ultra (58k 1.6k climb) which has been moved to September, from May due to COVID. Until lockdown in the UK is stopped, I want to tick over my fitness but continue my weekly mileage to be at a decent amount.

In terms of training structure, please could you let me know if it seems okay? Anything you'd add/removes? One thing I'm cautious of is some S&amp;C work, but gyms are shut at the moment! I'm hoping Yoga will help with that.

With regards to increasing the distance by no more than 10% each week, which you will see is just over 10% right now, that's because my normal long run is 25-30k, I just want to maintain fitness and build slightly.

I decided to FINALLY go out solo just because. I technically just tapered my week and extended my 'long run' by tacking all the miles I usually run onto one session.

The route I ran was relatively flat with elevation gain really not reaching over a few hundred feet. I basically followed a river bank. There was no one about and it was nice being away from people and things. Weather was cool, 20 miles in the sky opened, I got soaked to the skin (not an issue as I have run wet before). I kept going because stopping equal getting cold. Oh, then the hail arrived. Great, thanks weather. 

Bit of blister pain on my left little toe, but I had that with my 100km last year so I know I have to size up my shoes before my next race. Today was a good reminder that last year wasn't just a one-off. A few aches and pains, but nothing unexpected.

ultrarunning,aVHSofPointBreak,Advice on running a half marathon everyday for 10-12 days,"Hi r/ultrarunning,

I'm not sure if this counts as true ultrarunning, but I thought this would be a good place to seek advice. I'm in the process of searching for an actual coach, but in the meantime, I'm curious how some of you might train for a particular feat.

I'm planning an international trip, and will be running around 12-14 miles a day for about 10-12 days straight (I'm still mapping it out, so I don't have the exact daily mileage) and curious how you would approach training for this. The trip is about 12-15 months away, so I do have some time to prepare.  The climate is similar to the one I live in, and there isn't ins't any extreme elevation gain, so I'm not concerned about those aspects.

I've been running for 15 years and I'm in good health. I currently run about 5-6 days a week, averaging about 30 miles per week currently. I've run marathons before, and average about 45 miles a week when I'm in training for those.  

Speed isn't really a factor here; my main concern is remaining injury free during the training as well as the actual event.

ultrarunning,pipecreekpirates,Share your Worst (or most hilarious) Race Story,"We're all (mostly) hanging out inside for the majority of the day at this point, and thought it'd be fun to reflect on some awful or funny race stories!

Mine was at a local 8k road race that was widely seen as the season opener.  I had trained a ton all winter and had been absolutely ITCHING to race.  Of course, I wasn't the only one.  8k is a short race relatively speaking, and I thought I could ignore my coach's advice and go for a negative split.

I thought ""hey, let's just go with the flow of the pack and see how that pans out"".  

I felt great out the gate, and so did 90% of people out there, apparently.  I came through the first km in about 2:48.  This is about 35 seconds faster than the race plan that my coach had made. Sheer horror when I looked at my watch  and it was a shared emotion since the pack I was in, about 10 people, were all looking around.

I won't go too in depth, but we all fell off that pace.  At the end, our pack had almost stayed together, but were in various states of disrepair.  At the finish line, one of the guys had pooped his shorts and it was running down his leg as he lay on the grass almost motionless, another guy was sitting against a tree and puking on himself and one guy was taking a leak in full view of many people, in the middle of the grass.  

I've never hit a wall so bad. I don't remember the last 2 km but apparently I split a 5:20 on my last one.  

The finish line looked like a warzone and the only picture the local newspaper decided to print was of the bodies collapsed at the finish, and myself front and center, face completely visible, with two very crossed eyes and mouth totally hanging open.  My claim to fame!

ultrarunning,SharpCasual,Looking for the best 'unsupported' Ultra Running Pack,"Hi all,

As my training distances start to approach the limits of the 3 litres of water I carry in my Camelbak Lobo bladder (which is excellent), and I can feel the need to carry calories with me, I'm starting to plan my next pack purchase.

I'm hoping to keep training 'unsupported' and a few of the events I'm interested in also have minimal support so carrying enough water to finish a run, and still have some in reserve is a big priority. The Lobo unfortunately doesn't have front pockets, nor do the other Cabelbak 3L packs. The seemingly ever popular Salomon vests have plenty of storage in the front, but only a 2L bladder space in the back.

I'm looking for something to carry at least a 3L bladder in the back, storage for gels/water in the front. Also, does anyone run ultra distances with a rigid frame pack? Like those used by MTB riders? I like the idea of them, but wonder of the smaller contact area might cause rubbing?

About 60 degrees leaving Mill Creek at 7am. Ran the PCT west past Mount Gleason (6,520') around Messenger Peak (6,015') then back up to Mount Gleason and back down the old Mount Gleason Road to the parking area. I was three miles short so I continued on down the PCT on the other side of the lot, then back again to get the 50K. It was about 85 degrees by the time I returned (felt like 105).

Some background: 
I'm trying to stay under 10% mpw increase, and we'll under as the mileage gets higher. Trying to keep my long run under 30% of weekly volume.
Due to time constraints, I think a 12 mile weekday run is the max I could fit in. 
Thursdays I was going to do a bit of speed work, fartleks, hills, something but not too strenuous or planned.

Like many, I can't do that right now. A couple weeks ago, I bought a treadmill which allows me to map a route out and run it with streetview, if it's available. The incline on the mill adjusts to mimic the elevation profile of the route. I generally don't like treadmills, but I am finding this running streetview thing to be pretty entertaining. In fact, I'm finding that I'd rather run an interesting route on the mill instead laps around my hood. 

Anyway, my question. All of y'all who use google maps and streetview for planning runs, do you have an interesting trail or road route you know about that has streetview? I'd love to expand my list of routes to run. My favorite three finds so far:

1. With a couple of little gaps, the whole Hardrock course is on streetview. 
2. The Black Crest trail starting/ending at Mt. Mitchell NC is streetviewable. brutal and super pretty.
3. There are a couple very nice hilly loops in Henry Coe State Park outside San Jose CA.",1587387404
ultrarunning,Thelibertyexpeirment,Balancing cross training + long trail runs,"Hi guys,

This sub has always been a massive help for everything I know about ultra's and training, so it would be really appreciated to hear your thoughts/experience with my current situation. 

Quick background: Last year worked my way up from road marathon to doing 2x 50km trail races in the alps, ended up spending the majority of my weekends on Chamonix trails, peaking @ 100km/week for my first 50miler in Oct, but unfortunately ruined my ankle a week before. Realistically I think my comfortable week is 30-40km easy flat miles with then at least one 20-30km on proper mountain trails.

For Jan-Mar I tried to learn from my mistakes and ramp up slower, holding 40-60km/week. If I am honest I wasn't feeling super strong... still a bit unsure of my ankle so treated myself to decent roadbike and have now ramped up to 300km/week riding, with 1 or 2 10km road runs thrown in-between. 

I know ultimately is always an experiment of one, but would be very useful to know what other people have done. On the bike I can really push myself and the volume whilst still feeling fresh - something I struggled with when running. I have been used to seeing things like your longest run shouldn't be more than 25-35% of weekly volume, but how does this translate to non-running miles?

TLDR: My favourite part of running is the long days out in the mountains, doing 30km with 1500-2000+m elevation. Is it healthy/sustainable to keep these whilst swapping out a large chunk of my week for hours on the bike?

A few weeks ago, right before the pandemic really picked up, I relocated to my in-laws in the countryside. I kept increasing my mileage and felt great. But in this new area, every run is hilly. I love hills, and I always feel strong and efficient on the uphill portion. But on the downhill portion, I feel like I'm running a bit awkwardly.

It's gradually gotten worse, and now it's at the point where I can't really brush it aside because it hurts just walking around. On my tempo run today, I was able to give a good fast effort on the flats/uphills, but during my cool-down afterwards I literally had to walk the downhills because of the pain.

What could I have done differently to prevent this? Is it just a matter of too much/too soon? Or if it's a form issue what can be done about it?

To start off let me state, I'm not a big runner. I've ran 1 ultra, a 50K with 5,500ft of elevation gain. Other than that today was my longest run. I'm an avid thru hiker though. I've ran about 300 Miles in the Speedgoat 2s, hiked a few hundred miles (not on thru hikes) and for some reason have bouldered up to V4 in them. I love them for running, very cushiony, and fit very well. No breaking in what so ever and never had a problem with them. I was nervous to switch to different shoes because I've always stuck with one pair that I like (for thru hikes that'd be the La Sportiva Ultra Raptors). 

But unable to get SG 2s in my size I bit the bullet and bought the 4s.
I ran 12 miles today in them and let me say, they're incredible. The main two differences i noticed is the foot box and the sole. The foot box is a tad wider and the sole isn't as squishy/soft, it may because it was the first day on them but it felt a little more solid which I didn't think I'd like but I did and it felt much more grippy than the 2s when I first got them. Altho I didn't do any vert today at all. 
You'll notice in the photos I have leuko tape on my feet, I read that the tongue can cause rubbing and chaffing/blisters so I tried to be pre-emptive and beat that. After my 12 miles I don't think that would be an issue. Tommorow I'll run without leuko tape

After only a week of fundraising and throwing this event together, my compadre and I were able to run 10 loops for a total of 41.6 miles in conjunction with the Backyard Quarantine Ultra by Personal Peak Endurance.

We raised over $1,500 mostly advertising on my IG page and word of mouth. That blew our minds! We thought we’d get 10 pledges and maybe make $300. This is so much better!

My personal recap:
We decided to do the event outside instead of on a treadmill. This might be why I never had a low. The end of each loop was satisfying, almost like finishing a mini-race every hour. We only stopped because we promised each other we would after 10. We both went into this relatively untrained and didn’t want to risk an injury. Running is something we do not want to lose right now, no matter what.

### Training
Not nearly enough.

In all seriousness, though, this was my first ultra. I'd trained for an ultra before, but had to withdraw from the race because I wound up getting an interview for graduate school on the same day. Now I'm going to that school where I interviewed in their physician assistant program and my school responsibilities more or less set my training plans on fire. I'm positive that I ran more often than I logged, but Strava only shows 4 runs between October 28th and race day. Not a great look, I'll admit.

### Pre-race
Up and at 'em early in the morning because the course was about an hour drive from my apartment. My alarm went off at 5 a.m. and I peeled myself out of bed for some maple and brown sugar oatmeal, a banana, and black coffee. I took a little time to sit on a heating pad and relax before my Big Day Out™. On my drive to the course, I threw on some loud, fast music ([Propaghandi, for anyone curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqWsreZl_dw)) to get hyped.

### Race
It was the Chicago suburbs in December, and no surprise to absolutely anyone who has every lived or visited, it was windy and cold. Thankfully, we hadn't had much snow at all so the ground was dry. The race was an out-and-back run (x4) through one of the local forest preserves, but ran on a lot of paved trail - no bushwhacking or fun single-track here. I put in my headphones and hit play on my audiobook of *The Calling: A Life Rocked by Mountains* by Barry Blanchard. On long runs, my go-to entertainment are stories about suffering.  
  
I found a pack of people to run with, including quite a few other first timers. Having people to run with helped a lot more than I expected since its something that I almost never do in my day-to-day runs. Even with the extra motivation of people around me, though, I wound up power walking a good amount of the last two laps because of my non-existent training.

Big props to the race volunteers who manned the aid stations and kept me warm with broth and coffee and handed out celebratory jello shots during the final lap.

### Post-race
I was optimistically hoping for a sub-7 finish even without any real training, but honestly just not DNSing or DNFing was enough for me by the end. I drove the hour back home (holy cow was I stiff after sitting in the car for an hour after that) and took a long, hot bath to warm myself back up. I'm pretty sure I had a bit of frostnip because it took a good 2-3 weeks before I had all of the feeling back in a few of my fingertips.  
  
I took the next few weeks off from running completely since I still had work for graduate school to keep me busy and was traveling to visit family during the holidays. I'm back to running more regularly now and will be finishing my degree in a little over a month, so hopefully that means that I'll be able to give a proper effort for an ultra sometime in the next year or so after the pandemic is less pandemic-y.

ultrarunning,Norrisjf,How do you manage other doing other sports while training for ultras?,"Hello!

I’ve been doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu for a little over two years now. And because of work and life I haven’t progressed as far as I’ve wanted to. 

I’ve recently gotten into ultra running and really want to keep at it. I had to stop doing BJJ last year for about five months while I trained for my first 50 miler. 

While I loved the race, I missed BJJ, but the trainings seemed to take my body in opposite directions. For example, my hips. My hips were pretty flexible (for me) from BJJ but as my miles hit higher and higher my hips got tighter and tighter. So I stopped to focus on the running.

For reference I have been running about 45-60 mpw consistently for ~10 weeks with one week off after a 9 hour race. In the past three weeks, I have consistently had lower GI issues after 1 hour of running. Regardless of effort, vert, surface, etc. after 1 hour, I start having tons of lower GI problems (only 2 major mishaps so far, but its still not comfortable). While running I have to either stop and walk to let the ~feeling~ pass, or hop into the woods. I have not changed what I eat/drink during runs, and it still happens even when I'm not taking in any nutrition.

I have not changed my diet at all in the past three weeks, and it consistently happens after exactly an hour. Has anyone else experienced something like this before?

Been running consistently, just not at linger distances since moving to the Houston area in 2012. Ran ultras for 10+ years in WA, so the distances don't worry me a whole lot. It's more training at 50 years old now, plus ramping up during the SE TX summer. Looking for general input and comments from the older crowd as to considerations I should plan for/keep in mind. 

I've been racing primarily 10k and half marathons for the past few years, with weekly mileage peaking around 50 mpw. I've also reincorporated strength training and some mobility work on a weekly basis. Current thought is to use the Ultraladies 50 mile plan, with base building between now and mud August. Hoping to go under nine hours, which I think this particular course will support, with a decent training cycle - and good weather.

It was a great experience, and I'd like to see how much longer I can go for these training runs. 

My question is, would it be foolish to jump to 27-28 miles next time? Do you think that making the jump to racing a 50 miler in several months would be too risky? 

The thing I want to be cautious of is that I've only been running for 10 months. While I feel like I was able to handle the 40 mile weeks in XC and track pretty well, I'm not sure if this would be too long too soon.

ultrarunning,k_nuttles,The Calendar Club?,"Hey, guys. I don't know if this is the perfect place for this post, but technically it fits and I wanted to hear other's thoughts about this. I'm sure some people are familiar with Colin O'Brady, who walked across Antarctica and rowed across the Drake Passage recently. He's promoting a challenge on Instagram for the month of April where people will run 1 mile on day 1, 2 miles on day 2, ....10 miles on day 10,...up to 30 miles on day 30. It's called the Calendar Club. Apparently Jesse Itzler, who many of you probably also know, did this earlier this year as well.

I know Colin's thing is doing ""impossible"" challenges, and normally I'm all for that. I am a fan of his. This one just seems a little irresponsible to me. If he wants to do it, sure. But encouraging his followers to do 20+ mile days for 10 days straight on top of some decently heavy weeks for the average runner. Feels like it's just asking for injuries. In the end, it's all up to each individual to have responsibility for themselves. This just seems like the kind of thing that should only be attempted by high-level ultrarunners (or long-distance hikers), and even then it's not a particularly smart choice. I'm a beginner ultra runner with just one 50k under my belt but big ambitions, and I considered it for about 2 seconds before saying hell no. I feel like it will be a net negative for morale, considering how many people will likely drop out after less than 2 weeks.

What does everyone think? Would anyone here consider attempting it?",1585684707
ultrarunning,_thelastplaceonearth,Has anyone here had a fascial release surgery and/or a stress fracture?,"Tl; dr: 1)what was your experience with fascial release surgery, and 2) what does a stress fracture feel like?

Okay, 1: I'm beginning to consider fascial release surgery for my PF (three years now). Admittedly I'm impatient, but I've tried PT, MT, chiropractic work, steroid shots, the boot, regular stretching/rolling, regular icing, different shoes, changing my gait, everything I can find on YouTube... And my long runs are still excruciating. I have two races between now and July, and I just don't see how I'm going to get through them in my current state. Also, due to the pandemic, everything is closed where I live, and I cannot see a PT, chiro, or MT. It seems like this time is crucial for me to be getting treated and making improvements, and that's not happening at all. So, once this pandemic blows over (which could be a while), I want to talk to some specialists about fascial release. It terrifies me, but I'm at my wit's end. Every time I stretch my feet, it feels like a tight rubber band at the base of my calcaneus that's rigid and just won't stretch. No, I'm no expert, but that's what it feels like. It also feels like there's something on the top of both of my feet inhibiting dorsi-flexion. So, have any runners here had the surgery? What was your experience? Give me all the deets. 

2: I think I may have a stress fracture in the foot where my PF first started, specifically, near my talus. (I have PF in both feet now). I've never had one, so I don't know what it feels like. I don't think I can go get an MRI right now because of the pandemic, and I have garbage health insurance that I'm sure wouldn't cover any of the cost. So, does it hurt all the time, or just when you run?",1585585675

I did not run for one week and then tried again to which I found that I could only run for 0.3 miles before I was in pain.

ultrarunning,ttt383626282,2-week vs 3-week taper,"Hey so I'm running a 50 miler on April 5th (by myself, race cancelled) but with everything that's been happening I'm worried that either my city my institute a complete shutdown where I wouldn't be allowed to run or that I may get sick from grocery shopping/apartment complex before my run, so I'm considering running a week earlier.

Would this be a bad idea only having 2 weeks of taper instead of 3? I'm running a modified version of Sage Canaday's 50-mile beginner-intermediate plan. I ran 70 miles last week w/ a 28 mile long run and the plan was to do 52 w/ an 18 long run this week, 41 w/ a 12 long run next week, and around 21 the last week. 

Would I be able to switch to 2 weeks of tapering without a problem and if so, what type of milage should I do the rest of this week and next week?

ultrarunning,tb877,Who's running for their mental health? Because I am.,"Wasn't really planning to post this right now, it's kind of unexpected. But I guess I'm just curious to see where this leads.

I'm not an ultrarunner. I'm probably not even 20% of an ultrarunner. But I'm clearly a (very) amateur (tri)athlete. I mostly run, but I also discovered cycling in the last years. I really swim like a dead tree though. You see the type.

I actually began endurance workouts ""seriously"" after a difficult moment in my life a couple years ago. I for sure did not know how to train at all so I was always on the fence between reasonable training and overtraining. That being said I discovered at that moment what it was like when my brain ran on ketones and (mostly) not on glucose anymore. This led me to the ketogenic diet. To be honest I'm quite new to reddit and haven't really followed a lot this sub so I'm not sure what's the general opinion here about the keto diet but I suspect it must be less negative than in some other places.

I'm actually simply wondering if others too realized that endurance sports or carb-less diets had a profound impact in their lives. I'm talking about attention problems, depression, anxiety. It's almost as if I'm a new - another - person when I train *a lot* and consistently, and/or I follow a carb-less diet. And maybe I'm mistaken, but I think I'm writing this message in the subreddit belonging to the kings and queens of metabolic flexibility. Those that push harder than everyone else, and hence might understand what I'm talking about.

For the curious out there, my neurological condition that is ""cured"" by removing as much glucose as I can from my brain is called ""[hypokalemic sensory overstimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemic_sensory_overstimulation)"". Not much is known about it, apart from the fact that it can be misdiagnosed for attention deficit disorder notably.

So, any other crazy ones among you that can't live without pushing it to their limit?",1584644392
ultrarunning,foobarfault,Does my 50k training plan seem reasonable?,"I'm training for my first 50k, which is going to be on a pretty challenging course  (7.2k vert on fairly technical trail). I'm hoping for around a 7 hour finish time.

I'm thinking of using [this training plan](https://trailrunnermag.com/training/training-for-your-first-ultra-over-50k.html) (bottom of the page). The one thing that seems to be missing is threshold runs, so I'm going to substitute a threshold run every other week on Wednesdays. I'll also probably ramp up the long runs a little more quickly than the plan does, since I'm already running higher mileage than the first few weeks of the plan. Other than that, it looks about right to my untrained eye, and the peak mileage is about exactly what I think I can handle this cycle.

Any thoughts on how I should adjust this? Any suggestions for other training plans to look at?",1584642292

ultrarunning,atxgossiphound,Heat Adaptation,"Looking for some ideas from the community...

Training manuals are full of advice for specific types of adaptations - how to target V02 max, LT, strength, endurance, etc. The methods are proven and using them in training blocks works.

This weekend I was reminded that there's one type of adaptation I haven't found a good plan for: heat and humidity. My long run on Saturday was in 80 degree/80% humidity conditions. As happens every year, I struggled to maintain a jogging pace midway through the run (whereas I cruised the same run a few weeks ago when it was in the 50s). I was well hydrated (3.5L/3 hrs, 1L/hr has been sustainable in the past) and kept up with nutrition and salts.

I live in Austin, so heat is a reality if I train in the summer and my goal races last year and this are both in Sept. Last year I sucked it up, but many of my long runs (almost all done pre-dawn, when it was ""only"" 85/80%) followed the same pattern as above: decent start, but struggles after about an hour, leading to many run-walks rather than runs and a general sense of overtraining as the summer progressed. The few days it rained and kept temps low, the runs were smooth and successful. (in other words, I'm pretty sure heat/humidity is the culprit)

Is there a systematic way to train for heat? With V02 max, short intervals once a week works. With LT, longer intervals/tempos. With strength, a hard effort followed by sufficient rest. Is there something similar for heat?

What strategies have people used to train in hot climates and race in cooler ones (Run Rabbit Run is my goal (again) this year)? 

Maybe limit exposure at first - e.g., do most workouts indoors and slowly expose yourself, similar to how we target other adaptations? Recover more?

I'm fine keeping workouts under 90 minutes in the gym if it means I'm effectively targeting a specific adaptation (I've been doing tempo workouts in the gym and have found that to be more effective than on the road/trail - harder to cheat on a treadmill :) ). But, 4 hours on a treadmill won't work for long runs... I need to find a way to adapt to the heat for those.",1584464466

That being said, I live in Florida and I found myself in desperate need of water just 16 miles in to my most recent 24 miler due to the 89 degree weather. Fortunately my hubby met me to bring me more (and some extra salt tabs) but it had me wondering if I should pair it with one of the soft reservoirs in addition to carrying the soft flasks. Does anyone have experience with combining the 1.5 or 2 L soft reservoirs with the ultra 5 set?  Would love to hear what you thought, if so.",1584404584
ultrarunning,run4love,"Grateful for ultra, all over again","Despite loving this board and coming here a lot, I'm far from what you'd call an experienced ultrarunner. I've run one 50-miler and another trail 20-miler that felt twice as hard as the shorter race. Other than that, it has all been half marathons or shorter.

But through training for an ultra, and through the conversation on this board, I was able to reorient my approach to running. Ultrarunning got me thinking about how to cover long distances, how to deploy a run/walk mix, how to stay well-fed, how to deal with weather and unusual conditions. I think of it as running in the very old-fashioned way -- running as a mode of transportation.

Today, now, I'm in shuttered in NYC. Because of my job, I have to keep going into the office at least some of the time. I'm going to lace 'em up and get out there -- with confidence. The half marathon I was training for before, never mind it. The new training program is managing my miles so I can get to work and back by whatever combination of running/walking/biking I need. I know I can do it. I know I can.

Thank you to ultra, thank you to this board, for making that possible. Everybody, stay calm. Stay together. Keep running, if you possibly can. And wash your hands.",1584373760
ultrarunning,FixedFoggles,Season planning advice,"I had a bad marathon in November, and I wasn't able to return to real training until February. I've been base building for a little over a month now, just over 30 mpw with a little speed/threshold work and ~2-4000 ft of climbing a week. The injuries aren't quite gone (but they're improving week to week) so I'd like to continue a pretty cautious build up. I think I can handle a little over 50 mpw, maybe more if most of them are trail miles. Previous max road running mileage was 45 mpw, although I frequently hiked 50-60 miles over the course of a weekend.

What are some realistic goals to set for myself this year, and how should I structure the training? I'd like to run my first 50k (or a few of them) early this summer, and do a few big fastpacking trips of 70-150 miles. Then probably switch back to road running around August for a fall marathon. I know how road runners typically train (2 goal races per year, broken into mesocycles to target different systems) but ultrarunning seems wildly different. I see people running 6, 7 races a year. How do you structure training for that? Do you follow written plans? Or do you find out how much your body can handle, and then just... do that? I'm planning to use pfitz 18/55 for my fall marathon. Can I adapt it or a similar plan for 50k training, or is there a better way?",1584321070
ultrarunning,The_Paper_Cut,What’s the deal with crews and pacers?,"Just starting to look into ultra’s here. I’ve read and heard a bit about having crews at aid stations and having pavers for the back ends of races. Are these things necessary? I ask because I’m the only one I know of personally who not only enjoys running but enjoys pushing myself to run an ultra. What does a crew even do/mean? I feel like it’d be better to do everything on your own, that way you get the full sense of accomplishment knowing “I did this and didn’t have someone help me”, or am i wrong (haven’t ran an ultra yet so I wouldn’t know).

I'm starting to dig into the mountains [:)] of information online, but have a few questions:

- Should mileage increase continue through until the taper week(s)? The Relentless Forward Progress plans peak in volume 8 weeks out and then drop until the race. This feels like an extra long taper, but maybe I'm missing something on intensity?

- Are there benchmarks/suggestions for peak long run and weekly mileage? I'm looking at a single 50k with nothing else over 25 mi and weekly volume peaking at 65 mi.

- During the race: any thoughts on pros/cons of switching out shoes or what to look for in first vs. second shoe? I've never tried this, but I could see welcoming different fit/features for the second half.

Some background:

I've been running for 10+ years, but not especially quickly. Fastest road marathon is 4:30 and my 50k trail (7k+ ft of climbing) was in the 9:30 range. I'm familiar with training cycles, periodization, and purposeful intensity, but am terrible at discipline. I also have some long course triathlon experience for endurance, but recognize these are very different sports.

Since I got accepted to the race, I've been reading a bunch of Trail Runner magazine articles and blogs, binging on a backlog of Ginger Runner videos, and bought and am making my way through Relentless Forward Progress.

Does anyone have any good resources or information of their own on how to get into this sort of thing? Training wise, diet, lifestyle, books, etc? I’m going to try to research things as much as possible online, but thought I might as well see if you guys have anything to share that I may not find online.

ultrarunning,shell_yes,Foot care during a 50 miler,"Hello ultrarunners of reddit! I've got my first 50 mile race this saturday and a few newbie questions about how to take care of my feet during the race. A little bit about me:   


I'm a seasoned ultramarathoner, and by that I mean I've hung out at the 50k distance for years. I've also done one 38 mile race but during all of these races I've never used a drop bag or addressed foot care. I moved for grad school to a new area with new terrain and ran a 50k two weeks ago that involved creek crossings. I ran the entire race in the same shoe/sock combo taking in coke and pretzels at the aid stations (my tried and true race fuel) but when I got home and took off my shoes my feet looked more horrific than I'd ever seen... Now, during the race I didn't struggle with blisters (a few formed and I addressed them, but by and large the discomfort was mild) but what I did notice was this weird patch of tough skin that developed on the ball of my foot. Towards the end of that race my feet began to ache sharply, which is unusual for me, but it wasn't anything I was about to DNF over.   


My question is.... those of you that have gone the 50+ distance... what is your foot care strategy/plan and what advice (and and all appreciated) can you offer? I know that based on my training, nutrition and foot care are going to be the determining factors in my success for this race.   


Thank you in advance and happy running! :)",1583300042

I am debating between buying a Chinese Aonijie on Amazon for less than $50 or an Osprey Duro 6. Think the Aonijie can hold up? I guess the Osprey has room to fail, but I think it would be safe for me to assume that Osprey has better QC reducing the chances of failure.

ultrarunning,Megamannoll,Pacing thoughts and advice for first 100-miler,"I'm planning to run a 100-miler in mid April (15 laps à 11,5km).

I'll give you some background to make it easier to give me advice (I have a few older posts here as well if you want more reading).

TLDR: Started running late 2016, started running Ultras in 2017 50km(6:10). Ran 1000km in total

2018: Ran a 60km(6:51) and the same 50km again (6:31/ 30 degrees Celsius so bonked and practically had to walk the last 20k) also ran a 50 miler (11:15). Ran 1800 km in total

2019: 50 km was cancelled so just ran the same 60km(6:25),  also ran 100km on a Backyard Ultra with all my laps between 44-47 minutes. 

2020: Ran the same 50 miler as in late 2018 4 weeks ago (they moved the race Dec --&gt; Feb and skipped one year) In 9:50.

So I have some thought on what would be the best strategy to approach the 100 milers. From my point of view there are two strategies that pop into my head. 

1: Do what the 100 miler guy I ran with a few weeks ago (he did 2 laps in my 50 mile course) Run a ""fast"" 50 miler and do the last 50 miles slow? 

2: Structure it like a Backyard Ultra, run 50-60 mins and then walk eat for 10-15 mins and the continue running again or do walking after every lap instead.

There are pros and cons to both, 

1: I can do a good time but also ""die"" 😆 and have to DNF. 

2: play it safe, this was really really easy for me. I never really felt bad or tired, I just had to travel home because I promised my wife I'd be home by 00, I was out of calories and we had swimming lessons with the kids the morning after. It felt like I easily could have done a few laps more.


This became longer than expected, would appreciate any input :). My goal is mainly to just finish (30hr cut off) as it's my first 100 miler, but would be nice to do sub 24 hours.",1583163470
ultrarunning,orestmercator,Can I get some thoughts on my 50k to 50 mile training plan?,"**TL;DR** \- Half marathon to 50k to 50 miler in 35 weeks (all trail). Current longest run is 14 miles. Experienced non-ultra runner who's coming back from a \~1 year hiatus from running regularly. 7 weeks into current training plan (Hal's intermediate marathon) which so far is going well and I feel great, no injuries. Unsure how to dovetail my training plans so I'm best prepared.  


I'm new to ultrarunning and was hoping to get some input on my training plan(s) from more experienced runners if possible. I'm planning to run a 50 miler on Nov 7th (Run The Rock in Bend, OR). The 50 miler is the primary goal. I'm planning to follow the 24 week plan from Relentless Forward Progress which is a pretty standard Tue/Wed/Thurs &amp; Sat/Sun plan with back to back long runs that get as long as 22 miles on Saturday and 18 miles on Sunday (for the 70 mpw plan). The longest long run is 31 miles.

I mention this plan for context, since my original idea was to follow Hal Higdon's 18 week intermediate marathon plan to get a good base going then start the ultra plan. I'm currently in week 7 of Hal's plan, ran my first trail half marathon on Saturday and felt good the whole time, except for the final climb which pretty much kicked everyone's ass. 2k feet of climbing over the whole race was pretty brutal, but an awesome challenge.

Anyway, there's a trail 50k on June 6th which is 14 weeks from now I'd like to do instead of a marathon. I've read Hal's plans are notoriously light on mileage, which makes me want to switch to the 50k plan in Relentless Forward Progress (similar format to the ultra plan mentioned above but mileage starts to get longer about mid way through for the ultra plan). However, the 50k plan is 24 weeks and my longest long run so far is 14 miles which would only puts me at week 2 for that plan. The 50k would only be a ""tune up"" training run for the 50 miler and I plan to run it pretty slowly, but I also don't want to go in underprepared. I've ran road marathons before, but the 50k would be my first ultra and first substantial distance on a trail.

Just curious if anyone has any tips, thought, suggestions? I greatly appreciate it.",1583163120
ultrarunning,Lifutas,50k in 5 days. Reality check.,"I would like some opinions. I am considering an impulsive 50k this coming Saturday, the Ozark Highlands Endurance Run. I am fairly confident in covering the distance, but I’m not confident about the 10 hour cut-off time.

I am more of a hiker than a trail runner. I have not been training for this specific event at all. I run 15-20 miles a week. Last week I hiked 50 miles over 3 days on similar trails to the race. Day 2 was 25 miles in about 10 hours. This was with an overnight pack. I have never done a trail “run” of more than a couple hours. I would be mostly hiking, but the cut-off time would require some running.

My goal is to finish injury free, within the cut-off time, with just a bit of suffering. I don’t want to be constantly chasing the pace to finish in 10 hours either. Am I crazy to think the 50k is a reasonable idea? There is a 21 mile route as well, but I really like the idea of the 50k. Is there anything besides planning and easy running/take it easy that I should be doing leading up? Any insight is appreciated.

ultrarunning,Hairy_Statistician,Orange Curtain. 24 Hours. Race report,"(Mods, feel free to delete if it's the wrong spot for this).

This is my first ever race report on a race I ran this past weekend.

The race takes plan in Cerritos, California on the San Gabriel River bike trail. The bike trail is 38 miles long, from the beach to the mountains.

The Orange Curtain race is a 6.2 kilometers out and back segment of asphalt and dirt bike path. 10 loops make 100k (60 miles), 16 loops make 100 miles. For the first time this year, there was an option for 24 hours so I signed up for it. It was going to be my attempt at 100 miles. The race started at 7pm on Friday.  It was great running weather with temps in the 60s.  

I set myself at an easy pace (11 minutes) and enjoyed the night. It was incredibly peaceful and relaxing. I got 31 miles (around 3am?) and my shoulders started to hurt. I was as if someone had hit me with a baseball bat. I switched to run-walk and kept going. I reached 50 miles around 9am and hit the wall hard. Fatigue took over and kicked my arse. My wife told me I looked like a zombie when she met me in the morning.

My better half sat me down and force-fed me for a good 15 minutes before sending me on my way. That's when I made peace with the fact I was not gonna make it to 100 miles. My feet were simply too raw at that point. The constant switch of terrain (asphalt/dirt/asphalt) trashed my feet. So I started up again at a slow pace and made it to 60 miles. My wife sat me down and ordered me to take a nap. I didn't argue and passed out for an hour.

When I came too, I decided to go back out for two more loops. 75 miles was the goal. That was brutal. Everything hurt from head to toes. To my surprise, several running friends showed up to offer their support and walk with me for a bit. That was fantastic.

TL; DR:

It was good. I really enjoyed the out and back concept. 1) It made nutrition and hydration a no-brainer. No stomach issues at any point. 2) it allowed me to have a sustained effort for the duration of each lap. 3) The support was incredible from runners, race staff and bystanders alike.

It was hard. I napped the day prior to the race but the fatigue from the night caught up with me. Unclear why my shoulders were extremely sore and stiff (still are) so my form really suffered from it. Run-walk helped. I suspect fatigue is the root cause of all this. Multiple highs and lows through the night. I was able to recognize the lows and just let it happen. The highs are always around the corner.",1583073370

ultrarunning,GoRuntheWorld,My non-runner spouse hates my spending weekends camping at ultras and doing long runs with men.,"To start I want to be very clear my husband is not a jealous man. 

I ran my first ultra recently and came back from the weekend with a bunch of new ultra running friends. This is wonderful for two reasons 1. I'm new to the area and have no local friends 2. I dont like doing back country long runs alone. 

One man I met over the weekend was already signed up for my next race so we planned to carpool and camp at the start line for the weekend. Its three hours away. Two more men that I met over the weekend have since signed up for the race so we are all planning to go together. 

My husband obviously hates this. I would also hate it if he went camping with three women though I trust him completely. There's just something kinda weird about it, right? 

I went to a womens college and haven't had male friends since high school but I can already tell that ultra running is going to mean having male friends. 

My husband works weekends so he can't simply come to the race with us, meet my new friends, and feel less weird about the whole thing. Unfortunately I dont know any women whole are going to this race who I could hang with instead .

ultrarunning,ubiquitousrarity,Nordic Track ski machine crosstraining for 50 miler- physiology and tips,"I ran a 50K on very hilly terrain in December.  I ran everything on the flat (or nearly flat) for training- didn't know how hilly the course was.  I'm slow-ish, so it was a long slog to finish the race.  Got a little burned out on long runs in the cold following the race.  Enter my Nordic Track ski machine.

What is the science behind this?  I mean, I am using my body in a different way than running, but some of the muscle groups are being trained whether I am running or on the ski machine.  What am I strengthening on the ski machine that will benefit me in an ultra?  I want to do a 50 miler in the future.  Is a Nordic Track good for core and for lower back/mid back muscles?  Those were hella sore after my 50K on hills.

Any information on how effective the ski machine is as crosstraining is welcome.  Two years ago I was out of shape and too fat to run, and I would get 3.5-4 miles in 60 minutes on the NT.  Now I am getting over 9 miles in 60 minutes- feels like a good clip and good cardio workout.  

Would NT two days and running three days every week (long runs getting up to 32 miles or so) be a good base for a 50 miler?  I am 237 lbs (still losing though) so I don't want to do back-to-back long runs yet.

Thinking about switching to handheld/s, but on the other side of that, it feels like they’d be clunky and I wouldn’t be able to use my hands (not like I need those too often, but if I need to, say, grab a snack). Or, what if I decide to use poles for a really big climb?

This seems controversial. Besides salt capsules and sports drinks, many of us just eat salty chips, pretzels and whatnot, and I think the study does not account for that source of salt. Also I don't think we lose electrolytes at the same rate - it depends on the runner, and a lot.

I am trying to redeem myself and actually train this time.

I have a 20 miler this weekend and a 50k scheduled for April. My question is, should I follow the 50 miler training plan to a T, even the week before each race or adjust it slightly to allow some room to taper the week before each race?

I'm not trying to set any records for the 20 miler or 50k, although I would like to push myself a bit this weekend as my first go with this 20 miler 3 years ago was a shit show (it was my first trail race, longest distance, and very little training because my friend dropped out the week before the race and offered me his bib.

I'll be 28 years old, with 3 marathons and 1 50k (have already run all of these) under my belt headed into the Charleston Marathon (January 16 2021). 

This year I ran the Charlotte marathon in November, and then Cloudland Canyon 50k in December, and then the Disney marathon in January. However, saying that I ""ran"" these is kind of being generous; a couple minor injuries and some family stuff left me undertrained headed into Charlotte, which led to new minor injuries, which led to really borking my knees at the 50k, which led to a \~6:30 marathon time at Disney. 

I'm taking 2020 to give myself a ton of time to heal, get re-centered, run for fun, actually learn how to trail run, and work on getting faster. In the second half of the year I'll start cranking up distances, with a goal of going sub-4 hours in Charleston. After that, I'd like to transition to focused training up into a 50-miler (which may involve another attempt at a healthier 50k beforehand). I would love any advice or opinions on how long after the Charleston Marathon to place my first 50 miler, and where to maybe stick a 50k race in between those. Thank you!

Fri/Sat/Sun are inter-exchangeable, though I'd rather keep my long run on Sat to have fresh(er) legs for my Badminton club on Monday evening. One of the weekend run will also usually have some hills training as well since all my races will have a lot of elevation.

The races are:

* Brecon Beacons Ultra: 52k, 2700m+

* Race to the Castle: 100k, ~1000m+

* Snowdon24: Going up and down Snowdon for 24 hours. 15km, 1k+ each loop.

ultrarunning,TheTimeIsNow5115,Questions on training goals/plans for running 2 50ks 2 months apart.,"Hey everyone. Super long time lurker on here. Just had a few questions regarding my goals and training plan for the coming year. Hoping people with more experience can offer some perspective.

My racing background. I have over the last several years done 10+ half-marathons, 2 marathons, and 2 50ks. Last year I completed a 50k in 6:53 (2,200 ft gain) and a road race marathon in 4:23 among several other shorter races. My training has been fairly consistent, typically hitting 4 runs a week with 2 long runs on the weekend. Although, my peak mile weeks were ~35 miles and regular weeks 20-30.

I am looking to amp up my miles just a little this year. I've got 2 half marathons planned for the spring and then a 50k with ~2200ft of gain in May, followed by a 50k with 4400ft gain in July (8 weeks later). My ultimate goal is to finish both 50ks between 6-7 hours. Just getting out on the trails and finishing are primary goals though.

My questions are, is 2 months enough turn around time to recover and keep getting in long runs to prep for the second 50k? Or am I being to ambitious and should just choose one to focus on? Any advice or tips on running multiple ultras in a season? Thanks.",1582342183

ultrarunning,allegoricalces,First 50k - Seeking advice,"I'm looking for some advice for my first 50k, to get feedback if my goal to finish is feasible with my current training and fitness status.   
The race I am training for is in 5 weeks time, has a trail race with very technical sections over 4 peaks (starting elevation: 350m, peak elevations: close to 1275m, between each of the 4 peaks around 400m downhill to bottom before going back up)

I felt prepared until I recently have had a few separate injuries, which has pushed me into more cross training. And this past weekend I trialed the first 2 sections of the race (which both have cumulative cutoffs of 2 hours and 4 hours)  where I am only just making the time cutoffs (I ran the first part in about 1hr 45, and second part 1 hour 50min - so just under 4 hours cumulatively).  Due to this I am not confident that at say, mile 30 in the middle of the race, I would be suited well for finishing within the allotted time cutoffs.    
Part of my surprise for my times I believe is I have not been training properly for the terrain (not enough hills or technical trails - which I have the option to train on in the next 5 weeks leading up to the race).

I've been training since November with this 50k in mind, but have come across the usual setback of injuries, holiday (Christmas/New Years) training slump and fitting everything into a busy schedule. I am currently training about 35 mi/week (56k/week) with max long run at about 18 miles (29k).  I am not new to running, trails or distance - just ultras.

Any advice for a first 50k?

Considering postpone my first 50k to a more feasible trail - get more training in, find a race with more flexible cutoff times and less elevation change  
Or based on current training is it feasible for completing, with more focused terrain training? - If I DNF there is no easy access to the trail besides the start or finish.  I would need to walk back out to the start/finish anyways.",1581315321

The phone is in the left side zip pocket, and in a case but otherwise “naked.”

While I'm bummed, I totally agree with the decision to protect the trails and the runners. But my question is how to add on an extra month of training. I have been tapering this week, but my reaction is to do a 20 mile run tomorrow and then go back up to 40 miles next week and maybe aim for 50 the week after before I try to begin another taper. Should I just go straight to 50 miles since I've been tapering? I'd like to get at least one or two 20 mile long runs in before the race, but I don't know how to rebound from a taper when I didn't even race, and I would hate to get an injury from doing too much. 

For reference I averaged 30mpw all of 2019 and maxed out at 50 miles around the end of november for a marathon in December. I haven't been able to get in good training due to the holidays and travel, but I have still been averaging 30+ mpw in January.

This July, I’m going to run my first 100mi/162K (10,000m+) mountain ultra (Val d’Aran by UTMB). I’ve completed 100ks before (CCC) and other ultras, but this will be my longest and toughest race yet. 

I’m integrating some other races into my training, notably an 80K urban trail in March (low elevation but for distance) and some other small, local trail races. I’m also thinking about one other that is very well-organized and with lots of elevation and similar terrain to Val d’Aran, but only five weeks before. It’s a race that I have always wanted to do, but its never fit in my schedule. It’s easy to get to, logistically, which also makes it so appealing as a ‘training race’. 

My question is, which race should I do? My options are:
1. 89K/5200m+
2. 42K/3200m+ marathon race 
3. The 89 but over two days (45 and 42 per day)

The 89K is the flagship race, and the one I REALLY want to do, but I’m afraid that 5 weeks won’t quite be enough time to recover (also mentally). It would then make sense to do the 2-day option, but the logistics seem complicated and I do prefer the 1-day format...

I also have a PhD in sports science, so I want to put myself out there for any questions!

ultrarunning,Huskerfan402,Training plan feedback for Wasatch 100,"I will be running the Wasatch 100 in September. This will be my first 100 mile race, I just finished my first 50k last week (Arches Ultra) in 6 hours. 

[I am looking at potentially using this training plan with some modifications](https://pdfhost.io/edit?doc=b25369af-07aa-4505-af0e-5ceea8ae492d)

My questions are, with the W100 being \~25k elevation gain race...

* how would I account for that elevation training as part of this plan? 
   * I am thinking of adding an elevation goal to each week between 10-20k feet
* Should I do the interval training on flat ground, or climbing on race terrain? 
* How much of my training should be on race terrain vs. flat where I can do strides/speed work? 
* This plan has me running a 50 miler 5 weeks before the race- seems like not much recovery time, I was targeting one more around 12 weeks before, thoughts? 

Any other tips from W100 finishers or 100 miler finishers as I evaluate a training plan and schedule for this year? I have access to the course for the whole year and plan to run the whole course in sections as part of the normal training.

ultrarunning,p0tato_face,Best shoes for beginner mileage levels?,"Getting back into running after 18 month hiatus. Moving to NC and SUPER excited for all the races there...did Pilot Mountain to Hanging Rock in October 18 and it was legit the best race/best day of my life. 

I was 16-17 and dumb while running before (and also broke) so I trained for all my races in the same cheap pair of Nike road running shoes. My ankles and feet were FUCKED after my training (which definitely contributed largely to an injury and me falling out of running). I wanna do it right this time. 

What are your recommendations for running shoes? I'll likely be aiming for shorter distances this year...all trail runs for sure and probably just some half marathons or possibly ~20 mile distances, unless things go well in which case I'd LOVE to do the Pilot Mountain 50K again. Not super limited in budget but also still 19 and not making a ton of money + mid move so not looking to spend a ton. 

More info: not gonna be on any super technical terrain but also definitely planning on getting out there. I won't be too far from Umstead Park so possibly those trails? You get the idea when it comes to terrain, idk. Not sure about weekly mileage either but like I said working up to at most a 50K this year. 

Other tips like if I should buy two pairs and interchange them, how often I should replace, etc would be great.  ALSO, bonus points for trail recs in the Raleigh area...",1580381580

ultrarunning,NavyBlueZebra,14 weeks between a 50 and a 100,"I'm following a 20 week ultrarunners magazine plan for my 50 mile race. It's on familiar terrain, and I'm training on similar trails. In the past I did manage to finish such races at a steady pace without pain and suffering, so I'd expect relatively short recovery, like easy runs starting next day.

I've signed up for a 100 miler 14 weeks later, which is not on familiar terrain, and there is some elevation I'm not used to. I was wondering how to adjust a 20 week ultrarunners magazine plan for 100 miles to fit into this 14 weeks period. 

So far the best option seems to keep training with my 50 mile plan, until 20 weeks before the 100. Then start the 100 mile plan. On the day of the 50 mile race, the 100 mile plan suggests a 5 hour long run, so I'll run the 50 miler instead, and take an easy week after it. 

Another option would be to follow the 50 mile plan all the way, have an easy week after a 50, and then do the last 13 weeks of the 100 miler plan. That would mean that I'll miss all the intervals and tempo runs. Only slow running between the 50 and the 100.

What would you suggest?",1580328511

Non-runner here, interested in ultras but didn't think I was nearly ready to attempt one (because not a runner). A few things I read in this sub got me thinking maybe I could do one.

Someone posted their average pace and it matched my walking/hiking pace pretty closely. Someone else posted about people who walk ultras and do well - they were described as ""ghosts"" who silently passed through aid stations.

For context, I've done extensive backpacking - overnights, day-hikes - and I've done erg-marathons (42.2k on a rower) and felt perfectly fine at the end, with more gas in the tank. I've also up and hiked or Nordic walked 30-50k ""just for giggles"" - no planning, just go.

ultrarunning,science-rocks78,Is it common to run off course in Ultra?,"I did my first 50k this weekend.   It was an unassisted point to point trail run.  The trail was difficult to follow, you had keep your head up and stay attentive.  I went off trail a few times, backtracked and got back on course.  Was psyched to finish, had a great time,  it was an amazing experience and wasn’t easy.   

The next day my friend who also ran told me how amazing it was that one racer missed the trail at some point and ran the road back, another runner lost the trail, ran on the road for a while then got into a car and got driven back to the trail.  Then he finished the race.  They both ran over the 50k, but either didn’t run the course or had assistance.   It was just a small town race, the results really don’t matter.  That being said, it’s a race.  I’m competitive, did my best, and take a lot of pride in doing it the right way.   

I didn’t find this amazing, it actually pissed me off they didn’t DQ.   They were fast and smoked me, but couldn’t navigate for shit.   I’m not into the rah rah aspect of Ultra, it’s not for me, maybe that’s why I don’t understand how this is acceptable.  The race director was an awesome guy, people were all super friendly.  

So is this the norm to not run the trail or get assistance and still be a finisher?  Can someone please explain to me why the race director didn’t DQ these guys.  Or why the two runners didn’t ask to take a DNF?  It left a bitter taste for me that it’s okay to bend the rules or not have them at all.",1580130001

I ran my first marathon December 1, and have signed up for a 6 hour trail race April 4th on a 5 mile loop course, and my goal is 30-35 miles. I spent December recovering from the marathon, and have spent most of this month either sick, or mildly injured (but still cross training 4-5 days a week). I’m hoping to get back to running more regularly next week. I’m a little stressed about how much time, and potential fitness I lost this month. 

How much is the time I lost this month going to affect me? Do I still have enough time to ramp up my mileage and taper in two months? My plan was to focus on getting used to the time I’ll spend running by doing mostly long easy runs, and maybe one speed workout a week. I also wanted to do some back to back long runs on Friday and Saturdays, maybe work up to 15 miles each day? Any advice on what my weekly mileage should look like leading up to the race? For marathon training I was around 30-35 miles a week, is increasing to at least 40-45 for the ultra enough? Is it better to focus on mileage or time spent running?

I’m on 60-odd mile weeks right now and feeling pretty good overall. I did an ease back into mileage after the marathon over 2 months. 

I’m into 6th week of self-created training plan:

Weeks 1-4 were building mileage and hill sprints; long runs being 19/11 (back to back), 22/10, 23, 20 miles. 

Week 5 was a trail 10K race, no other speed work that week. Mere 200m of vertical and placed in the top 2%. 

Week 10 has a trail marathon (1500m of vertical), thinking to take a ~2 week taper with a 18/14 back-to-back 2 weeks out. 

Week 11 (straight after marathon) is going to be a hiking/recovery week, planning to get some vertical in with some easy runs. 

Week 16 has a 50K with 900m of vertical gain. Again, 2 week taper with a 20 miler 2 weeks out and no speed work. 

Week 22 is the A-race of 55 miles and 2250m of vertical. 

My questions: 
* How should I schedule (if any) speed work? I was thinking of tempo runs until marathon, then try and get mid week runs on trails with some emphasis on going harder on uphills/downhills. 
* Shall I be less aggressive on tapering for B-races? My idea of a taper is decreased volume and no speed work, but still long run 2 weeks out. 
* Is there a benefit of medium long runs midweek? Something along the lines of 12-16 miles on road. I used to do them, but couldn’t decide if they were helpful. I wonder if spreading mileage a bit more evenly is a better idea. 
* How long should my long runs be? When I was training for a marathon, I found that first 16, 18 and 20 mile runs were much harder than the subsequent ones. The third 20 miler was much easier on both body and mind. I’m not going to do 40 miles, obviously.

I gave myself a minimum time of 12 hours, if I was on track for finishing faster than that I was probably going too fast and likely to blow up. I also didn't want to drop below 18 hours, I didn't want to be chasing cut-offs, the cut-off time was at 19 hours. I didn't know where within that 12 to 18-hour range was a reasonable finish time, obviously, I wanted to be closer to the 12-hour mark than the 18-hour mark.

## Setting off

The race started quickly, I made an effort not to get carried away, I didn't try and keep up with those around me and I let myself fall back. After 2km the trail narrowed and started climbing, queues formed and my pace was now being set by those in front of me. I understood why there had been such a rush at the start. I made a few passes where I could but mostly had to just stick with the group pace.

The first third of the race was the hardest part of the course, with the most climbing and technical terrain. At one point there was even steep scrambling that involved pulling on fixed chains. Despite the difficulty, or perhaps because of the difficulty, this first third of the race flew by.

&amp;#x200B;

[There was a short section of steep scrambling](https://preview.redd.it/5e4rghegcwb41.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8e65d5daf4085a0e94eb697066d25eae1dfdd27)

## Strengths and weaknesses

## Vertical

I found that I was much stronger than those around me on the uphills, most were slowly walking the uphills. I found I could happily power hike the steeper hills or slowly run the more gentle hills. My weakness was on the downhills, I was often overtaken by the runners I'd just passed on the uphill.

I suffered from painful soreness in my quads, for many days, following the race. I've discovered this is often caused by running lots of downhills without being conditioned to them. The eccentric contraction of the downhill is very stressful. My training so far hasn't contained very much vertical, most of my training is in Manchester city centre which is pretty flat.

## Eating

I went in planning to eat a small amount every hour, I vaguely stuck to this plan for the first half of the race. I didn't feel hungry and had to make a conscious effort to eat, but I didn't have any stomach problems when I ate. I think it's important to eat as much as you can early on in long races, while your stomach can handle it.

The midway checkpoint had a bigger variety of food and was set up as a bit of a lunch stop. I decided to eat a bit more than I had at previous checkpoints. I scoffed a couple of chocolate spread sandwiches and a bit of everything else on the table. I soon regretted eating so much, leaving the checkpoint I felt full and sluggish. I also didn't take on enough water and could tell I was getting quite dehydrated.

I found that the overeating affected me mentally more than physically, my pace didn't change drastically but I was feeling miserable. I held off eating for a while and gradually felt better. At the next checkpoint, 2/3 of the way through the course, I just ate oranges to take on some liquid, and easy to digest sugar at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

[Plenty of oranges at the checkpoints](https://preview.redd.it/9gy30odrcwb41.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0134caf0273ec10d5a2621ca148078dfe5e54d4)

## Finish

## KM 78

It got very cold leaving the 78km checkpoint, it was up at 1,000m and climbing to 1,300m and it was on the shady side of the mountain with the sun setting. My fingers got painfully cold, I stopped to put my gloves on but could only find one. I spent a long time, stopped, searching with awkward numb fingers. In the end, I wrapped my hand in my windshirt and carried on. I don't know if this demonstrates smart thinking, or if the fact that I couldn't find my glove (which I hadn't actually lost) shows that I wasn't fully switched on this late into the race.

&amp;#x200B;

## KM 84

I felt pretty good from the 78km checkpoint onwards, my stomach had sorted itself out, and I had managed to take on a good amount of food and liquid. I approached the last checkpoint with a strong plan. I didn't need to stop, I was carrying enough water to get me to the end and I didn't need any more food. That plan fell apart immediately, as I approached the checkpoint I was ushered inside. People started offering me water, I said yes, I saw the food and I started eating. I was still in and out reasonably quickly but it wasn't what I had planned.

## KM 93

I looked at my watch and saw that the finish line was just around the corner, I put on a little surge up the hill I was on, I turned the corner and entered an empty street. I didn't understand, I kept following the markers and went off the end of my GPS track. The finish line was one confusing kilometer away, I still don't know what happened, if I had downloaded an old GPS track, or if I'd missed something in the Spanish briefing (I don't speak Spanish). This confusion made the finish a bit underwhelming, I had lost my rush of excitement. Still, I was happy to have finished. I finished in 13 hours 48 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Just finished](https://preview.redd.it/zkp1wlvxcwb41.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a99c6bc1faff6a1e76a1a00c4e22b4d082d917)

## Lessons Learnt

The race was a good tester for the Northern Traverse, I learnt some important lessons. It's given me confidence in my 3-day target, I feel like the slower pace needed to complete the Northern Traverse in 3 days shouldn't be too taxing as long as I can improve my downhill ability.

## Increase efficiency through preperation

My running vest is the 2016 model of the Inov-8 Race Elite, which has small front pockets, but no large side or back pockets. Trying to access food or equipment, from the main compartment, on the go was very awkward. On the Northern Traverse, I will need to eat a lot more on the go as there are only a few checkpoints, very far apart. I will experiment with adding some accessible stretch pockets to my bag. So that I can make most of what I need accessible when I stop at a checkpoint, then I can eat or change clothes on the go efficiently.

During the GR10X I wasn't arriving at checkpoints with a clear plan, and when I did have I plan I ignored it. There will be fewer checkpoints at the Northern Traverse, but with tents, proper cooked food and warmth on offer, there's a lot of potential to lose minutes or hours if I'm not focused. I will prepare and print checklists that I can follow at the checkpoints, this will let me avoid thinking and make it easier to be disciplined at the checkpoints.

## Do more vertical

As mentioned above, my biggest weakness during the race was on the downhills, and my biggest problem I had after the race was 4 days of painful soreness in my quads. Going forward, the focus of my training will be to accrue as much vertical as I can. This will involve long runs in the Peak District on the weekend, and finding short hills, close to home, to repeat on weekdays.

I’ve been running a lot for the past few years now and I absolutely love it! I’ve ran a couple of marathons and would like to increase the distance.

The thing is that I’ve encountered a lot of injuries through my 3 years of active running while having good running shoes and using Personalized soles. But I wasn’t very smart and didn’t stretch at all. 

At the moment I’m having knee pain which my physiotherapist informed me that it is the Patellar Tendonitis syndrome. He told me I should start stretching multiple times a day which I’ve been doing excessively for 3 weeks now.

Does anyone of you have experience with this? How did you overcome this? Is stretching the key for avoiding injuries? How long did it take to heal? Did you stop running or not?",1579169420

ultrarunning,SilentMaster,Speedwork,"I have been ultra running for about 4 years.  I run 2 to 5 ultras from 50K to 50M each year.  I have been training with friends whose training plan consists of some random ass weekly mileage number we need to hit that goes up a little bit each week until we taper.  Literally nothing else matters.  Not the pace.  Not the surface.  Not elevation.  Last year I broke off from them and ran a 100 miler and I completed it, but my time wasn't anything impressive.  I really thought I was a better runner than that, so it was kind of a wake up call.  So after the 100, I was kind of out of sync with my friends.  They started training for a road half, and I was recovering so by the time I was ready to run again they were racing, and I found a trail marathon to do.  So I was left to my own devices and I kind of did a shotgun approach of speed, hills, and distance and I did really well at the marathon, even won my age group.  

So now I'm 100% convinced my running friends are idiots, and I'm training for a 50 miler in April.  I have set up a very similar training plan with increasing mileage, but a mix of speed, hills, lots of trail miles, etc.  I am in week 3 now and I've had big miles, lots of hills, tons of trails, but this morning was my first speed workout.  I can normally do repeats at speeds in the low 6's, but today my legs just weren't having it.  I know I'm tired, I ran 5 hard road on Friday, 8 hard hilly road miles on Saturday and 9 trail miles Sunday at a pretty decent pace, but I was really hoping to be able to bang out 6's for every interval I had to do today and I just couldn't manage it.  I had one good one at 6:30, but the rest were 7:05 slower.

The thing I'm really wondering is, if my goal race pace for a 50 miler is 9 minute mile average, what kind of pace for speed work should I shoot for?  If running 6 minute intervals isn't going to help me I'd rather just back it off and be happy with my 7's, but I just don't have any experience with this sort of training.  Does anyone ever run super fast while training for an ultra or am I trying to do too many different things at once?",1578918941

However ultrarunning has a history of multiday events, often involving distances that themselves are less than a marathon, and so an event that covers 5k, 10k, Half and Full in 4 days feels to me like the sort of endurance event that fits into the ultrarunning ethos to some extent.

I thought that this would make things uncomfortable and wore a tank top for my first 5 mile run. But it didn't and I didn't get cut of chaffed. So I guess it seems fine.

The other difference looks like the material isn't as porus as Salomon vest, it's a closed stretch material. There is also only one zipped pocket in front vs the two in Salomon, and the Salomon vest has ability to route the hose from bottom of the pack under the armpit up to the runner. The Aonijie is more straight forward.

In comparison to my other Peter Balkwin Ultimate Direction 2.0, it fit much higher on my rib cage, where the UD vest takes up the whole rib cage, the Aonijie stops about half way. This with combination of stretch material pulls the gear in rear storage pockets closer and tighter to middle of my back. Vs lower small of my back on UD. This allowed for no bouncing and carrying the same weight to be unnoticeable.  

The front pockets I also found really nice, compared to zippered pockets everything was just faster and easier to get to. I really like it for holding my phone it it's water resistance bag, and being able to pull it out change music, check map whatever. 

Also having the security of a zippered pocket up front is really nice just to make sure I don't loose anything. and for my keys, there is a clip in the back that also is inside of zippered pocket. 

Overall I underestimated how much something like this could allow me to move faster over terrain. MY UD vest has been awesome, but this is definitely a nice upgrade. The Salomon vest properly has slightly higher build quality and materials. However given a 100 dollar price difference. I'm not sure it's worth it. 
    Hope this helps other with their decision.",1578382245
ultrarunning,MisterIntentionality,First Running pack/vest Advice,"So I’m training for my first ultra (50k) and checking out some packs. 

How do I know what size to get? 

I want to use my pack for a 50k and a 50M. The 50k will be a radical trail with a drop bag at 12 and 22 miles, and aid stations every 3 miles however I have dietary limitations/allergies so I will be limited to water only at the stations, I have to carry my own food and liquid fuels 
I think I will want to carry at least a change of shoes and socks with me and food. 

I’m looking at two packs, both have 2L bladders but one is a 7L and the other a 12L pack. 

Is it going to be problematic to buy the 12L just incase or is it not advisable to buy a pack too big because it will move more? 

Its funny but these are the types of things I lose sleep over. If I’m dropping $100+ on a pack I want it to be the right one.

The Ultimate Direction 4.0 is one possibility, but it seems like they added a couple extra pockets that were not there on the 3.0 version which is fine but something really minimalist is fine for my needs.

ultrarunning,whatheway,Thoughts on a high/low program?,"I find I do best with 10 days of lesser runs after a longer one but I work M-F so that would mean either a week or two week range. So I tried out 10 miles as a long (even though I do ten on another day) one week and a 20 the other. I remain consistently 40-50 mpw and keep the two closer by having my longer speed and incline hike days on the 10-mile long week, but am wondering if people think I’m being stupid because consistency is a big theme. Thoughts? Is it too much of a jump to do 10 max (even if twice) one week and 20 the other?

ultrarunning,posdeam,"Thinking of revamping my approach to training to just 4 days a week with specific sessions, anyone else done something similar?","So my current approach is pretty standard. I build mileage over time without increasing two fast. I do speed sessions once a week (typically hill repeats or stuff like 8 x 800m, 4 x 400m etc). I do a long run on the weekend and when I get near the race, I do a back to back. I also try to do strength and conditioning. I tend to be training on average 6 days a week.

I am 45 years old, which I think has a lot to do with my following point. I just feel based up all the time. I am constantly riddled with niggles or injuries and feel over cooked quite a bit. 

I can't really keep this up long term, its just no fun anymore and it's feeling like a grind. Interestingly life through a few curveballs at me and I had a 2 weeks almost of running only every 2 days. The days that I did run, I felt way better and it was like allowing myself to properly recover and adapt had made quite a marked difference, it was also much more pleasurable than going out already feeling bashed out, to get the miles ticked off.

I have since then started to read about folks who train for ultras, but don't do 6-7 days a week of 60 to 100 miles. Instead they do 4 days a week with each session specially targeting an improvement, and not 'easy day' or 'recovery day' where you just shuffle round for 5-10 miles. 

It seems to be something fellrnr swears by and a few others, but I can't dig out much details, has anyone else explored this.

Keep in mind I am not saying this way of training will result in faster times, or a better athlete. If I was in my 20 to 30's I am sure I could handle high mileage daily running, but with an older body its just not going to work long term, and as much a I have just had a little whinge, I love running ultras and would like to keep at it.",1578256098

I've just recently started getting back into running, and have been doing a lot of longer trail runs (hoping to do my first 50k this spring). I really don't like holding anything in my hands while I run and was given a hydration vest for Christmas! I'm brand new to these and have no idea how they are supposed to fit.

I am *right* in the middle between medium and large according to the Salomon sizing guide and don't know which one to get all sweaty and which to return to REI. After tightening them down to a manageable amount of bounce, the medium sat very wide on my chest (but this may be intentional?) and ended about at my rib cage in straight posture. The large sat a bit more naturally on my chest (I'm quite used to wearing packs) and extended an inch or so past my ribs.

Both seem perfectly comfortable jogging around the house, so for those here with experience using these things: would you size up or down?

ultrarunning,Owlbelovely,Trail running - trying to help fiancé with our first ultras.,"I have ran four marathons and decided to take the plunge and sign up for a 50 miler. I feel ready as a runner to accomplish this and I have been running for 14 years so I’m wanting bigger challenges. My fiancé has been running for around 5 years and just completed his first and second marathons in 2019. He decided to sign up for the 50k during the same race as mine. I was actually excited about this and having a training partner...until today.  

We live in a city in a valley so we are surrounded by gorgeous trails. I run them all the time whereas he has never once ran them. I recently got invited to join a local group of ultra athletes for their weekly trail runs. In anticipation of our first run this Sunday with the group, we went to a local trail that is more of a beginners bunny hill running/hiking trail. I take off and after a bit noticed he wasn’t behind me which is odd as he is much faster than I am.  

I start to worry and turn around - he is walking towards me and looks miserable. He fell on some ice. So I called the whole thing off as he is so miserable it would have been terrible for me to keep running. I saw the spot he fell and upon tracking his prints in the snow, noticed he had no idea what he was doing. He is running straight down the trail instead of looking for the best spot to run as he went along.  

The conversation heading home was a little awkward as I didn’t know how to help him and he clearly wasn’t ready for even this kind of trail running. He mentioned he was going to wait until spring to try again which is totally fine with me! However, he also mentioned he views me as his coach and that makes me feel like I need to help him.  

My questions are: How can I help him become a trail runner in the spring and support his 50k goal without him being left in the dust? I know this seems obvious “just do it” but I don’t think this is that simple. Trail running and distance running were just natural to me.

ultrarunning,crushartifact,2020 Ultra Planning Help,"I’d like to run my first ultra in 2020 and would love the opinion of seasoned runners. A few things about me: I’ve run 26.2 miles a number of times but have never paid to run a race (I just do it on my own). I generally run 8-10 miles 3 days a week and 15-20 on Saturday. I cross train 3 days a week  and cycle in target heart rate zone one for 2 hours on my “rest day”.  I feel great with this routine and have been injury free for as long as I can remember. 

I signed up for the marathon on the treasure coast on March 1st and wanted to run the Keys 100 in mid May but I think it’s too close to the 26.2 in March. Would it be silly to run the 26.2 on March 1, the Keys 50 miler in May. And the Daytona 100 in December of 2020?  The spacing seems OK for training purposes but as I mentioned, I’ve never actually run an actual race. Thoughts?  Thanks in advance!",1577469347
ultrarunning,Hairy_Statistician,24 hours event - mental strategies?,"Next February, I'll run a 24 hours event near my hometown. The course surface is asphalt. Approximately 90% of it has a dirt path next to a bike path. The course is 6.2 miles out and back, repeated 10 times for 62 miles / 100K. ***This is a night start.***

My goal is to complete the 100K in 14 hours (13:45 min/mi average pace) and get to 100 miles in 23 hours (it's about 14:00 min/mi average pace).

All of the above looks on paper (my weekly mileage is on par) but it won't mean a damn thing if I can't keep my focus. Boredom will happen and I expect it. Here's some strategies I came up with to keep going:

* reward myself with a snack every ""back""
* count the miles backwards
* mark down every ""back""
* break the course down in segments i.e. to the tree, to the bench etc...

I'm looking for some advice. After training all year I'm going into my first 24hr race with a case of runner's knee that started developing around 2 months ago. My running has been limited in the last 3 weeks to focus on strength training hips, quads and other areas that I've heard will help with runner's knee. 

Long story short, I still get a flair up around 5 miles but it's not completely debilitating. 24hrs will be well beyond 5 miles! I need tips on how to manage and prevent the pain for as long as possible during the race. Anyone out there run ultras with runner's knee? How do I get this thing done?

ultrarunning,dowakin,"Would like to try ultrarunning, never ran more than 12km, wondering if i am too young (20years old)","So i read a book from Rich Roll, David goggins'd book and also Scott Jurek's book, and i became interested in ultra running: my athletic background for reference: i am 20 years old, i play football (soccer for americans) since i was 6 years old, i was always one of the fastest kids but decided to not train athletics and focus on football, anyways, i always loved running besides football, and i always had the best endurance in the club, but the most i ran was 12km. I was fast enough to come to high school finals where i had a time of 6minutes and 20 seconds on 2km. I also trained calisthenics till i messed up my shoulder but now i am slowly coming back, so i have no problem with hard training and pain. Oh and i am 2metres tall and i weigh around 85 kg. 
Here are ny questions:
1. Am i too young? Should i wait till i am 40 or something because i see all ultra runners are a bit older, will training for an ultra take a tool on my body?
2. I don't like running on asphalt, i got bad shin splints and i was gone for like 3 months 2 years ago so i am scared of running on asphalt but that was probably because i was overtrained, so can you also train for ultra by biking a bit on a stationary bike?
3. How should one without any knowledge how to train approach this if i were to start preparing for my first ultra? Is there a book, some video, should i get a coach?
4. How do you find out about nutrition between ultra's is it trough trial and error, seeing what works best for me?
5. Since i am a student, is this going to cost a lot of money, how many shoes do i need?
6. I think i got a bad running form, when i run my foot goes outside a bit, will these cause some sort of injury in a long run?
That's about it, if anyone made it till here and is kind enough to share their experience i would highly appreciate it.
TLDR: i want to try but don't know where to start, i think i am too young, i am interested in it to find how far i can push my body.",1577296392
ultrarunning,owenfw,“Normal” soreness/pain,"What is “normal” non-injury soreness or pain for you as an ultra runner? What do you feel day-to-day as you’re training? What do you feel in the morning after long training runs? What about as you run?

I’ve been running for about three years, but I still don’t feel like I have a lot of context for what normal soreness feels like for a runner vs injury pain. Like, I know exactly what discomfort to expect a day or two after heavy weight training—sore muscles, sometimes painfully so. But with long distance running, there are completely different kinds of stresses, for example repetitive strain on tendons. In the context of weight lifting and CrossFit, I know what level of everyday pain, fatigue, and so forth to expect as normal parts of a training cycle, as opposed to an acute or chronic injury. But not so much for running. As I’ve run, I’ve had some aches and pains appear and then disappear as I’ve become stronger or backed off and rehabbed a bit. For example, a heel issue I thought might require surgery eventually just went away after careful training. But, on the other hand, some degree of Achilles tightness in the morning after longer runs just seems to be natural for me. 

I assume that other (healthy) runners aren’t just skipping through their lives completely pain free, but what do I know?

My purpose with this question is not to look for a diagnosis or anything I’m experiencing, just to see what others are experiencing and writing off as the price we pay to do what we enjoy.

ultrarunning,wad209,Update: Help for new ultrarunner increasing mileage,"I posted this [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/e3xj8g/help_for_new_ultrarunner_increasing_milage/) question about increasing mileage a week or so ago I wanted to give a follow up. 

I think my biggest problem was actually admitting to myself that I was injured (mildly) and that I needed help. I really want to **thank everyone here who pushed me to got get my running evaluated and see a PT**. In the past I've been able to work through the aches and pains but this issue was not getting better and I was probably headed for stress fracture territory without help. **If there's one takeaway from this, let it be that being injured isn't something to be ashamed of!**

In case anybody was curious about the specifics: I scheduled an appointment at a local PT who had good reviews, especially from triathletes. I scheduled a running evalue. First, the PT did a basic strength and flexibility check. She said that my ankles had very good flexibility and even my hamstrings and quads were pretty good for a runner. Toes could only flex to about 70° although 90° is average (slight bunions probably don't help). Leg, hip, and ankle strength was normal except for hip abductors which were extremely weak (common for runners and cyclists).

Then, she had me run on a treadmill and filmed me running at various different angles. The problem was pretty quickly apparent. Right foot was overpronating and putting stress on the inner ankle, hip was having issues stabilizing, and my core wasn't pulling me forward (I was running almost straight up and down with no lean at all). Cadence of around 172. Then ran with a metronome set about 5% faster (180 spm) and a lot of the issues went away, but I couldn't sustain it for very long.

Got a list of exercises to try and help improve core, abductors, hips and calves and will try some high cadence drills to hopefully fix my running posture issues (which were pretty serious).",1577041183
ultrarunning,macman104,Gap time between multi-day marathon series and 100 mi?,"I just completed the four corners marathon series (4 days, 4 marathons), and am eyeing the NE Challenge (6 days, 6 marathons) this May 2020 with someone I met during this race series as a reunion. For the 4-day, I followed a 100-mi ultra plan from ultraladies. Peaked at 73 mpw (30/20 weekends), going to maintain 45-55 as my base for now.

I really would like to do a 100-mi next year, and I'm wondering if tackling a 100-mi at end of august seems ok to try? I took 1.5 weeks to recover from 4-corners (aqua-running, cycling, etc), so I think I'd have almost a solid two months between recovery from 6-day and before taper for the 100 mi race.

Four corners were trail marathons (7500ft total for the 4 days), and I have plenty of opportunities for trail work if the 100 mi ends up being that. The NE Challenge will be mostly flat and mostly asphalt (2 days of packed dirt).",1577037567

The race is in April of next year and I plan to build up my mileage each week until I hit 100 miles in a week. After running a couple hundred mile weeks, I will taper for 2-3 weeks before the race. 

My question is: how does this plan sound? Does training for pace or distance influence my results for a 100 mile race? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

I can hold an 8:45/ mile pace for at least 30 miles and with proper nutrition and hydration, I think I can finish this ultramarathon.",1576254907

ultrarunning,UcfBioMajor,Thinking about signing up for my first 100 miler,"Like the title says I’m thinking about my first 100 miler and I’m not sure if I’m ready. I’d love to run a race in August, it’s flat, nice trail, 36 hour time limit. The most I’ve ever ran was a marathon. I’m racing my second marathon in March, I’ve done plenty of half’s. Is it illogical to jump right into the deep end? Should I do a couple shorter races first? 50k? 50 miler? Or should I just go for it knowing I may DNF. 
Thanks!",1576242612
ultrarunning,gregRN69,Fat and slow but want to finish this 50K! Please give advice!,"Here is a little bit of context first.  In my early 30s I ran a 50K and finished in 6:18.  I ran a marathon before that and shorter races before that.  Now I am 50.  I put on a bunch of weight (well, put it back on) while I was living overseas for 15 years.  Three years ago I moved back to the states and started Weight Watchers again and I've gone from 382 pounds down to 245.  I've been running for the last three months and just building mileage without any real plan.

So then BLAM, suddenly I see this trail 50K close to where I live that is supposed to be good for beginners.  I ramp up the ""short"" runs to 5.6 miles and I've done some 7, 9, and 14 mile runs.  My long run 3 weeks out (just this past week) was 18.2 miles.  It took me 4:55 to finish.  That's about 16:15 pace.  I made quite a few mistakes.

With the wind chill for my 18.2 mile run it was 19 degrees.  Wind was 13 or 14mph.  I wasn't wearing a balaclava but I had a hooded sweatshirt.  Damn, it's hard to pull the cord tight and tie it to keep the wind out when you are wearing double gloves.  Shit.  I have a balaclava coming in the mail tomorrow.  The parts of my run where I was running into the wind were kind tough.

I thought ""oh, it's cold, I will just fill my 100oz platypus bladder half full.""  Yeah, no.  I ran out of water with like 8 miles to go.  I won't make that mistake again, plus at the race there are aid stations but I will wear my hydration pack and drink when I want.  I'm worried about the hose freezing though- who knows how cold it will be on race day?????

If it's really cold I need better gloves.  Thinking about Anqier ski gloves on Amazon- these seem to get good reviews.  Any other recommendations?

I did a 9.2 mile run Wednesday the 4th of this month and went ""hard"" (for me) and I did the first half in 60 minutes and the last half in 60 minutes.  It was hard to finish at that pace but I got it done.  That's a touch over 13:00 pace.

I've had no overuse injuries of any kind in the training.

My long run (18.2 mile) run was slow but I have been following my weight loss program religiously.  I didn't eat any extra carbs the night before, and only ate two bananas and drank two cups of black coffee before I took off to run.  I think I wouldn't have struggled as much for the last 3 miles if I had eaten some extra carbs the night before and morning of.  I ate my regular portions after the run and went to bed.  At 4AM I woke up and tore into the carbs- crackers, bread, soy milk with sugar- wow, I was so famished.  I weighed the next day and I was up 4 pounds from the week before!!!!  LOL.

I realize my mistakes are what they are, and I'm two weeks from the race so I can't change much right now.  It's got a 9 hour cutoff and I want that buckle very badly.  That's a 17:23 pace.  I plan to work the uphills from the very beginning.  I plan to get some extra carbs the night before and in the morning- just oatmeal and bananas, nothing exotic or weird.  I plan to stay hydrated and stick to my Clif Shots w/100mg caffeine for the race (used four of them for my 4:55 18.2 mile run) and supplement with aid station goodies.  

If anyone has any ideas for me I am open to them!  I have a taper worked out using some marathon plans that I've seen.  I'm iffy on doing a 14.2 mile run exactly two weeks out- maybe 10 miles would be better.  Thoughts?

Even though I did a 50K before, it was so long ago and I was a lot younger so I'm like a noob here.  If you have an idea share it!  Oh, I've been off work for the last few months and will go back shortly after the race but in the months immediately preceding this layoff I was working 12 hour days and often 7 days per week on my feet.  Some days were quite physical- shoveling sand and stuff.  

The last 3 miles of the 18.2 mile run were tough.  I walked when I had to, and ran when I felt I could.  I really wonder how much hydration and managing my night-before and pre-run nutrition might have helped.  For a 14.2 mile run I don't need to walk at all- but I did walk a few minutes on uphills near the end (last 2 miles) in the hopes that I would recover faster.

Thanks for any help- I appreciate it so much!  I promise to report back buckle/no buckle.",1576177958
ultrarunning,whiteshyguy_,Help with long lasting ITB-pain,"Hey all!

I’ve been struggling with a severe it-band injury for the last 2,5-3 years. So far I’ve been through three physiotherapists having three slightly different approaches all with little to no results regarding the injury.

In short the last six months I did a really heavy push with the physiotherapy focusing on strengthening my hip/core and legs in general mixed with a lot of deep tissue massage. We did this to a level where my physiotherapist was sure that I was strong enough. We also did an analysis of my stride, which was also very unproblematic.

So a few days ago I got to try to run on a treadmill under very controlled circumstances. And it took about 7 minutes of very easy running for both my knee and hip to start cramping and hurting. I stop immediately and me and my physio did some strength tests that showed a severe loss of power in my injured side. It’s now been two days of rest and deep tissue massage and my hip and knee are getting better but still hurting a lot compared to the other side. It feels like a crazy muscle soarness - both in the backside of the thigh just above the knee and in the hip around the tfl.

Has anyone had similar problems, do you have any tips for solving this puzzle? I really want to run but these constant struggles are getting to me..",1576141040

ultrarunning,feelsGoodToRun,First ultra training advice,"I am quite keen on jumping on the ultra training as I love mountains and last road running training for a marathon was just too grim! Not enough time on the hills. 

**Background**

26M, 69kg, 5'10"" (177cm). Been running for two years more consistently. I discount trying to break a sub-20 5K on a treadmill every time I ran as training. 

I've been doing some sort of sports for most of my life. Been hillwalking, rock climbing, mountain biking, winter mountaineering, etc. for last 8 years or so. I've also hiked a 96 mile trail in 3 days with camping gear and in leather winter boots - so I did 3 ultras in 3 days, eh (/sarcasm :) ).  

**Training and Past Results**

I had a minor back injury earlier this year, so didn't run for first 2 months of the year. So far, I have done 1380 miles of running this year (only 80mi or so would be on trail) and around 200mi of hiking. I've done Pfitz marathon 18wk/55mi (peak) training cycle this year. The weekly mileage peak was at 62mi, with 42mi and 52mi in between those two. Been top 3%-10% in all road races this year.

3:23 Road Marathon, 41:02 10K.

**Plan**

I finished the reverse taper, my last week was 55 mpw. I am taking this week easy as I have been increasing mileage for 7 weeks straight (8 weeks passed since marathon) and then have some plan again. The plan is to loosely follow Hal Koerner's training plan for a 50 mile race, with possibly increasing peak week beyond what the plan suggests. It's a 16-week plan with mileage staying just above 60 miles. 

I usually spend a week in the mountains in winter with as much climbing as feasible. It will be much less of running week, but possibly much more time on feet and elevation.

Since I haven't done as many trail runs and trail races, here's the outline of the plan with preparation races (incl. elevation):

Week 5: 10K (170m)

Week 10: Half (750m) or Full Marathon (1500m) - can't decide at the time as it's not much of preparation time, but I should be comfortable covering either distance. I'd expect I might need to take full much easier. 

Week 15/16: There's two 50Ks, with either 300m or 900m of elevation.

Week 22: 55 miles with 2250m of elevation. 

I also want to throw in a 33 mi run with 1500m of elevation as it covers a local trail end-to-end and I just fancy doing it. Realistically, that could just be one of my longest runs before or after 50K.

**Question**

I am unsure if 22 weeks will be enough for me to prepare for a 55 mi race. I did struggle on some longer/faster runs on road before where 18 mile run was tough. Saying that, the three 20-milers were pretty good and the last one was super strong. I am going through ""Field Guide to Ultrarunning"" and got ""Relentless Progress Forward"" coming soon.

ultrarunning,Mtn-trailrunner,Review of amazfit bip,"So the bip has been out for awhile, and I was looking at getting one the more flagship model amazfit watches like the Stratos 3 and gtr, which in some ways outcompete the other watches on the market. However, after reading reviews on forums, it seems they release watches too early with lots of software problems and takes about a year to get things stable. 
      So after looking at what do I really want vs need. I thought the bip on paper to be great choice. Not only could I afford it. Which I couldn't afford garmin, suunto, or coros. but it didn't have anything two complicated. GPS plus Glonass, altimiter (pressure sensor) heart rate, and water proof (the latest model). If you get the bip lite, it doesn't have stand alone gps so I don't think it's worth it. Oh and really the other killer part 22 hours of active gps tracking.
      So I've worn it all week, did a test of gps by walking a few km and seeing the result. Seemed to be very accurate and then went out and ran 36km today and 5800 vert. It did very well and although it wasn't at 100% battery when I started my run it had about 50% battery life left after 9 hours of tracking. So I'm assuming had I charged it. it would do 22 hours pretty easy.
      The things that I like the most is how tiny it is. I don't usually wear watches or things on my wrist except for activity but I've been keeping the bip on. It's weighs nothing, and the trans reflective screen is really good. It's also fun that you can change the watch faces.
   The other message and smartish watch feature you have to be connected to your phone, and personally I think smart watches are pretty stupid anyways. I mean you have your f in phone anyways. But whatever.
     The mi fit app isn't so bad, but isn't so great and I do figure out how to do something, but usually after googling it.

I'm (M24) rather new to running as a sport, but have been active most of my youth.  I have never been injured related to sports, other than the time I broke my own leg during soccer.   
I completed my first mountain marathon in september, with approximately 2200 meters elevation, at around 7 hours. The conditions were not the best, raining and temperatures down towards 0 degree Celsius, but I loved it and wanted more. This was with around 3 weeks of preparation. I've also completed a couple of halfmaratons earlier.   
I plan/hope to run an 100k in early august, with over 7000 meters of uphill climbing (and downhill since it is a loop). The course is mostly on trail and it contains seven peaks.

ultrarunning,wad209,Help for new ultrarunner increasing milage,"TL;DR: Looking for recovery, stretching, strength training, etc advice to help maintain injury free running over \~20-25 mile/week.

I've been running for 4 years and have completed two halfs (2017 and 2019) and a marathon (2019). When I was training for halfs, I was able to run \~20 mile weeks without issue and only modest recovery (some stretches and foam rolling). When I started ramping up for my marathon (ran it in late October) I felt like I was always chasing down small issues, trying to stretch specific things only to have another issue spring up. Some issues were serious enough where I felt like I was beginning to infringe on my pain free running rule.

So now that I'm ramping up again for a 50 miler in 2020, I feel like these issues will become even worse. I'm looking for advice on recovery, stretches, exercises, etc to help continue running injury and pain free over \~20-25 miles per week. Specifically, I've had some issues with stiffness above my inner ankle joint that shows up around the 30 minute mark and seems to be made worse by running downhill. But mostly I'm looking for general advice, and can follow up specifics with a PT.

A few details about my specifics:

* I run on both road and trail and primarily do speed work on road and economy running on whatever surface my next race is on.
* I mountain bike and road bike, mostly for fun but I figure it can't hurt, either (within reason, I ramp these down as needed).
* I run in Altra Escalante and Lone Peak (had no problems with zero drop at the \~20 mile/week level).
* I have basic weight lifting knowledge (squats, deadlifts, bent over row etc).",1575125744

ultrarunning,JPNL2018,Races before and after my first ultra,"Hi all. I've been lucky enough to get a spot in the Eiger Ultra Trail 51k (3000m vert) for July 2020. This will be my first ultra so I'm very excited and eager to bite into the training. I'm trying to plan some races throughout the year and would like your input r.e. what is sensible before and after the race, and what is idiotic. 

Background: fitness-wise I have a decent base. I've run 2 road marathons this year, both 3:14, and 2 last year, plus a dozen or so halves over the same period. Typically run 4-5 days per week with a good mix of long, slow, tempo and intervals. I hover around 50-60km per week normally, then push that up to 80-90km per week in the later stages of training. 

I'm concerned about the elevation so would like to do a couple of weekend trips where I can do some heavy hills. I live in the Netherlands so there is nowhere for me to practice on mountainous terrain. A national park with repeats up a single 30-40m hill is all I've got. So, I've spied a trail marathon (Mozart 100) exactly one month before the Eiger race. 42km with 1700m of ascent. **Question is this**: would this be a good training run before Eiger, or is 4 weeks a risky move? Eiger is the goal race, but I feel like I should take any opportunity to get on a trail that I can...

Side note - a buddy is doing another 50km race in Switzerland one month *after* Eiger, that I'd like to join for. It would involve travelling so I'd have to commit to it in advance. Added sweetener is that the second race also has UTMB points. Is 4 weeks recovery enough time for this not to be entirely stupid?",1574858636

I ran my first 50K a month and a half ago and finished 21st out of 300+ runners, and am up to about 80K/week (50mi) training again, doing a couple of strength workouts, and 1-2 speed sessions per week, and a half-marathon+ trail run. I ran 5k in just under 20 minutes the other day (just to see if I could), and recently ran a marathon comfortably in 3h30. Most of my training has been laps around a park, but 1-2 times a week I've had the opportunity to head out to some trails.  


I'm wondering how best to structure my training between now and the race ([Tarawera](https://www.taraweraultra.co.nz/102km-course/), New Zealand), and also wondering what is a sensible goal time ([a recent set of finish times](https://www.sportsplits.com/races/14885/events/3/))?  


For other trail races I've just looked about ten percent of the way down the field, and borrowed someone's even-ish splits as a guide. Does this approach sound sensible again?  


I've read a few books and a million articles, but given that I'm a beginner, I'm feeling rather bamboozled by all the options.

Christmas is coming and i'm looking to ask Santa for a running backpack. I really like the Salomon vest, however, I'm not sure if i should go with the 8 ou 12 litres one. 

This is the mandatory equipment list of the race:   

* Minimum of 1 litre water supply
* Food supply
* Whistle
* Survival blanket, with minimum dimensions of 1,40m x 2m
* Jacket with hood that can support bad weather
* Gloves and hat (tuque)
* Baseball cap or bandana
* Glass or goblet (aid stations do not have glasses)
* Cell phone
* EpiPen   


Would that all fit in the 8 litres one? The smaller the better obviously (and i like the women version of it) but i'm not too familiar with the space all this would take. There is 5 aids stations along the course so i don't think i need more than 1litre of water and food supply isn't THAT much either.

ultrarunning,bigyellowbeacon,Wtf. Running has made my life feel absolutely incredible!,"I was always a casual runner, but in the last year, I decided to step up my running career. 

I did my first marathon a year ago and ran a 4:26.

A month ago, I ran my first 75km in 8:23. I came 7th overall, and I've been over the moon ever since!

I ran my second marathon over the weekend and came in at 3:32! Probably was still suffering from a bit of fatigue and recovery from the ultra, but I still PR'd by almost an hour!

(yes, I will space my big races out better in future, the marathon was more just for the destination than actual time).

But holy crap, I feel incredible everyday now. I feel powerful, and capable, and I know that I can achieve so much in life. I have gained so much confidence through running, it has been the best damn decision I ever made! I am so motivated everyday, and the feeling of pure motivation pulsing through your veins is better than any drug I've ever had.

ultrarunning,cavemanomus,How many season should I tackle before a 100m attempt?,"So I'm going back and forth on signing up for the RRR. I really want to run a 100 miler sooner rather than later, and if all goes according to plan, and I stay healthy, the RRR could be a great race for many reasons:

1) It's 2 months after my last race, which is a 50 miler, so would be able to revere and get a couple more long runs in.

2) It's not far from where I live (North-western Wyoming), so only about 5 hours driving or so, 4 or so if I start from my parents house if they go with me. 

3) It's near my family's ranch in Meeker, so give me an excuse to go down there before and after and see my extended family. 

There are a couple things that would make me not do the RRR, such as:

1) It may be full by the time I have the funds to sign up (Dec 1st).

2) It's in mid September, so would interfere with school a bit.

But  I am wondering how many seasons of ultra racing people had under their belts before deciding a 100m? I think I'd have enough training in the next 10 months to be good on the race, as I have a pretty good race schedule set up for next year, and would be darned near perfect for a fall 100m. Plus if I finished it, it'd allow me to qualify for the Wyoming Range 100 in 2021, which I really, really want to do.

ultrarunning,spooklordpoo,Question about where to structure in certain exercises,"Hi everyone, I had a few questions and am looking for input from those with more knowledge than i!  


As a runner, I am a novice. I've done weight lifting for around 17 years (since 5th grade, im 27 now) but in that time, virtually no serious running.   


Recently, I have adopted running and have done a half marathon (very slow speed) and my longer treadmill days are just over 9 miles (with breaks I use to do some squats, shake legs out, etc)

  
It is important to me to continue having at least: 

1-Lifting 'press' day

2-Lifting 'pull' day  
3-Lifting 'Legs' day (squats, dead lifts, hip thrusts, etc)

4- 'Athletic' day. Sled pushes, tire flips, box jumps, standing high jumps, running can be added in.

But, I am more than willing to work in runs on any of these days as well. As I have been doing so already.

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are,   
\-what days should what runs be on and what day should my 'leg' day be on? 

\-Should I specifically add in some shorter runs to some of the Lifting days? Should I specifically remove some running from some days?  


Currently I am doing (but it does not have to be on a 7 day split, can easily be changed)  


Monday - Push day (chest press, shoulder presses, lat raises)

Tuesday - athletic day / short run (3 miles? but sometimes higher speeds, sprinting mixed in)

Wednesday - Pull day (back workouts, upright rows, rear delt pulls)

Thursday - Random mix day, light presses, accessory work, abs, arms, running (this day is very malleable to me)

Friday - Leg Lift day (squats, dead lifts, etc)

Saturday - longer run higher speed (maybe 7 miles, aiming to work in some 8min mile paces, im not a fast runner)

Sunday - Longest run. (9 miles at 10min pace)

ultrarunning,dannyfisher16257,questions after 50 mile debut,"Hey all.  This past Saturday I completed my first 50 miler at Run the Rock.  I ended up finishing the race, but my final time (10:50) was much worse than I had hoped for (goal of sub 9:30).  While I am proud to have finished what turned out to be a surprisingly difficult course (winning time was 7:50 or so), I suffered a lot in this race.  While my legs were aptly prepared, I had no concept of how much pain my feet would be in the entire time.  Mentally, I wasn't prepared for the race.  When the pain started getting worse and worse through miles 28-40, I let it slow me down.  A lot.  The first 26 mile lap I did in 4:30 exactly, then slowed to a second lap of 6:20.  Physically, I could've gone so much faster.  (I know this because I ran the last 5 miles in less than 45 minutes once I realized how close I was to the finish line.)  While my feet hurt, it wasn't prohibiting me from running faster in any way.  Because of the pain, my brain wanted me to slow down, and I let it win.  My failures in this race came down to a series of mental mistakes.  My optimistic self believes that if I did another 50 in 2020, it would be better- I would know what mental issues I would encounter and be prepared to deal with them and keep running.  However, I am worried that if I did another race the same issues would happen to me again- my mental game would fail and I would not get my desired time again.  And to be clear, my issue wasn't that I didn't go fast enough to achieve some arbitrary time.  My issue was that I did not live up to my own physical potential.  My goal for the next race would be to get whatever time happens when I stop my brain from getting in my own way, and learn to enter and fight through the pain cave, rather than letting it immediately relegate me to a death march pace.  

My questions, for those who have done multiple races of this length or longer-

Did you have a significant mental improvement from your first 50 to your second?

If so, what about your mental game changed from race 1 to race 2?  What did you do or think about differently that contributed to your greater success?

Does the mental response to an ultra simply improve naturally over time, or is it a series of conscious changes to your mental strategy that makes the difference?

Any other general advice is welcome.",1573846349

Pre Race

Over the last two years I have been losing weight and learning how to run. I lost 55 lbs and ran a 5k, 8k, 10k and then a half marathon in 2018. I quickly learned that my true heart was in the mountains and trail running became my focus. Luckily I have a state park with trails and vert very close to my house that I could run throughout the week. In January 2019 I signed up for a 20 miler (Backcountry Rise near Mt. St. Helens). For awhile, I thought that would be my big goal in 2019. But there was this itch in my mind that couldnt shake the idea of an Ultra. So, I signed up for one a week after signing up for the 20. Training was on. 

Over the next 10 months I gradually increased my mileage (from zero due to an injury over the Winter 2018). Worked my base up to around 25 miles a week. I ran Hood To Coast Washington in May (about a half marathon in total distance) which I ran really well. I was feeling great and healthy. 

Unfortunately I had business travel both domestically and internationally which made it hard to keep my mileage up. I kept running where I could but it was mostly treadmills (which I hate). 

My 20 miler in September kicked my ass. Around 4,800 ft of gain over the course! This was my first trail race and first time over a half marathon. I learned a lot about pacing and nutrition (bonked hard due to not eating enough). The course was beautiful and the community of runners was awesome. 

I felt healthy and in-shape before the 50k but I had not been running as much as I would have liked to be at that point. I knew that it was not going to be a pretty performance but I felt I could still do it. 

Race: 

The course immediately drops to the Crooked River and the slams up Misery Ridge (properly named). It then drops down again to the river and then climbs back up to the start for the first Aid Station at mile 5.5. For some reason I just could not get my heart rate in control. My garmin was saying it was like 180-200+ sometimes. This immediately put my mind in a bad place. I knew I could be doing better, my last long run was great, and I had never had heart rate issues on a run before. It sucked. I dropped way back and was already thinking about quitting. 

But, I was running with this older runner and he was so damn encouraging. She had run 55+ ultras in her career. She was happy and encouraging. She told me, ""there is a ton of day left today! You are going to feel a lot better latter, then worse, then better, and so on. Everyone is suffering, it is just how you handle that suffering."" Also she said she was my runner mom and made sure I was eating haha! 

She helped a lot and my mental game turned the corner. My nutrition plan was to eat a gel every hour on the hour and shot blocks every half hour between them. Then eat salty things from the aid station as necessary. The major thing I screwed up in the 20 was nutrition and I didnt want to do that again. From mile 5.5 to 11 I was feeling a lot better. 

The course then has a massive climb up Gray Butte where the majority of the course's 4,700 ft of gain come from. I power hiked it and tried to keep my heart rate under control. This time it felt a lot better and I fell into a groove. Still a bit slower than I wanted but that was okay. I was feeling better. 

By the Aid Station at mile 14, my legs were burning from the climb but mentally and nutritionally, I was feeling good. 

Miles 14 through 20 where where it got real for me. My muscles were aching and I could tell that it was going to be a slog the rest of the way. I found myself counting my paces and alternating between running and hiking. 10 steps of hiking and 30 steps of running. Over and over. This helped me stay in the zone. I belie these miles where around 14 min/miles. Not great, but not terrible if my goal is just to finish. 

There was one cut off 8hrs in at mile 26.5. By about mile 24 I knew I would make it with a half hour to space. That eased my mind. I came into that Aid Station and they told me everyone in the field had made the cut off. Which...meant I was last. lol. If you would have asked before the race if I would be happy with last, I would have said no. But, for some reason, my primary goal of finishing and that runner's comments early in the race stuck with me. ""Someone has to be last!"" I joked. They were super stoked for me which felt nice. 

I knew I had 5 miles are so to finish. It was mostly downhill so I figured it wouldnt be too bad. I was going to finish! So I started running down the trail and the wheels fell off the bus lol. 

My right knee (which I have never had issues with) IT band was screaming. My joint hurt as well. I was confused and in a lot of pain. The impact of running downhill forefoot striking was excruciating. I did my best power hiking and maintained around 18-19 min miles the rest of the way. Not proud of it but...what are you going to do? 

I came across the finish in 9hrs and 14 minutes in dead last place. The race directors and my family where their and they were stoked for me. It felt amazing. I ate a massive burrito and drank two beers. Hobbled over to the car and went home happy. 

Post Race: 

My whole body hurts lol. The only blisters I got were on the inside of my big toes in the same spot on both feet. I had taped them but something was rubbing. Those are painful but going down. Muscles are super sore but nothing I can't handle. My right IT band is jacked up though. I went through this with my left IT band last year so I plan to just take time off, stretch, roll and do clamshells. 

I know this is incredibly slow for most people here but I am proud of finishing. Two years ago I was 225lbs and not running at all. Working full time, backpacking, hiking and traveling made running hard to maintain high volumes throughout the year. But, it all worked out in the end. 

I am ready for more :) I am thinking about doing another 50K in Spring 2020 to hunt for that 8 hr mark. We will see how the knee goes and how much I end up skiing vs running this winter.

I've had capsulitis in my second toe that keeps feeling better and then gets bad as soon as I run again. I have been doing my ortho's advice to work on my calves - though does anyone know how to do that without putting any pressure on your toes? -  but finally realized I have to try custom orthotics. The orthotist said I may also need less flexible shoes and maybe with rocker. That sounds like Hokas, right? I use Altra Escalante on the road (and to just walk around) and both Altra Superior and Topo MT-2s on the trails... all flexible and not rocker-y. I think I should start considering a switch with the Escalantes, so has anyone converted from more minimal to Hokas for the road and have any suggestions (if there are some that aren't a huge lack of ground feel, that are maybe a bit unflexible, etc.)? Oh, and I would like room up front; I know there wouldn't be Altra-level room, but that is ok...  I just think I heard Hoka's can run small (and half-sizing up isn't an option because I'm a size 13).

ultrarunning,nikome21,"Well, I am stuck on the fence in thirst choices","Main questions: which option is better for training long term? And should I be too concerned about not being there with the team on that day?

I have an ultra that I signed up for that’s in about 1 month. However, during the early fall I had a situation where I could not run for a couple of weeks, completely resetting my training. I have been back running now for about 2.5 weeks. If I choose this ultra I will not be ready to run fast, which is fine I do not care about time/position just to run it for the experience.

My other option is to run a 10K with the running club I am a part of that is on the same exact day. If it was not a team event, I would 100% prefer to run the ultra, however a large number of the runners from the club will be there. Part of me does not want to be standoffish. Is this something I should be concerned about, or is this something that I should not overthink one way or the other?

Also, which will have a better effect on my training: running the ultra or not? I plan on taking another longish break late spring/early summer (about 6 months from now). If I run the ultra, it is likely my coach will want me to take a few days off. Training will reset just a little, not all the way. I will then have about 4.5 months of training/racing (5-10K distance). However, if I run the 10K I will be able to train straight through until late spring/early summer. I will have much more time to build a base, and have more time to race.

* Joe Rogan's content curation company flagged the video automatically 
* I disputed the flagging as 'fair use' based on editorial commentary

**Training**
I used the Ultra Ladies, https://www.ultraladies.com/free-training-plans.html, training plan. I did not miss a run, until my taper. Then, thanks to some comments here, I was not worried as”the hay was in the barn” to quote excellent comments. 


I'm training for the Keys 100 in May, so this was a “training run”. I tested food, hydration, gear, etc. on my long back to backs, marathons and I thought a 50 would be a great idea. I was going to take a week off after the 50, then ramp up 2 weeks to start my Keys100 training. I did 5 trail runs, up to 20 miles, with 1 after dark to test my night running. My training was primarily on the road. 


**Course and Prep**
It was a 50 mile out and back through the Seneca Greenway and Muddy Branch trail system in Montgomery County. It was undulating mainly single track. Roots under slippery leaves keep me on my toes. Some slight streams, but it's been generally dry. 


It was predicted to be the coldest day of this winter, 22F, so I dressed accordingly. UA Coldgear base, Smartwool then a zippered general UA top. Salomon wind resistant tight, Buff, Drymax socks and Inov-8 x-talon shoes. Petzl Swift RL headlamp, my old Black Diamond finally died. Salomon Adv-5 vest. All the gear was great, I took the buff off and used the zipper to regulate my temp. If I have any criticism its with the Salomon soft flasks, they have to have a bigger opening. Tailwind and Huma gels are my goto, with additional aid station food.


**Race Day**
Up at 3:30am, eat ½ English muffin with nut butter and banana. Cold brew coffee and ready to go. 1 hour drive and I do packet pickup, hang around, use the facilities. Which btw, you never realize how fast you can “go” when there is 1 stall and a long line :)


6AM, start out nice and slow, headlamp on. About a mile on the road and then a left into the woods. Parts are feeling decent, not too cold, trying to find my pace. Things are pretty much on track for the 1st 15 miles. I have my watch remind me every 15 minutes to drink or do a gel. After the 1st hour I try and do 200 calories or so an hour. I let my body decide if I want something at the aid stations. Again training through all these factors made me pretty confidant that I had a good plan.


Around 15 I get a bit of a twinge on the outside top of my left knee. Humm, I've never had that particular pain before. During my 2nd run when I started my taper I had an issue with the inside top of that same knee. During a 4 miler it started giving me sharp pains. I chalked it up to the taper paranoia, but I did ice it and take a run off to give it rest. During my taper it would be a bit sore for the 1st 10 minutes then all was fine, I never thought about it again.


I'm noticing that it's starting to take on more of my focus, it's starting to hurt, a lot. I generally reach a point where all those aches and pains become my focus, then I relax and tell myself “Of course this is going to hurt, accept it and stop dwelling on a pain or 2”. This was different. 


I get to 24 miles and I'm limping at this point. The cutoff was 6:30 hours for 24, I was 52 minutes under when I checked the prior aid station, I was only 40 minutes under when I got to the checkin. I would walk, then start running, slow or fast it did not matter, the pain would ramp up to an 8 out of 10 within 2 minutes. With any rut or descent it would make me yelp in pain. 


I figure OK, lets get to the next aid station, so off I go. I'm now running maybe a minute, then I have to walk. Mind you everything else is spot on. I'm still peeing, feel fine, except for this damn knee. I get to 27, now I'm 28 minutes off cutoff, which is at the next aid station at 34. I gather myself and figure this is it, lets get to that aid station no matter what. Off I go. I'm alone for 7 miles. My knee is killing me, but if I can keep moving I will make it. Then on descents I almost fall, my knee seems like its not able to hold me up as it should. It happens again and again. I suppose that's when I realized I'm not going to make 50 miles. I get to 34 with 5 minutes to spare. They are breaking down the aid station. I limp over to the timer and spit out “I think I'm going to have to bail”. 


I've been running for 40+ years and this is the 1st time I did not finish a race. But, it's the 1st time I had an injury bad enough it made me stop. 


**Post-race info**
I'm leaning towards ITBS, something that I've never experienced before. I know I'm not a Dr., I did make an appointment already with an orthopedic Dr. to make sure its nothing more serious. I'm doing the whole RICE thing, stretching, etc. My 100 training starts on 11/25 with 3 weeks of base, so my goal is to be 100% ready for that.


What went right; 
	Hydration, gear, food.


 What went wrong; 
	Well, my knee. I stuck to the training plan. Though I did some trail runs, I wonder if I should have done more? While I did hills in training, I wonder if the constant up/down did me in or was it the pain I had when I started my taper? If I had to do it again, I would probably do ½ my runs on trails or find a road 50.

ultrarunning,barbellbash,Ultrarunning while increasing 1RMs [xpost from r/weightroom],"For most of my time actively pursuing fitness I have focused on lifting, and while not a competing or aspiring to competing powerlifter, my goals have always been to increase my maxes. Fast Forward to about a year ago, and I got into distance running. Three marathons under my belt to this point, and next month doing a 50K. My goal, for running, is to run a 100 mile race in under 24 hrs. There are a lot of training plans and articles online, but none of those incorporate any type of serious lifting regime. My training plan to date has been generally a two week cycle like this:

Monday - Heavy Upper Body Compound Lift (5-3-1-3+-3+ at 75%/85%/95%/85%/85% 1RM), then accessory work (Week 1 push lift, week 2 pull lift)

Tuesday - Recovery run 4-6 miles

Wednesday - Lower Body Compound Lift (5-3-1-3+-3+ at 75%/85%/95%/85%/85% 1RM), then accessory work (Week 1 squat lift, week 2 deadlift variation)

Thursday - 7-10 mile tempo run

Friday - HIIT/Sprint Workout AM, Upper body hypertophy based workout (Week 1 pull, week 2 push)

Saturday - Lower body hypertrophy based workout (Week 1 squat, weak 2 deadlift/variation)

Sunday - Long trail run (14-20 miles generally, peak at 24 miles before 50K race)

The real goal for me is in 2020 I want to lift a 1200 lbs total and complete a 100 mile race in less than 24 hrs, and I want to do those two things within a week of each other.

Questions for anyone who has done similar distances while maintaining strength:

\-How much does strength/running get in the way of each other as the weekly mileage increases? I know for the 100, ill need to up it to long runs back to back days on saturday/sunday

\-The race im looking at is September, so I'd be training for 10 months. Is this enough time, or should I set a benchmark goal for this year? I.e. a 100K instead

ultrarunning,Thelibertyexpeirment,Ultrarunning has just given me the most important lesson so far - humility.,"Hi all, 

After injuring my ankle and still not being able to run more than 2km after 3 weeks of rest, I have finally ignored my ego and cancelled my flights and hotel for my next ultra. 

Not really something I would have thought to post, but after thinking about it, I realised everyone always wants to share the victories and plans so why not the hiccups too?

&amp;#x200B;

I planned to race the Costa Blanca 85km, and have spent the entire of summer being super committed and motivated for running. I went beyond all my volume goals and was super excited for the race - it was on my birthday weekend and was a good excuse to get a mini-holiday in Spain... 

I did a 50km training run and then planned to go into 2/3 week taper. Well, the 50km was probably one of the best runs in my life, I went through the lows, and found myself reaching a ""runners high"" I have not experienced before for 35km until the finish.... well 5 minutes before the finish anyway. I really surprised myself with how good I felt finishing and it gave me so much confidence for the race. In the final 5 mins something twitched in my ankle and I didn't think too much of it, I mean I had just ran for 8/9 hours in the mountains I was expecting *something* to feel shit. 

I wake up the next day and can barely walk on it. Fast forward to 2 weeks after and I can still barely get anything more than 10 mins running before it felt uncomfortable again. Throughout this whole time, I maintained that I would be good for the race. Failure wasn't an option of course, I sold myself an attitude of never quitting no matter what (too many goggins videos?), I am an ultrarunner after all and we're defined by being ""super-human""... right?

With a week to go to the race I tried to do another little jog and see if any miracles happened overnight, unfortunately they hadn't. I genuinely felt like shit mentally - I had trained so hard for something, and now I can't do it? What reason would I give people, surely I will be embarrassed and have to make an excuse? How can I call myself an ultrarunner if I QUIT? What's the point in running? 

I had lost all motivation that had been keeping me pushing and committed for months, which made me question the point of it all. I forced myself to sit down with a notepad and go through the pro's and con's of running this race. I avoided this since the beginning because it was pretty obvious there wasn't any good reason to try go through with it. The rational reasons quickly became in abundance, and the more I wrote the more I realised they were buried beneath the denial all along - **Obviously** just one race doesn't define my entire passion for running, it obviously doesn't mean that the months of hard work and discipline are now worthless. I am not ""quitting"", I am not letting anyone down, I am not abounding my interest in running or the mountains. 

Whilst all this may seem like pretty obvious crap, I have surprised myself with how quickly emotion clouded my thoughts, and I felt it would be worth sharing as I am sure many have gone through similar situations. Now I feel like I can actually go back to watching Billy Yang without feeling guilty, and that yeah a big part of being interested in ultras is the obsession, drive, and commitment to push yourself, but more importantly, it's about respecting and listening to your body and understanding why you're doing it to begin with. 

At first, I thought this injury was going to kill all motivation for running, but now I see it as an opportunity to appreciate all the positive reasons that got me into the sport to begin with. After all, if races didn't exist would I still be running? Damn right I would... 

The physical growth and progress we see is the most obvious from training for ultras, but this whole injury experience has taught me to appreciate the lessons and development it provides us for life in general, even when the Hoka's are collecting a bit of dust.

Last weekend I ran my first 100k at Javelina Jundred and had a blast.  It was both incredibly challenging but also very fun and since it wasn't full of giant mountains I was able to run the majority of the distance and finish in the top 10 in my age group.  It was a huge accomplishment for me.

I know Chamonix is incredibly beautiful. I've been to Switzerland the past three years to run the Eiger Ultra (35k once, 51k twice).  I get crushed there, like bottom half of finishers.  Yes, the scenery is amazing but almost every other aspect of the races there are cold and sterile.  The aid stations are horrible, volunteers are robotic, other racers are pumped up a-holes cloaked in spandex and compression everything.  There is no community like at Ultras in the US.

Then on top of that it is a logistical pain in the ass.  Europe is generally expensive, it takes a long time to get there and get home and I don't have easy access to mountains/high elevation to train in.

For the cost of going to UTMB from NYC I could probably make three trips to run in Arizona, have more fun, run more of the race and finish a lot stronger.",1572478294

But with all of that I haven’t been able to train for about 4 weeks now, and this is after a planned 4 week break from training while on a road trip.  

I found out a couple weeks ago that I have the Epstein Barr virus, aka Mono.  My doctor told me it’s an old infection that was reactivated, I suspect that I originally got this infection about 12 weeks ago.  I was so fucked up, more precisely my immune system was so weak, I had a gnarly case of sinusitis on top of my Mono.  I finished my antibiotics for the sinusitis about 5 days ago but do still have some post nasal drip and kinda think I still have some fatigue and weakness from the mono.   But I also could just feel weak and fatigued because I haven’t worked out in 8 weeks which has disrupted my sleep.  I’ve been sick for so long I don’t even remember what feeing normal is like.  

I’m starting to go a little crazy from the lack of physical activity but I am still experiencing some symptoms.  I don’t want to reactivate the infection again from getting back into training too soon but I NEED to start training again ASAP.  

How do I know when I can start training again?

Should I just count on waiting this out a month or two more?  Maybe I’d be better off in the long run from 3-4 months off from training compared to throwing some sub-par training into the mix alongside getting sick again.

At the cutoff pace for the marathon had no problem from heart or lungs or muscles (just tightness after about 20 miles) No blisters or injuries at all from marathon was just pretty sore for two days. Used to run cross country and believe my form is overall pretty good but will have a running coach double check in the next week just to be sure.  


For long runs is it more important to always stay on your feet or is it fine to split up the run some throughout the day or rest some? Not sure if that is a trade off between trying to keep my legs healthy (stretching making sure things don't get tight) vs doing continous non-stop runs. Is it more advised to go slowly simulating race pace and mostly focus on the miles (the pace for a 30 hour finish is like 3.3 mph which is not fast a struggle, i'm aware it's going to be insanely mentally tough to keep that pace up for so long however). Any other advice to maximize recovery/injury prevention or any other pitfalls to look out for?",1572472429

ultrarunning,mattrmueller,Training to run slower or training to run/walk for very long events?,"I am about to begin a long block of training that will hopefully culminate in a last runner standing event next April. I have done several 12 hour timed races in the past, but that is the longest amount of time I've ever spent in a running event. I am hoping to spend significantly more time out there in April.

In general volume is the primary goal during most of this training block. I have usually capped out at about 6-7 hours of running time per week (40-50 miles on a mix of road and trail) in the past when training for ultras, and am looking to increase that safely by the end of this block.

Currently any training runs that get slower than about 9:15/mile on flat, non-technical terrain (especially pavement) feel really uncomfortable on my legs/joints. I suspect that perhaps my muscles get ""lazy"" at this pace, and despite efforts to try and focus on various cues I haven't yet found a way to get comfortable at slower speeds.

I am trying to figure out what would be most beneficial to work on during this training:

&amp;#x200B;

* Training to run slower than I am currently comfortable running, especially on long runs.
* Training to keep my current paces stable where they are, but adding structured walk intervals to my long runs.
* Both.

Any insight or tips, especially from those that have had good luck at events &gt; 24 hours?",1572358712
ultrarunning,staringspace,Ultrarunning tips and tricks for long run anxiety,"Hi all,

My background: Been running road for 5 years (half marathons, etc.), until I moved back home to the countryside. Ever since, I've been slowly building up my distances on trail and about 3 weeks ago I took part in my first trail race over half marathon distance (17 miles). It was hard (hilly and boggy, took longer than I wanted!) but I'm incredibly glad I did it, and it's opened me up to a lot of ideas regarding some ultras/multi-day adventures. I really want to do some crazy adventures like running Hadrian's Wall/running the length of some national parks in the UK.

However, the one thing that's always held me back is the anxiety I get on long runs. No matter how much I prepare the night before, my GI system hates me the morning of a long run. As soon as I start, I normally feel okay, but then towards the end (normally when running distances that are unknown territory), my brain takes over and I keep worrying about if I'll faint/throw up/pass out and no one will find me. During the trail race, I started feeling pretty sick in the last 10km and even though I pulled through it without any consequences, the anxiety of keeling over in the middle of nowhere definitely slowed me down and made me lose time.

For those who are seasoned at longer distances - what tricks do you use to try and keep your brain in the best shape possible on long runs (training or races)? How often do you rely on others to pull you out of any slumps you get?

***TL;DR: Get anxious on long runs. What advice do you have for getting through those thoughts that you're going to pass out and die with no one to find you?***",1572358003

### Splits
| Mile | Time |
There are a lot of miles here. I'm gonna direct you to Strava (ps. feel free to follow me if interested, I just started using Strava relatively recently).

### Training
Brief background: I ran my first ultra, a 50 miler, in 2013 and was horribly undertrained, finishing in 11 hours. After that, I didn't really have the ultra bug for a while, even though I still ran consistently (~30-40 miles a week) throughout the years. In 2017, I did a 12 hour race, largely on a whim (decided two days beforehand because I thought it looked fun, and figured that the time aspect meant that I could just stop running whenever), and ended up finishing in fourth place with ~58 miles. I then moved to another area of the country for medical school, and maintained my fitness w/ the aforementioned 30-40 miles a week, but put any serious attempts at another ultra on hold until I adjusted to my new schedule.

Fast forward ~2 years and even though I was on clinical rotations (arguably the hardest year of medical school), the ultra bug bit again, and I signed up for a 6 hour race about a month out, though I didn't alter my normal training that much. I ran and won that race with ~39 miles in terrible conditions, and that fueled the fire for a longer ultra, so after perseverating for a couple of months, I signed up for the Cape Fear 24 hour race, one of the few 24 hour races where I could sleep in my own bed the night before.

My training for this race was a similar pattern to prior races - more or less anywhere from 30-45 miles a week, spread over 5-6 days a week. Most of my miles are done at a pace that is much quicker than ultra pace, typically anywhere from 7:00-7:30/mile, a pace which is comfortable for me. This time, however I tried to be more cognizant about incorporating longer runs than I had in the past (I think my longest was 18-20 miles), and also spent a lot of time on my feet/standing during the day and doing some long/hilly day hikes whenever I could. I also experimented with nutrition on runs, something I had never really done in the past, and settled on Tailwind. Unfortunately, in the months leading up to the race, I was studying for my most important board exam, which severely limited my free/running time, even more than normal.

### Pre-race
Race started at 8a and was about an hour drive away, so I woke up at 5:45 and drank some coffee/putzed around a bit before driving out there. The course was a 0.59 mi (more or less 1k for you non-Yanks) loop around a local park, and the nice thing was that you could park your car and then set up personal aid right next to the path. I set up my aid (extra clothes, a chair, some tailwind, etc.) and then talked to other runners. One other runner recognized me from the 6 hour race I did, which was pretty neat. The ultra community is so tight-knit and welcoming, and it was nice to just chat with people. It blew my mind how many people had also run in the Hinson Lake 24/Yeti 100 just a few weeks earlier.

Didn't think a warm-up would be necessary for a 24 hour race.

### Race
The race started, and we were off at a ~~blistering~~ reasonable ultra pace. I just kind of settled into a rhythm and told myself that this was an (ultra)marathon, not a sprint. I chatted with my fellow runners and just kind of took in the sights. Talked with a guy who had run the aforementioned Yeti 100. He was telling me that he was still pretty sore, which made perfect sense to me.

Interestingly enough, when I think back to the race itself, there are large swaths of time that just seem to disappear. The brain is pretty fascinating. I continued at what felt like a comfortable pace, stopping to stretch or walk occasionally. My biggest concern during the first part of the race was hydration - the temp crawled into the 80s, and even though I was stopping and drinking water almost every lap, at one point I peed and it was a very very dark yellow. All of my friends in medical school are always joking about me getting rhabdo, and I decided that today would not be the day I get rhabdo, so I stopped and just pounded a ton of water and Tailwind, which seemed to work out, because then my pee was a more reasonable color after that.

Even though I haven't done many ultras, I try to learn something with each ultra that I do, and so I felt like any 'trouble' issues that I had had in the past were largely ironed out. Stomach issues are alleviated with Imodium. Chafing is eliminated with SportShield and using wet wipes after the bathroom. Blisters are (largely) eliminated w/ injinji sock liner + wrightsock (thanks, fellrnr!).

At some point, I realized that I had the lead and was just focused upon maintaining a steady rhythm for as long as I could. My two goals were to run longer than I ever had before, and the stretch goal was to hit 100 miles. I hit 50 miles in 8:20 (a substantial PR over my one other horrible 50) had a sizable lead, and was feeling pretty good. When I hit the lap to get me over 58.5 miles (my prior distance PR), I realized that it was all uncharted territory and that I could be proud with whatever the result was.

At 12 hours, I hit around 68 miles, and could definitely feel the fatigue in my legs beginning to build up. I kept eating junk food at the aid stations, playing mental games with myself, not looking at the giant screen they had displaying results, and trying to count down laps until I would hit an arbitrary distance, at which point I would repeat the process. I think in these later stages, my relative lack of any really high mileage weeks began to take its toll, and I began to slow down some and take more frequent walk breaks, but still had the lead by 6-7 laps at this point.

When I realized it was inevitable that I would actually get 100 miles and the belt buckle, this provided a huge mental boost. I actually ran my fastest lap on the lap to get to the 100 mile mark, hitting the distance in 18:41. However, once I hit 100 miles, I felt like all of the wind had been knocked out of my sails, and I kind of just lost the drive to keep going because I had met my goal and would be getting that sweet sweet belt buckle. It also probably didn't help that it was around 3 in the morning and I was exhausted. It really is just a huge mental game.

For most of the night hours, I had been telling myself that I could take a walk break once I hit 100 miles, so I did just that. I walked for two laps, and then found that it was almost impossible for me to motivate myself to run again. My body just wasn't having it. I think what happened is that during the time that I walked, my body cooled down and decided that it had had enough. So, I decided to take a nap. I drive a civic, and I curled up in the back seat and fell asleep for two hours. This is very notable because I normally have extremely difficult time sleeping anywhere that isn't my own bed, let alone the back of a compact car, so a sign of how exhausted I was. After I woke up, I realized I had been passed by two people, but again had the belt buckle as my solace, so I walked for a few more miles for a total of 106.524 miles and third place overall (second male).

### Post-race
Waddled around and got that belt buckle at the award ceremony, drove home, showered, passed out for a few hours, then ate an entire large pizza while my roommates made fun of me (for both the waddling and the pizza). Had a few blisters on my toes (guess I need to get bigger shoes to account for swelling), but nothing major. Was sore for a few days after, especially with squatting, and also noticed that my left hip abductor was very very sore, something I have never dealt with before. I tried to run at about 5 days after the race, and didn't try anything more than a half mile because it just felt too uncomfortable with my groin. However, after a few more days and with some yoga sessions, this thankfully went away and I'm back to running again, and hit 30 miles last week. My legs definitely still feel a bit fatigued, but I'm expecting that to slowly improve w/ time. 

All things considered, I'm very happy with the race and that I met my goals, even though I think 24 hour pacing purists would probably argue that I crashed and burned during my race. I definitely want to race another 24 hour in the future, and learned so much during this one that I'm confident I could run an even better, smarter, race.

Right now, I'm at a bit of a crossroads with what I want to do with my training - I can't figure out if I want to shift towards marathon training and get a BQ (for various school reasons, this would be the year to do it), or if I want to train for another 24 hour race or another ultra. I'm run commuting this year and can get ~40 miles a week on that alone, so I think whatever I do, I'll have a stronger base to build on!

ultrarunning,n1lul,Will I make the cut-off?,"Just ran my first Ultra (Patapsco Valley 50k) this weekend in preparation for the JFK50 next month. My overall pace for the 50k was 17 min/mile.  The overall cut off pace for JFK is 15:30 min/mile.  Looking at his in writing I would say no, I will not make the cut off.

The 50k was pretty hilly and technical with twice the elevation of JFK

The cutoff coming off of the AT section of JFK at mile 15.5 is 19 min/mile. After that it is flat for 26 or so miles and then finishes on road rolling hills.

My flat marathon pace was 10:45 min/mile.

I do not want to be pulled.

So what do you all think?  Should I go for it or pull the plug, save the money/time it will take to go up there for the weekend and keep training to get so I am not chasing the cut offs.

### Training

I talked a bit about this my report on running the [Table Rock 50k](https://old.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/d7qfaw/race_report_table_rock_50k_who_needs_switchbacks/), but essentially the birth of my son in April I had to adjust my schedule to accomdate baby duty (haha I said duty) and had plenty of 4am wake ups to run at [4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kGiufxr89c). I averaged about 55 mpw with the most at 59 miles and my longest run at 16 miles. I took a bit of a modified Hanson Method approach.

### Course and Prep
It was three 17+ mile loops on single track trails with plenty of rolling hills, roots and somewhat rocky for mountain bikes.  After finishing each loop you had access to your drop bags where I had tailwind, nutrition, extra shoes and socks, and roller. 


### Race Day

**Loop 1:**  It was dark.  It was a 5am start time and I spent much of that time with a headlamp and in conga line on single track.  There was the normal groups those that took off at the start, the middle pack, and the ones in the rear.  I took what I thought was a slow and easy approach and stuck with the middle of the pack and ended up finishing the first loop at 3:38:58 @ 12:53 pace.  Loop 1 was pretty uneventful.

**Loop 2:** At the start of loop 2 I refilled my water, grabbed some food, and I hit my drop bag to restock on nutrition.  Overall, a fairly decent transition I felt as I had things laid out in my bag in certains spots for easy access. Around mile 23 I started to feel a bit down and realized I hadn't been taking in enough calories and starting to take in some more.  

Around mile 26 or so I was in a bad head space and considered dropping for no other reason than it was fucking hard.  I almost did it and then I realized that me quitting was not going to be part of my identity, at least for present and future me.  I knew that my wife was going to be at the end of this race for me, I wasn't going to set an example to my son of being a quitter because something got hard, and I knew that I just needed to make it to loop 3 to pick up my pacer.

I got to the next aid station and loaded up on food and took a few extra minutes there to regroup.  I recall hearing many racers have used potatoes to help fuel up and there were plenty of boiled potatoes at the aid station.  I hate russet potatoes with a passion ever since a kid, my parents were gear up for battle like Mel Gibson in Braveheart to eat these things.  I forced myself to eat one, then two, and then before I knew it I had eaten the equivalent one russet potato.  If my parents could see me know.  Every aid station I was eating potatoes. 

I took off from the aid station with 8 miles to go before finishing loop 2.  I started to remember the basics and force myself to eat every 3-4 miles, walk the hills, and run\walk pattern.  With three miles left of loop 2 I put on some music and came in strong.

**Loop 3:** I got to the finish where my pacer was waiting for me.  He grabbed my spare shirt and restocked my nutrition for me while I ate potatoes and other typical ultra food.  I tried to rinse off in the bathroom to cool down a bit and clean up, but the water was hot so that didn't accomplish what I wanted.  Before taking off I rolled out my legs and reapplied some lubricate, chaffed nips are no good.  It was around this loop my knee started to flair up a bit. In between slow running I mall walked the shit out of that course.  Arm swinging, small steps, and hips thrusting.  

Overall I was in a great mental space, my pacer and I chatted about the course and my head space from earlier, and miles were ticking by.  He pushed me to run when I should and told me to hike when I should.  It was great to have that motivation and guidance.  

I hit the back half of the course, mile 8ish, and my knee flared up more and needed to power hiked more than I want to admit.  My pacer kept on with talking me through the course and pushing me to run and hike.  I hit mile 6 and knew that I had just a training run left and need to try and push more.  Before I knew it I was passing someone, and then another one.  Then there was orange socks guy and boston guy (redsoxs hat) that we kept playing leap frog with.  I told my pacer that I wanted to put distance between them and he pushed me.  Finally around mile 3 my pacer said, **you're at a point where we can coast in or leave it all on the course**.  I threw in music and we hammered down.  Before I knew it I was running through the knee pain, I was passing boston guy.  We hit mile 15.5 and I saw the orange socks in through the trees and hammered down to pass him.  We hit the final stretch of the race and at mile 50 I had my fastest pace of 10:26.

Everyone was so supportive and I am now feeling very ready to tackle Tunnel Hill in 2 weeks, which will be my first 50 mile distance. Now I could use some pacing help. 

So my first ultra was this summer. In the middle of hot July I ran 29.7 miles in a 6 hour timed race. That came to a 12:06 pace. I had quite a few walk breaks to cool down because I don’t do well in the heat and was really overheating. 

One week ago I did my second ultra, another six hour race. This time the temp was in the 40-50s and I got 35 miles with effectively no walking at all. My pace started solidly at 9:48/mile through the first 21 miles. I faded into 11m/m or so for the remainder to finish at 10:18/mile overall. I was running again 2 days later with no ill effects other than a little bit of lasting fatigue that is now completely cleared. 

Tunnel Hill will be as cool or more so, I just don’t know exactly how much I should slow down further, or if I should build in forced walk breaks.

I get 5 mins in before making the decision to call it off as it definitely didn't just feel ""sore"" and was a feeling I hadn't experienced before. I have now not ran since Sunday but still have an uncomfortable feeling, and it seems to come and go but at times can definitely still resemble a ""pain"" even when just sitting/walking. I am starting to panic a bit because this is my first injury, and being so close to the race and not being able to run is starting to test my sanity. My ankle pain aside - I am super excited and confident for the race.

I will try look for a PT but with only a couple weeks until race day I am trying to rationalise the best strategy... Do I try run on it to confirm if it is indeed a ""proper injury"" and then rest as much as poss til race day, do I literally just rest now until it feels somewhat better? I understand the ""hay is in the barn"", and was realistically going to do a 2 week taper anyway... so do I just make this longer? This is where I need your guys help please!

I haven't really done any cross training so far because I love running and haven't had any issues when ramping up volume, so whilst I admit the best strategy would be to cross-train whilst I rest it.... On the other hand, because I am so close to the race is it even worth adding strength/swimming at this point when I have never touched before?

Whilst these may sound like stupid/basic questions - this is not a situation I've had to deal with before, and because it's so close to a race I am excited for, I am worried that I am making it seem worse than it is... I am just not too sure what the best strategy actually is.

Thanks for the advice as always",1571921978

to make a long story short, after my last race (the 50k, October of last year) I stopped running. depression hit, things at home got rocky, I was homeless for two months and eventually the whole thing culminated in a suicide attempt in June of this year. 

now, i want to get back to running but i've since started working as a CNA and I do 70+ hours a week at work in order to support myself, dog and sometimes younger siblings. I know that's not an excuse, im just wondering how y'all with exhausting jobs and busy schedules make it work. I can't cut back to less than 60 hours. but I want this so bad. it's a PRIORITY.

ultrarunning,Teroc,"[Training Question]Elevation training in Flatshire, UK for 24h race?","**Background:** 

I was looking at races for next year when I came across one that sounds quite fun and stupid hard: [The Snowdon 24.](https://alwaysaimhighevents.com/snowdon-24/snowdon-24-home)

Basically, you run up and down Llanberis Path to summit Snowdon as many times as you can in 24 hours. 15km loop with ~1km vert each time. Since I have never done anything close in term of vertical climb (most I've done is maybe 1.2km over 27km in the Malvern Hills), I went to Wales this weekend to try out the course...

Well, I'm definitely not ready to do this for 24 hours! I ended up climbing it twice in 4 hours and boy was I dead at the end. I originally wanted to do it 3 times, but I guess I went too hard and my legs said no. I walked most of the way up, jogging when the gradient wasn't too crazy. The way down is were the damage happened. I went down quite slowly (~6.5min/km) as it was quite busy, it was raining a lot and I went with my normal running shoes (I know...), but it's quite technical and there is a lot of impact. My quads took quite a pounding, and they're pretty sore today.

**Question:** 

I live in the Midlands, where the highest hill in the area is literally 250m high. I have to drive 45min minimum to find a long enough hill where you can climb for at least 10-15min. Most of my hill repeats are done on a very short hill but very steep and it's very close to home. 

Question is then: how would you go about training for an event like that? My mountain legs are pretty inexistent. On the few ultras I did this year, my HR would shoot up to 170 if I didn't walk uphill. Climbing Snowdon, even powerhiking it, my HR was in the 165-170 zone the whole time (185 max HR).

On the flat I'm usually ok. PRs for indication: 5k 19:20, 10k: 39:40, HM: 1:28:00, 52k (500m up): 4:24:00, 100k (1700m up): 12h.

My goal is to do at least 7 climbs in 24 hours. 10 would be great, but that's 2h30 average including the stops... I don't think I can do that. Or maybe it's too early for me to do an event like this and I should wait another year?

I’m looking at doing a 50 mile ultra in 2021 in CO when I turn 30. I may run a shorter ultra this coming year as well. 

I am looking around for a quality running watch. I used to run with a Garmin and liked it, however they are not rated very well in terms of battery life. People frequently review them complaining their battery life in GPS mode is sub 4-5 hours. This is a problem to me with ultra running. 

Coros watches are rated very well and have the best battery life. They also, come with a hefty price tag. I really like the Coros Vertix with a retail of $599

How important is it to have a good quality GPS watch with great battery life? 

My brother whos going to run it with me just wants to use his phone GPS the whole time... but thats almost certainly going to suck down battery life right? Not good if you get to the end and need to call someone in an emergency. 

I feel like its a big safety issue. You never know what can happen on a trail in terms of weather, injury, sickness, or not finishing before dark etc. 
I personally feel like having a quality watch with battery life is pretty important. But I want to make sure I’m not just trying to justify blowing money on a fanch watch. So I want some opinions from those of you with experience. Be my accountability partners lol

\### Training

At the age of 32, having been inert for most of my adult life, I started running. That was two and a half years ago. I adored my first half marathon. I was faint for the last four Ks, straining to finish in under 100 minutes. I immediately signed up for a marathon in two months' time. I limped through sharp pains for the last 25K of my marathon because I had donations riding on the race. Since then I've typically run up to 4 times a week, occasionally building to a casual half marathon race, enjoying the improvements to one's life that running brings.

&amp;#x200B;

In January a friend mentioned that he was running a trail ultra in October. That seed grew in my mind, and in March I said I'd join him. By June I'd built enough fitness to run a half marathon+ each weekend, and was devouring books, podcasts, articles and so on, working out how best to prepare. This time I was mindful of not doing too much too quickly, so it was mostly an exercise in restraint. Being in nature is by far my favourite thing about this new obsession! I zoom out in Google Maps, pick off green areas and go explore. I can't think of anything I'd rather do with my weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

My training peaked with some 85k weeks, a 3h30 marathon and a whole bunch of trail runs to match my race's conditions. I finished in something like the 85th percentile for all my training races, so I looked at last year's results and worked out that a good aggressive goal would be 5 hours (top 20 or 30 out of 350 or so runners).

&amp;#x200B;

I felt truly prepared, and knowing how competitive I am, thought it would be wiser to run the 74K option slowly than to run hard in the 50K as a newbie. Unfortunately the 74K was full, and the 100K seemed a bit much given my beginner-ness, so I had to try and be sensible about the 50K.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Taupo is stunning - it's a lake so large you feel you are facing the ocean. The air is perfectly clear, and there are no nasty animals trying to kill you (I'm Australian). Knowing full well that the worst thing you can do is go out too hard, I ran all but three of the first twenty-five kilometres ahead of my planned pace. But this wasn't entirely stupid, because I knew there was a big hill coming, and it seemed sensible to bank some medium effort fast kilometers, and be sensible on the hill.

&amp;#x200B;

My intentions of running the hill soon faded when I realised I might have nothing left if I did that. I was slow, and after the hill, about 30K in, I could not believe the splits I was seeing - surely my watch was broken, showing me 7min/K downhill, given the massive effort I was putting in. Had I butchered myself by going out too hard, or am I simply not strong enough yet? 

&amp;#x200B;

From 35k it was a challenge to run fast, so I enjoyed applying mental tricks I've picked up on this forum and by listening to interviews with boss runners. My sub-5 goal was slipping away, which was an extra challenge, but after an hour or so, I realised that my watch actually was lying to me, because I saw a sign saying ""9K to go"". I realised I could still reach my goal, and was thankful I hadn't slowed down when I'd been receiving fake splits.

&amp;#x200B;

A super friendly woman with a steady gate started chatting to me. Now we were almost finished descending, and were rounding corner after corner of undulating luscious rainforest trail. She told me she'd run the UTA100 and the Tarawera 100 recently, and come 2nd in her category, and if ""an old bird like me can keep powering along at a healthy clip, so can a young lad like you"". That made perfect sense, and so I sat in her slipstream, enjoying how steady and effortless her pace was. I ""sprinted"" the last stretch to childishly overtake a few runners hoping to improve my position, but they were from other races. Snuck in with a couple of minutes up my sleeve :)

&amp;#x200B;

The organisers were fantastic, they had free beers ready to go. Everyone I chatted to was down-to-earth and friendly, and I'd also like to give a huge shout-out to the New Zealand running community who were incredibly welcoming and helpful, sourcing me gear that I'd left in Australia, and inviting me to hang out and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Whoop whoop!

Thank you in advance for the help!",1570812933
ultrarunning,escapestrategy,Rest days?,"Looking for some advice for rest days. I'm beginning to draw up a training plan for my first ultra (either a 50K or a 50 miler) and I'm going to base it off one or two solid ones I've found. I got through marathon training feeling good and fresh, and uninjured, running 5 days a week (2 or 3 of these days I'd also do some light strength training), crosstraining (biking or swimming) 1 day, and having one completely ""lazy day"" in which I barely walked the equivalent of half a mile to give my legs time to recuperate. 

How often do you generally take a rest day in the midst of training? I'm thinking some weeks I'll do one and some weeks I'll do one complete rest and one crosstrain, maybe alternating back and forth? My ultimate goal is just to maintain my record of no serious injuries, but I don't want to undertrain.

ultrarunning,StinkyWaffles,First 50k tomorrow!,"Feeling pretty anxious but really excited to run the Pilot Mountain to Hanging Rock ultra in beautiful western/central NC tomorrow. 

I probably didn’t train enough, running about 30-35mpw pretty consistently with a long run of 20mi. I’ve done a few half marathons, 10mi trail races, and a few Ragnar Trail races, but never a marathon, so this should be an adventure. 

My goal is to finish with dignity (sub 7hr would be nice but going to try and not worry about time), have fun with some buddies, and wake up on Sunday (or maybe Monday!) with the feeling that I’d like to do more ultras. 

Any words of wisdom or encouragement as I patiently wait for tomorrow? 

Have fun out there y’all!",1570807032

ultrarunning,isthewonder,Will donating a kidney crush my dreams?,"I recently found out that I likely did not inherit my mother's thyroid disorder, making me eligible for a non-directed kidney donation. This is something I'd really like to do, but I'd also really like to run a 100 miler before I turn 30. (I'm 27 now.) I'm reading ""Eat and Run,"" and Scott Jurek keeps talking about kidneys, kidneys, kidneys. Can I run 100 miles with just one kidney? Should I wait until after I finish the race to donate? Is wanting to run an ultra an excuse to put off saving a stranger's life? (Please excuse me if this is the wrong sub for this. I'm a little intoxicated. Obviously I will ask an actual doctor before making any decisions.)",1570761857
ultrarunning,screepatrol,What are your favorite podcast episodes regarding mental strength/endurance/adventure?,"""Try the dirtbag diaries"" -- that's not what I'm asking. SINGULAR episodes. ""Trying out"" podcasts is much too tiresome for me, personally

Some of my faves:

*Outside Magazine Podcast: Sweat Science -- The Hour*, they have an episode about a woman setting a record for ""The Hour"" road bike race. Talks about how the classic rules surrounding recovery and endurance don't apply to every situation, and takes a scientific look at pain threshold in endurance athletes vs non athletes

*Dirtbag Diaries: the Punk Rockers of Ski Mountaineering* two  mountaineers traverse the North Cascades by ski over 30 days, mostly self supported. The theme is great adventure can be created in your local spots.",1570736151

ultrarunning,Teroc,How much racing is too much racing?,"Hello everyone,

I'm planning my races for next year and I'm wondering if I'm not going a bit overboard.

I've already signed up for a 100k early June. I want to sign up to the Snowdon 24 in early July (I'm doing some recce next weekend first to check what I'd sign up for...). I have enough ITRA points for the CCC (52k race of the UTMB) at the end of August so I was going to try and apply, though it's unlikely I'll get in. If I don't, I already have my eyes on other races in August. I also found a nice 52k race in early May that I'd quite like to do, but I'm starting to wonder if it might not be a bit much.

Usually my recovery is pretty good. I did a 100k and a 50k three weeks after and I was fine. Not in my best 100% shape, but still ok. That'd still be one race a month. I guess the most annoying part is the training in between races. With 1 or 2 weeks of recovery after a race, you can never ramp back up before the next one.

What do you think?",1570694453

ultrarunning,MarsRage,Trekking poles and knee health?,"I have my second 50k coming up and I am fairly under trained due to some knee injuries and other issues over the past few months.  My knees currently feel alright but I still have some concern that they won't last the entire 50 km, about 3400 ft of gain and some parts moderately technical.  I have some decent trekking poles that I can use  but I have never used trekking poles other than some testing in this past week and feel like they may help alleviate some of the weight on my legs at least for the ascents and descents.  Would it be stupid to try something new like this on a 50k or would the possible benefit outweigh the risks?",1570628019
