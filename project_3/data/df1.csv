I’ve researched some training plans for the weeks leading up to the race, but curious what others experience is of building to &amp; staying in shape for ultras.

Do you just keep mileage high and build the base? Hold constant and then add more hills / speed work? Take longer breaks after a race then do a 12-16 week training plan?",1632472993

Ultramarathon,ultratraileric,Continuing training after 50k plan is finished,"I am using a 50k plan that I have used in the past to build my base back up after having a few years of injuries/surgeries (not running related).  Earlier this year I had planned to run a 50 miler, but felt like I was rushing the training and ultimately dropped my race distance down.  Then I decided to take the summer off cause I had a case of the ""Fuck its"" while still running some (20 mpw avg) to run a half marathon at the end of the summer.  Now I am in the planning stages for next year without a specific race in the early season, but one in August that I rolled over from this year.  

With that said, my initial layout has my 50k plan ending 9 weeks prior to my goal race (August) and am wondering if I should just transition to the 50m/100k plan prior to the taper of the 50k plan to continue training and find a 50m/100k to do in the fall sometime?

My main goal is that I was in the best shape I had been in a decade going into my first 50k after completing the 50k plan I mentioned and I'd like to get back to that.  Then use that as a base to run some 50ks, then get back to a 50 miler and eventually run a 100 miler without rushing the training.",1632325532

Ultramarathon,milesandmileslefttog,Race Report | Plain 100,"A few weeks ago I asked for your thoughts on [switching from marathon training for an ultra in four weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/pa3iq4/converting_from_marathon_to_100m_in_4_weeks/). Here is my follow up race report!

Plain 100 is a little different. Outside of the start/finish/one aid station, no outside help is allowed. This means you have to know the course and also have to be prepared to carry water and supplement from streams. The course is also not marked, so you need a GPS or analog map. The course consists of a 62 mile loop and a 45 mile loop. At the aid station at the end of 62 miles, you can get all the help you want in the form of food, moral support, map guidance, etc..., but can't get so much as a cheer from anywhere on the loop. The radio check in points are also not allowed to help you, or even point you in the right direction.

I have been training for a road marathon, aiming for 3:10. It's been years since my first marathon, and I was curious if all of my trail running had made me faster. But then it looked like I'd get one last chance to run the Plain 100, a race that was my first 100k but that in subsequent years I hadn't been able to run the 100 mile version due to fire, injury, and covid.

### Training
Starting at the end of April after a very underwhelming previous 8+ months due to life stress, I ramped up mileage with a specific focus on speed and running form. Mostly this involved a lot of strides mid easy run, as well as 1k on/off repeats at half marathon pace and MP+10s, and some track work. I really enjoy speedwork more at more. The past several weeks before I asked about training were in the 65-75mpw range, with one week hitting 85 miles.

Based on a lot of suggestions here and on /r/artc and /r/advancedrunning (I think I asked in both places), I did the following in the previous 4 weeks:

- Week 4 (65 miles): 1 downhill 2xmile on road, running fairly hard downhill to get my quads some downhill running resistance. Everything else the same as marathon training since I thought I probably wouldn't get in off the waitlist. That consisted of one tempo run and one track workout, as well as longer runs on Friday and Sunday. 
- Week 3 (45 miles): A smokey week that made running outside difficult and I simply do not have the mental strength to conquer the treadmill for hours at a time. I had a lot of track stuff previously scheduled, so this included a Tuesday local ""track meet"" and a Saturday 5k time trial. I supplemented with additional trail time Saturday afternoon and treadmill running for 20 minutes at 15% incline. I got that last idea from a David Roche article. Thursday AM I had a gym session because my friend is recovering from surgery so we can't run together, but we can work out together. That was 4x6 of Deadlifts, Bulgarian Split Squat, Reverse Lunge, and Jump Squat. Sometime in the middle of this week I got in off the waitlist so I knew the race was on.
- Week 2 (68 miles): The smoke cleared and so did my schedule. On Friday I did a fastish 15 road miles, Saturday was 7 miles of trail hill repeats on a fairly steep incline, and Sunday was a 17 mile run with full kit. I was borrowing a friend's pack and poles since I'd shipped my poles to flatland and my packs were either too small or too big.
- Week 1 (12 miles + race) nothing special here. I did do a fast 4 mile shakeout on Thursday at MP + 10s. Figured it was too short to make my legs tired but might help keep some of the higher speed fitness for after the 100 miler.

### Nutrition

I think nutrition was a huge factor here. Usually I sort of wing it and just eat from aid stations. This time I had some kind of fancy slow-digesting carb powder that I could mix with water to make a diluted gel, plus a bunch of other food, aiming for 300c an hour. I could basically sip the gel every 20 minutes and eat to supplement.

I did try something else new that worked brilliantly: instant coffee with powdered milk and sugar. Added to a soft flask. It made carrying coffee and cream possible without the additional weight and was delicious. I mixed it with my mostly empty gel flask before filling to keep the other flask pure.

### Race

I've broken these up by approximate radio check in point

| Mile | Time |
|------|------|
| 0-8   | I started in the back to try to force myself to not go out to fast. It sort of worked. I felt good though. |
| 8-25 | Refilled water at about 15m, and had my first taste of the deliciousness that was the instant coffee mix I had made. It's a long ascent and then descent here, still keeping things easy and getting a sense of who was around me. |
| 25-45 | There are 3+ miles of downhill paved road here followed by a 4500' climb over 6 miles. If you rush the downhill, the climb is brutal. It's brutal anyway. The downhill and the climb were some of my biggest worries given my lack of vert training. But it went okay and I managed to stick close to some other runners, although they dropped me at the top. At mile 30 I started the climb carrying almost 2.5L for the 15 miles section with no water. By the end I was dry so it was just about right. |
| 45-55 | Some folks blasted past me on this section, enjoying their downhill running skills. I've never been good at it despite lots of practice, so I took my time. Also I couldn't help thinking I still had 50+ miles to go... At the bottom of the long descent here was a trail following a river, and I made up some good time, passing several folks who had passed me earlier. Despite 21000' of gain, a lot of this course is pretty runmable, which was to my benefit given the road focus I think. |
| 55-62 | The downhill back to the aid station is forest service road, and another section that is tempting to go too fast on. I did okay but tripped about a mile out and scraped my hand up. Nothing too major but the shock is always surprising. |
| 62 | I felt good and was surprised I felt good. I ate three cups of soup and restocked my pack for the remaining 45 mile loop. The other 100 miler I ran I crashed hard at mile 60, so I was happy I felt okay. I delayed my start because a lot of other people hadn't left and they were intimidating and I didn't want to get passed all night. I left in maybe 8th place total. |
| 62-75 | Much of this section was up and down trail that was mostly runnable except for the climbs. Night running agrees with me, and I must have been feeling better than others because I passed several people in the night. |
| 75-100 | At the check in here they told me I was the third runner, and this amazed the shit out of me. I'm a mid-pack runner who maybe gets an age group placement in local races. Not exactly fast. I knew this might be my one chance to podium at a 100 miler, but also knew that there were a lot of fast people behind me probably gaining. For the rest of the race I could hear voices, footsteps, and hiking poles behind me as I was sure they were catching up. This fear kept me going despite realizing I had forgotten to pack more coffee mix and also having a headlamp go dead. From 330-7am I was fiddling with phone flashlight, recharging via battery backup, and spare batteries that, surprise!, were also dead (maybe from the cold). The last 10 miles of this section is a diabolical descent on rocky trails, jeep trails, and dirt road that never seems to end. At least it was light, but I was moving at a snails pace and I was sure that someone was bombing downhill behind me. I tried to run as much as I could. |
| 100-107 | Reaching the bottom of the final descent and knowing I had about 7 miles of up and down trail to run, I thought I just might have a chance. I took off pretty fast and within about 2 minutes was hurting and moving really slow. I managed to eek out some 15-20 minute miles for the remaining unending section, and came into the finish in disbelief. It was over! |

### Thoughts

Being relatively runnable, I think my road training helped more than I thought it would. Most of my running happens in the 7-8 minute range, and that made 12 minute pace over trails feel really relaxed. I think the downhill pavement running helped a lot because I never had trouble with blown quads, although I was in rough shape for the descent at mile 90-100. Some of my climbs were slower than when I ran the 100k version of this race, but not by much, so that didn't slow me down much. And I was much faster on the trail sections that weren't climbs. I'm sure past experience with ultras helped here also, but I came away with the strong impression that nutrition has previously been something I've done very wrong, and it has a huge effect.

Thanks all! Apologies for the length of this...

Ultramarathon,Icy_Trip1779,Notes on my first 50+ miler,"Last weekend I ran a race with a 12 hour format. It was to run as many loops on a 2 mile smooth trail as you could in the 12 hours. Just under 100ft/mile for vert so not much climbing but enough for some variation.

I went in with a goal of completing 50 miles, hopefully under 10 hours. It was my first race or run longer than 50k. I accomplished that goal, coming in for the 50 at 9:25. I was really happy with that. 

Once I hit 50 I really just took it easy for the rest of the time and walked a bunch. My total was 59 miles for the time allotted.

Notes:
-I felt great until mile 40 or so. Then I really started to feel it. Nothing was wrong in particular, I was just tired and my legs were screaming to stop.
- Fueling is a totally different ballgame than for  a 50k and I definitely need to work on it. I needed some real food or better sustenance than my usual Tailwind and maple syrup, but nothing sounded remotely appealing other than bananas.
-Loop course like this have their pros and cons. It was nice to see my drop bag so frequently. It also helped me mentally break things down into small chunks. On the flip side…I ran that same 2 miles for 12 hours.
-Couldn’t sleep the night after at all, was sweaty and achey. However, I was fine doing stairs the next morning and really moving quite well in the days following. Win.
-Overall: very fun, and a great learning experience.",1632134875

Ultramarathon,highplainsdrifter01,Trench Foot Blues,"For years I distance hiked / trail ran in the Dry High Sierra and desert with one pair of thin dress socks and running shoes that were pretty loose. I never got blisters. Now I live somewhere rainy and humid and I'm pushing into longer distances. I noticed that I recently got some blisters after about 30 miles, so I started taping my feet, using Merino wool liner toe socks with Merino running socks over them, applying lubricant, you know all the things that people suggest.  The blisters went away. But, now I find that my feet are pretty macerated and trench foot sets in on wet runs. Just yesterday, after a 50k, I had some irritation under the ball of my foot which seemed to be due to them being wet the entire time. Then my skin came off with the tape which was not awesome. So now I am wondering if it might be best to revert again to one pair of thin dress socks...I'm about to run a wet 100 miler and I'm not sure that encosing my feet in a blanket of wool, tape and lube is the best idea. I'm not able to change shoes every aid station, so I need to find a different solution.

### Training
 My training for an ultra began in August 2020, beginning at about 30 km/week and rising to about 60 km/week by the end of the year. In the lead up to the race, I followed a plan out of the book Relentless Forward Progress, peaking at 80 km/week. I did have some deviations from the plan: I usually ran one less day per week than was in the book and upped the midweek run distance to compensate. The longest run in the plan was 80 km, after doing some research I found that it was recommended that your longest training runs top out somewhere in the 8-9 hour range. An 80 km would likely take me 12 hours or so, so instead I ran a hilly 60 km which ended up giving me 8.5 hours on my feet. The last deviation was during the taper; I was having some tendon pain in my left leg, and in the 3 weeks before the race I ran 48 out of a planned 115 km. Most of my running was done at night after my kids went to bed, with my long runs commonly ending after midnight. I got very comfortable running tired and with a headlamp, which I think helped me a lot during the race. 

### Race
 
The race started at 7 AM with 46 runners. We took off on the shale path and everything felt great. After 2 km the single track started, which meant a long line of runners marching up and down the coulees. The pace was a bit faster than I would have liked to run, but I knew that it wouldn’t last long. Once we hit the first aid station some runners stopped and the line thinned out a bit. I brought enough food and water for the first few legs, so I just kept on running and soon enough the trails were a lot less crowded. Despite this, my pace kept up as the excitement of the race was still fresh. I knew in the back of my head I should slow down, but the weather was nice and cool and my body felt great, so I figured I could let it ride for a few hours. My wife and kids came to see me at the second aid station, and I’m glad they got to see me running in such a good mood!


The 100 mile race at the Lost Soul consists of three 54 km laps. About half way into the first lap, I started to make a conscious effort to slow down, walk more, and get more calories in. I was well ahead of my 9 hour first lap goal, and although my legs still felt good, I knew that I wasn’t taking enough breaks to eat. Sure enough, in the last 20 km or so of the first lap my mood dropped, and I was feeling a bit grumpy for absolutely no reason. I knew if I kept eating it would turn around, so that’s what I focused on. I finished the first lap in 8:30 and got to see my wife and kids again! This time I wasn’t quite so cheerful, but it was still great to see them and the signs and noisemakers they had gave me a big boost. After spending a bit of time in the aid station I took off for my second lap as my son jeered me unknowingly: “Run Daddy, this isn’t a walking race!”


With the fast first lap down, I knew that I had plenty of time to finish the final two laps. My only goal was to finish under the cut-off of 33 hours, so I decided to slow way down and focus on eating and conserving energy for the later miles. I pictured every walking/eating break as an energy deposit that I could draw from later in the race. In the first section of the second lap my mood started to improve, which I was able to keep up for the rest of the race. 


At about 13 hours in, the sun had set and I pulled out my headlamp. The race was incredibly well marked, however in the dark the flags became harder to see. (sometimes the flags would fold over their own reflective sticker) After 13 hours of racing I was beginning to disengage a bit, which led to a few times where I wasn’t sure if I had missed a turn or not. I never actually did miss a turn, I just spent a bit of mental energy worrying if I had, and a couple of times I backtracked a short distance to find a flag. I just put this down to racing inexperience mostly. Around this time was when I started using my caffeinated Nuun tabs, which helped perk me up for the night.


I spent the rest of the second lap plugging away slowly. It had begun to rain on and off, but the trails still felt good and it didn’t affect me. I met a lot of 100 km runners in this section, who only had about 15 km to go. It surprised me to see that nearly everyone I met was not in a good mental state, despite being so close to the finish. I credit my good mood at this point to consistent calories and plenty of experience with night running. On the last few legs of the second lap, I realized that with my plan of moving deliberately slower, my lap time was going to be right around 11.5 hours, which meant that I had 13 hours to finish my final lap. At this point I was confident I could repeat my 11.5 hour lap without too much trouble, so it seemed that my ‘move slowly and eat a lot’ strategy would pay off.


As I finished my lap and came into the aid station, I saw some other 100 miler runners for the first time in many hours. Each lap begins with a 7 km loop that returns to the start/finish line, and after chatting a little bit while refueling I learned these runners had already done that loop. There were five runners there, and they all looked pretty wrecked, lounging deep in chairs near a heater or lying down on air mattresses. This gave me a big boost of energy and I realized I might be able to pick off a few runners on my last lap. I wished everyone good luck and headed out as the rain began to pick up. My plan was to go the same pace as my second lap, and pick it up in the last 20 km or so if I had anything left in the tank.


The third lap started well, and I saw another couple of headlamps that were on the back half of the loop which continued to grow my confidence. I was moving well in the rain for the first 20 minutes on the shale paths and asphalt, but then I came to the first climb of the lap. I couldn’t get up the first 10 foot section, as the rain had turned the trail into a slip and slide. After failing to get any traction on the trail for a few tries, I realized the only way up was to hike on the side of the trail, climbing with my hands when necessary. It was still slippery off the trail, but I could make slow progress. As I came over the top of the long, slow climb and into the descent, I realized that running was out of question. I tried to surf down the trail, however I would pick up speed quickly and fell a few times on this first descent alone.


At the bottom of the hill I realized that I had a new problem; my hands were covered in mud and I was running out of places to wipe them off. This meant that eating would be difficult. I tried to eat some of my snacks with some difficulty before deciding to wear my gloves while running. This way the gloves would get dirty, and I could take them off to eat. In practice my hands just got dirty messing around with my gloves so nothing really got solved.


The rest of the loop was a complete slog. The trails were either flooded or so slick it felt like running on ice. Despite moving slower than I had all race, I was using far more energy and was quickly becoming tired. The descents were the toughest part, with multiple falls and butt slides on each one. During one of the falls I tweaked my knee; I knew I could still run with it on solid ground but on the slippery trails it seemed like I was just asking for an injury. 


As the loop came to an end I had made a decision; if the directors had changed to the wet weather course (all gravel and shale) I would finish the race, but if I had to continue to run on trails then I would have to stop. As I came into the aid station I asked about the situation and was given two options: I could either wait around for ~2.5 hours while they collected runners that were stranded on the course and set up the wet weather loop, or I could take a 100 km finish now. My first thought was that a 100 mile race with a 2.5 hour rest didn’t seem very fair (to the race course? I don’t know, I was tired) as I would have time to regain my energy and refuel. Shortly after thinking this I realized that after a break that long I wasn’t sure I would be able to move at all, and I would need to be constantly moving during the break to ensure that my legs didn’t seize up. On top of that I wasn’t sure how my hurt knee would fare either. After a couple minutes of internal debate, I went over to the timing table and let them know I would take a 100 km finish. My final totals were 114.8 km in 21:56, and the race gave me an official 100 km finish (actually 108 km) of 20:07.


I left the timing table and walked through the finish line. I raised my hands and I think someone cheered. It certainly wasn’t the finish I was expecting and it felt incredibly anti-climactic. I was a bit jealous of the 100 km runners that were running down the final stretch triumphantly to scattered cheers. I sat around for a bit, texting the people who were following my race and chatting with runners that were making it back. Stories of people hitching rides in cars, losing equipment or bushwhacking to the closest aid station made me feel a bit better about my own muddy adventure. Once I heard back from my wife and knew I could get into my hotel room, I made the slow, cold 1 km walk back to the hotel.


Overall I’m a little disappointed with the result. I went to Lethbridge to run 100 miles, and have no doubt that had the trails held up I could have done it under the cut-off time. I held back on my second lap in preparation for a third lap I didn’t get to run, so it doesn’t really feel like a true 100 km effort either. On the other hand, running 115 km in my first ultra is something I can be proud of, and I’m excited to use the experience I gained in the future.

It suddenly occurred to me tge other morning how addicted to caffeine I am, after a more experienced friend told me to avoid coffee before amd during the race(bc it's a diuretic and also can make you want to no. 2). I realised that avoiding it could trigger feeling crappy withdrawal during the day, an extra stress to tax mind and body. I'm therefore considering a caffeine pill here and there as cravings demand.

Ultramarathon,hundredhopeful,Mental Strategies in Ultras: How do you manage the highs and lows?,"Hey fellow ultra runners, 

I’m looking to pick your brains and maybe gain a few useful nuggets of advice to take into my next ultra. I’ve done a 100K, a handful of 50 Milers, and a few 50Ks and road marathons. 

Recently had a blowout race where I finished 2nd out of 100+ in a 50 miler (went into it just hoping my goal time would place me top 10). Felt awful through miles 5-15 and 30-40.. seemed to find a second wind after these lows, but also lost quite a bit of precious time sulking and feeling sorry for myself. 

I still consider myself a “newbie” in the sport. I’m in my late 20s, started running in my early 20s, and do my long training runs with a group of “veterans” who have done a lot more races than me. I feel relatively up to speed with the common wisdom on training blocks, gear, fueling, pacing strategy, etc. 

It’s become increasingly clear that ultras are made or broken with the Mental Game. The old saying goes something like, “for every high, there is a low.. for every low, there is a high..” So I’ve gotten better at accepting before the race that I will A) Feel amazing for some of it and B) Feel crappy for some of it. It seems important to just keep moving during the lows and maybe hold back a touch during the highs in an attempt to even the mental peaks and valleys out and keep your relative pace consistent throughout. 

Sorry for the long intro, but with these ideas in mind, what mental strategies do you use to manage the mental highs and lows in a race? Do you have a mantra you tell yourself? Do you seek a feeling of gratitude? Think back to your training for strength? Take in some additional sugar/calories? Try to focus on the setting and nature? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Ultramarathon,scrimbibbly,Beginner’s luck and beginner’s misfortune: the Grand Traverse,"September 4th, 2020
Crested Butte to Aspen
40.5 miles

First ultra in the books! Thank you to all those in this sub who helped answer the questions I had along the way. 

The beginning: 
We started the day just before sunrise at 6am, winding our way around the base of Mount Crested Butte with views of the foggy valley below peeking out between Aspen groves. My running partner and I were feeling great, riding high on the energy of race day. We had signed up for the Grand Traverse spur-of-the-moment back in May, inspired by a particularly fun day of trail running. We are not inexperienced runners, but brand new to ultras and both coming off long breaks from running. We had trained hard all summer and were excited to see what we were capable of now that we had finally reached the start line. I knew we were both a bit undertrained given our short training period, but fully believed that we were both capable of finishing. 

Four miles in, my running partner stumbled and tripped, her arms flying out in front of her. I had done the same thing a couple weeks earlier, ending up with a nasty bruise on my knee that had mostly stopped aching in time for race day. I figured she’d be dealing with a nice scrape and bruise too, but nothing she couldn’t run through. She hopped up and turned towards me, and I felt the color leave my face. Instead of blood, I saw the white of fatty tissue and bone. She cried out in shock and stumbled backwards off the trail. A couple that had been just behind us immediately offered their assistance, pulling out a much more equipped med kit than my own. Another runner who happened to be a nurse stepped in to help as well. I was so appreciative for these kind and selfless people who I knew were giving up precious time. Fortunately, we still had service and I contacted race support, figuring out how we could get my friend off the trail and down the nearest road. After our new friends had her wound sufficiently compressed, she and I began a slow journey back the way we had came, towards a trail that would lead us down towards a service road. We were both heartbroken, knowing that the day had ended before it had even really began. We ran into the sweep along the way and explained what had happened and where we were headed. Ten or so minutes later, he appeared back behind us on the trail. “Hey, I just spoke to race support, and they said that you should continue on if you’d like. I can help your friend the rest of the way down.” I looked back and forth between the sweep and my friend. “Go!” she yelled. “Are you sure?” “Yes, go!!” Well, I thought, this is not the way either of us pictured the day, but I had to at least try. I took off back the way we’d came, trying to move as fast as I could while knowing that I risked burning myself out. I was at least 45 minutes behind the last group of runners, and I was going to be cutting it close to making the first cutoff at 11:15am at the top of Star Pass. I had to push the pace, otherwise there was no point in continuing on. I knew I was going to be lucky to pull this off, but I was so grateful for the opportunity to continue and I had to try. 

I only saw one other runner in the span of almost an hour, and my doubts continued to grow. Before the first aid station, a supporter with a giant sombrero and a cowbell cheered me on. “How far behind do you think I am?” I asked. “Don’t worry about that, you just run your own race!” “No really, how far behind am I?” “You just run your own race, this is about you!” Yikes, I thought. While I did appreciate the sentiment, there was clearly no hope for me. I was too far behind. I kept pushing, finally passing two other women at the first wet stream crossing at Brush Creek just before Aid 1, 9.5 miles in. A handful of other runners were still at the station, and I breathed a small sigh of relief knowing that I was finally starting to catch up. I just had to keep moving forward.

The middle: 
As I left the aid station, the knee I had bruised a couple weeks prior seized up. I limped my way along. Great, I thought. Not even 10 miles in and it’s already giving me problems. There’s no way I can make it if this doesn’t let up. But, sure enough, it loosened back up and I was feeling good again. It stiffened up every time I stopped moving throughout the day, but the pain was always temporary. 

I moved through Death Pass escarpment onto East Brush Creek jeep road, where I slowly began to pass other runners. It wasn’t long before the trail started to slowly ascend towards Star Pass. By this time, I had caught up to the couple that had supplied their med kit and helped take care of my friend. I kept pace just behind them, finally feeling like I had a good chance of making the Star Pass cutoff. I followed them all the way to the top of the pass, making the cutoff with 30 minutes to spare. We chatted for awhile as we descended the pass, and I let them know how thankful we were for their help. I had 2 hours to make it 6 miles to the next cutoff at mile 23.5, the summit of Taylor Pass, and I had regained much of my confidence by this point. I was still feeling strong and had managed to avoid any stomach or feet issues, my two worries. 

I powered through to Taylor Pass, once again arriving 30 minutes before the cutoff. I restocked what I needed to from my drop bag and headed towards Richmond Ridge. There were no more cutoffs after this. I could see the Maroon Bells just behind another mountain range to my left. I knew I was going to make it. I kicked my hiking muscles into gear and moved up and over Richmond Ridge, realizing part way up that I had just completed my first marathon. 

I rolled in to Aid 4 at mile 29. I had 11 miles to go. I could feel some blisters beginning to form between my big toes. I should have reapplied Aquaphor after the last wet crossing, but it was too late now. I kept moving. I was finally beginning to feel the weight of the day. I moved through much of the next 5 miles alone, finally catching up to some other runners as we got closer to Aid 5. This gave me the motivation I needed to pick up the pace. I was getting so close. 

The end: 
I reached the final aid station at the top of Aspen mountain at 3:30pm. I knew that this final stretch was supposed to be brutal, descending 3,200 feet over five miles. The knowledge that was actually going to cross the finish line spurred me on, and I bombed it downhill as fast a I could without completely destroying my quads or risking a wipe out. At this point, the blisters were finally starting to get to me but it really didn’t matter. I was going to make it. Those 5 miles seemed to keep going and going, and the trail got steeper and steeper to the point where I almost wanted to scoot down on my butt in certain sections. It was the only time during the day where I wished I had poles. 

Finally, I rounded the corner into Ajax Park. My husband, my now patched-up friend, and her boyfriend were awaiting me. My friend and I immediately embraced. It was a bittersweet ending to a journey that we had started together and had planned to end together. I knew I would never have even made it the start line had it not been for her, and I had channeled her throughout the day all the way through to the finish line. I felt so grateful to have made it there and for the incredible support system waiting for me. Fortunately, while she did need plenty of stitches, my friend’s injury didn’t damage any bones or tendons. I know she’ll be back up and running in no time at all, and there will be mountains waiting for her. 

TLDR: Trained hard for the Grand Traverse. Four miles in, I thought both myself and my running partner were done for thanks to a perfectly placed rock and an unlucky fall. After getting my friend to safety, I was given the opportunity to continue but didn’t know if I could catch up in time to make the cutoffs. Managed to reach the cutoffs in time and make it across the finish line! I know my friend will get her opportunity to do the same.",1631037338

I am halfway through a 2 week taper leading up to my 50 mile race on 9/11. I ended on a good note. But had a niggle in my hip and so took 3 days off. On this past Thursday when I was going to run I took a knee to put my shoes on and just above my left knee hurt to bend. I have zero pain/discomfort when walking or moving. I always take the stairs up and down at work, zero issues there. It is just that near 90 degree bend motion. I went to jujutsu class the night before and we did kicks, I took them super slow and easy and never felt any twinges during class. This pain/discomfort is still there today, but only when making that bend motion. It is probably a 2 or 3 out of 10. Any else have any issues pop up on tapering that seem to come out of nowhere?

Ultramarathon,highplainsdrifter01,I Finally Settled the Poles vs No-Poles Debate and Here's How,"After being someone who poked fun at those who poked the ground, I have converted. 

The way I figured out that poles are my friend was to wear myself out doing some back-to-back steep, techy long runs over two days. Then, instead of resting on the second day, I set out for a longer run on some even steeper and more techy terrain (similar to what I will be running in my first 100 miler in October).  I carried some cheap poles with me (for the first time in a couple of decades of fastpacking and mountain jogging) and found them super useful on the climbs. They supported my posture and gave my upper body a way to help my lower body...this was the part that I always doubted. I figured that if you ""need"" poles it means you are undertrained and that involving my upper body would just cause other problems in other places. What I didn't realize is that the poles helped my slower miles become more enjoyable and safer. While climbing they also seemed to help me keep a good rhythm, like a drummer who is locked in on the beat with all four limbs. 

During the steep downhills, the poles enabled me to add extra support especially on the big 2 to 3 food step-downs where the trail was eroded.  This seemed to save my knees from the acute angle knee bend pain. When I didn't need them I just carried them - no big deal. When blackberries tried to snag me, I pushed them out of the way with the poles. That was an added bonus. I even fought off a horsefly. 

Overall, I felt like I ended the session with more energy and less lower leg pain than I have in the past. So, I am sorry for poking fun at those who aerate the edges of the trails and am happy to share that I have joined your club.",1630417389
Ultramarathon,FluffyTurdBiscut,looking for advice - going from thru hiking to running,"Just finished my first thru hike and very inspired to eventually get into ultra running. My current goal is to run a road marathon in the spring. 

I've never ran more than about 2-3 miles in one go, but after hiking 30 miles a day for weeks at a time, surely I'm capable of running marathon?? It's not even a question of if I can do it, it's more like how fast.

Any advice from thru hikers who got into running? How long should I take to recover post thru hike? I'm going to be a student in the fall again so I only have access to running on roads and bike paths. How do I find a marathon training plan that suits my ability? I can walk very well but have never actually ran before so it's hard to tell where I'm at. 

Finally, what type of shoes should I look into wearing? I'm used to walking in altra superiors, low stack, low cushion, zero drop. I see that road shoes tend to have a lot of cushion and drop.

Ultramarathon,highplainsdrifter01,More Time on Feet vs Starting too Fast,"I have read some advice about trying to aim for a negative split in a 100 so that you don't blow the whole fitness wad in the first half.  Starting a 100 miler at close to the pace I plan on finishing seems painfully slow, but maybe that's the best idea? For an event I am considering with lots of elevation (25k), esp at the end, this would essentially equate to 'power walking' 18-20 min miles out the gate and possibly not speeding up. That seems very slow, but def safer than trying to run in the beginning (the goal would be to finish feeling as good as possible).

I estimate 6 litres of liquid as I used 2 litres for my 50 km distance and the temp high high for that day was 37˚C,  I worked out that I should triple it for that distance.

Don't want to sound whiny but I don't have anyone else in my entourage that is into running so here it goes, happy to hear your take on this.

Long story short, I finished my first Ultra (a very technical 80km with 3600m d+) a week ago. It was also my first running race/event since I've been only running for a year and a half (im 25)... and my first time really running in trails. I finished in 17:10 since I know I spent way to much time at the 5 aid stations (between 15 minutes and 1h10). I was the second to last male and within 50 minutes of the cutoff, therefore I'm wondering if I really ""deserve"" to say to myself that I ran an ultra since people can't probably walk faster than my pace. The d+ really took a toll on me since I barely got 300m of road vert per week during my training.

I did four 45+ km's this year and for two of those I took 4 days and my last walks before the breaks were 36 km's each, the 50 km I did I took 5 days off and the last walk before the break was 38 km but the extra day I do not think made much of a difference. My last 45+ km was done a day after I did a 38 km walk but that was a spur of the moment walk.

 I want to shave some time off so if tapering can help me achieve it I am open to trying it before my next outing. I have 8 weeks before my I am doing a marathon but I plan on doing the extra miles to make it a 50 km outing so I am wondering if I wanted to try tapering if I left it to late?

The ultra is on Sept 4, a 40 miler. I had planned to do my longest run (26mi for a 50 mile peak week) this past weekend, and taper from there (80%, 50%, 20%). I ended up getting sick last week and had to cut my long run in half. My legs felt good, but the rest of my body was wiped from being sick and I just could not push through. I’m feeling MUCH better this week and figured I’d just do my 26 miler this weekend (for a 50 mile total week) and cut straight down to 50% next week. I’ve been getting 40 mile weeks in pretty consistently the last month, and was really hoping to hit that 50 mile peak week 4 weeks out. 

If I do 26 this weekend to hit my 50 mile peak this week, is that a reasonable amount of time to recover before September 4th? Or am I doing something I’ll regret later? After reading some of the other taper posts on this sub, I’m starting to question myself.",1629236280

I’ve been averaging 90-120km per week (with reduced volume weeks every fourth week or so) since Spring. I live in the Netherlands which obviously makes hills an issue. The best I can do is twice weekly repeats on an artificial hill that gives 35m, so I’ve been doing stairs up one side of it then bombing down the otherside. 90mins on there gives me 15k and 650m or so. However I ran the Eiger Ultra Trail 4 weeks ago (52km, 3100m vert) without any issues so I figured I’ve done all I can at this point. 

Aside from just decreasing volume (115km last week, 80km planned for this week, 50km for next…) is there anything I should worry about at this stage?

This year, 2021, was the first year of existence after three years of dreaming by race director Sean Harrasser of Wonderland Running. The Dark Divide has 70,000 acres of roadless terrain. Harrasser advertises this as “NOT AT ALL A BEGINNER LEVEL ULTRAMARATHON,” which is accurate.

Read a detailed report here: [https://thestringbean.co/dark-divide-50k-race-report/](https://thestringbean.co/dark-divide-50k-race-report/)

The race was small. The race had 5 100 mile finishers and 5 DNFs. I think this race will continue to grow a lot over the coming years. The RD is personally invested in this area, he has been going to it for years and finds it as one of his sacred places. It took 3 years for this race to finally come into existence.

I ran the 50k last weekend. Started out casual in about 5-6th place with another runner who was training for the Plane 100m. The race has 9k of vert, so I needed to respect that. On the first big climb up Tongue Mountain, I decided to work my way up into the lead and stayed there. We climbed 5k vert in the first 11 miles and 7k by the first 17 miles. It made for an amazing back half of the course. Juniper Ridge is a true gem of the area even when views are socked in. The last 8 miles feature a cruisy 8 mile downhill forest road - much welcomed after lots of brutal climbing!",1629049685

All this adds up to me thinking it'd be more sensible to take tablets with me rather than powder as they are compact to transport, and super easy to administer. 

My, maybe dumb, question is: Do I need just regular sodium tablets, or those 'electrolyte complex' tablets with potassium and magnesium and all that in too?

I'll be the first to admit I should know this at this stage but I wondered if any more science oriented runners out there might know what's best! I know sodium depletion is the death of a run, but do I need to replenish that other stuff so fast or do I risk having too much K or Mg in my system?

Bonus question: Do you have a large running pack? If so which? I've been toying with the inov-8 ultra Pro 2 in 1 in tandem with some kind of bumbag/belt for maximum food/liquid carrying potential.",1628241672

Ultramarathon,ContentUnicorn,Shoe Rotation,"Hi all, I'm newer to running. I have my first 50K planned for later this fall. I've been listening to running podcasts and one thing that comes up is shoe rotation.

I predominantly run trails with occasional track work. My 50K will be a trail race. I currently run in Altra Superiors for all of my run.

Should I get another pair of somewhat similar trail shoes (Lone Peaks?) and switch back and forth? Or should I get a pair of road oriented shoes and do more road runs to switch it up?",1628198562
Ultramarathon,timxvx,Heartrate issue when slowing down - advice needed,"Hi! I need some advice on heart rate whilst training for longer distances.

My situation in short: I'm 40 and have several years of trail running behind me. I've had a hiatus of about a year, but the last few months getting back into it as I have a 45k (with 2700 d+) in November. I haven't done many races, but ran +45k and plenty of +30k's with some good altitude gain in the past. Yesterday I did a 20k with 850d+ in 2h12 and had plenty left in the tank, so I'm not worried about the 45k.

However, after my race in November I'd like to have my try at something like a 70k, or at least a decent first ultra to start. So I'll have to go slower, a lot slower, if I want to see a finish line. And here's my issue: *when trying to run slower, my heart rate goes way, way up*. When running uphill (even at 60d+/k) at a 7:30 or even 7:00 pace, my rate stays steady at around 145bpm, or maybe goes into zone 3 at 156bpm or something. When I run the same hill slower, say at a 8:30 pace which I reckon would be a more realistic pace for an ultra, it goes up to around 174bpm then to above 180bpm, and I have to walk or stop to avoid damage. This happens on flats as well.

I don't do a lot of cross training. No street running. No real tempo runs or intervals. I do hill reps every week or two (4 to 5k to get 70d+/k). Now, I know breathing can have a serious impact on heart rate (I once ran with a chewing gum in my mouth and was at a constant +180bpm with minimal effort, simply because I wasn't breathing right), but that doesn't seem to be the cause.

So, my question: how do I train for something longer after my race in November (I'm aiming for a 7:00 to 7:30 pace) to improve my heart rate when running slower? Is it as easy as simply powering through with a heart rate which doesn't give me a lot of aerobic benefit? Has anyone else experiences a good heart rate with higher effort and then gets in trouble when slowing down?

Any advice is very welcome, thanks!",1628192000

Ultramarathon,JTisLivingTheDream,Ultra-running &amp; Keto update,"So I've been trying the Keto/Fat Adaption for the purpose of trying to be more efficient in ultras, not requiring sugar/carbs that tend to create GI issues 6+ hours into races.   I'm on week 7 of the nutrition (diet) and week 12 of a training plan.  

Initially, for the first 4-5 weeks of the diet I felt really sluggish on my runs.  Heart rate was higher than normal.  I had to run/walk some daily runs.  Very discouraging.   I did lose some weight, in the 12-15 lbs range.

I've learned a lot about diet and food choice, reading labels for the first time. the r/Keto forum has been good, but I feel most folks there are not endurance enthusiasts.   I have to say the diet is pretty limiting (especially since I don't eat red meat).  

The last 2 or 3 weeks, I've started to feel a little better on runs &amp; long runs.  Down a total of 15-18 lbs.  And I'm now able to run at a steady HR of 138-142 for 90 minutes before it starts to drift.  I was able to run 2:30 on just water.  But I will say, while I feel lighter and a bit freer on the trail, I don't feel I have the full springiness I normally did.    

The other big learning with transitioning to Fat Adapted is how much more water I need.  A couple of weeks ago, I got pretty dehydrated that triggered some back nerve pain.  I just happened to weigh myself the night before the long run; and in the 2:30 hour run (which I drank 50+ ounces), I lost 11 lbs.  Obviously that was all water weight, but highlighting how much more is needed on this nutrition plan.

Any Ultra / Endurance folks have any advice for diet before, during or after long runs.  I've heard some FA athletes use gels/carbs only during long runs.  Others still only use fats (bacon/MCT) during runs.  

What about electrolytes?  Nuun? Salt tabs?  nothing?  

Recovery - any protein? more fat? just water?",1628025864
Ultramarathon,sliz_315,Classic “should I sign up for an ultra” post,"I lurk here often and I know this is common. Just wanted to throw my info out there and see what you seasoned professionals think.

I have a bad habit of falling out of shape after a race. But I’m also super motivated if (and sometimes only if) I have something on the books I know I need to train for.

I’ve run a half marathon four time’s and my longest effort was a 15.5 mile trail run starting at midnight with a buddy. I live in Raleigh NC so most of my training is road but I have access to trail for long runs. The last “long” run I did was an unofficial half with friends during covid last year (November). My plan was to parle that into marathon training but I have a 1 year old and 4 year old and all of that plus covid was just too much and I fell out of it again.

I’m feeling motivated again (and frankly my mental health needs this) and I’m trying to decide what to sign up for to motivate me. I’m enamored by the idea of ultras but I’m also not naïve. So it’ll either be a marathon or a 50k. And I’m eyeing next spring or so to give myself plenty of time. I also wouldn’t be upset if you suggested like a trail marathon or something of the sort. I’ve never done an official trail race so going straight for ultra distance might not be super smart. Just curious what you all think.",1628025055

I'm trying to complete a 100km (60m) military march in 24h. Running is not strictly forbidden but it is certainly not expected.

Ultramarathon,emptytrashbagobject,How much road running and/or track work do you do training for a mountain/trail 50k (or longer)?,"I run every day and probably at least 90% of my runs are on trails - because that's where I live and so I don't have to drive anywhere to run.  But, sometimes I really just enjoy doing a long flat run or short flat speed work.

I was wondering what the normal breakdown is for most people (who maybe don't live on the side of a mountain) for how much of your running is on trails and how much is off trails?  Including maybe the types of runs you do on and off trails - like track work, intervals, hill intervals, threshold/tempo runs etc.   

Again, I really enjoy the ""pure running"" feeling of flat runs where I'm not watching every root/rock and I guess wonder if those sorts of runs still have a benefit for training for mountain/trail runs.

Ultramarathon,MrDilkington1,I'm at the end of my tether. I'm looking for knee recovery success stories. Please help.,"I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

Just please someone tell me a positive fuckin story I can relate to...

Ultramarathon,blxcklst,Salomon vs Camelbak hydration vests for 6+ hour trail runs?,"I'm looking to buy a hydration vest that can be used with a bladder, for 30+ mile (ideally up to 50/100 mil distances but I've got a 30 mile mountain race in 2 months so primarily for that!) trail runs, usually quite hilly so it's at least 6 hours at a time (my 30 miler will have aid stops every 10 miles but i'd rather be overprepared than under).

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Ultramarathon,the-yiddish-warrior,How do you count hiking into training?,"We all know training for an ultra takes a lot of time. Especially long runs where I feel like I leave my wife for an entire weekend day, and this sometimes causes friction for us. However, she loves hiking and along with my training we have been doing a ton of hiking. Sometimes I'll even hike a trail with her and then turn around and run it afterwards, we live in a van so she doesn't mind waiting in the parking lot. 

I know the hikes aren't nothing but thus far I haven't considered them a part of my training, though I have definitely skipped training days after a particularly grueling hike.

I was wondering how/if y'all would count hikes towards weekly milage goals. Could they be counted as half miles? Full miles? A separate but still useful activity similar to other cross training? Look forward to hearing what you think.",1627134946

Ultramarathon,gareth_e_morris,How to Train for Hardrock 100-like Race,"I have an entry to a new race which is being run for the first time in December next year: it's a 100 mile mountain race with something like 11,000 metres / 37,000 feet of cumulative altitude gain down here in NZ (see  [Adventure | The Wild 100 | New Zealand](https://www.thewild100.co.nz/) ). Unlike Hardrock it is at moderate altitudes (max 1800 metres / 6000 feet. I will have at least 8 months to dedicate to training for this race, which will be my ""A"" race for the year and expect to go into this in pretty decent shape.

How do I best use this time to train for this race?

I'd be really interested to get people's views, hints tips and experiences of this sort of thing.

**Other Information:**

* I'm looking to finish well within the cutoff of 50 hours, but am not going to be near the front of the race.
* I have run several 100k trail races (sub-12h) and one 100 mile trail race (sub-24) before, as well as at least a dozen 50k - 50 mile trail runs and races on road and trail.
* I can dedicate maybe 8 - 10 hours per week to my training including all runs / gym sessions / strength etc... I could possibly bump this to 12 hours for the month before taper.
* I like in an area where I can get a decent amount of hilly running, but only up to climbs of up to 400 metres in altitude gain: this can be on road or trail. I could probably supplement this with a couple of trips to more mountainous places every few months.
* I can run 6 or 7 days per week, but at least 3 days will need to be on road / commute running in order to make this work. I average about 80k / 50 miles per week running over the course of the year.",1627032851

Hey all! I am signed up for the Deadhorse 50mi at the end of November. I've been getting miles in, and back into the habit of as much running as I can. I created a plan to help me gauge everything and looking for some advice!  
The next couple weeks, my longer runs will most likely be HARD vert climbs (peaks, steep trails) to condition a bit more as I am hiking the GR20 across corsica for the days in yellow. It'll be 100+ miles and 45k of vert gain. After that my running will continue as normal. I want to do a 27 mile run for my birthday, as well as the teton crest trail at some point. I have tried to keep the gains per week below 15%, and staying at a max of 60ish.

Let me know what you would change, whats good, whats bad, etc. I am just looking to finish this race!

In 1969, James Burnworth and Stanley Roderfer from San Diego, CA, started the idea of going from the low point (-282 feet) at Badwater, to the top of Mount Whitney (14,505 feet) when they successfully hiked it in two weeks during November. A two-man relay craze started in 1973 as duos sought for the fastest known time. Al Arnold of Walnut Creek, California is credited for accomplishing the first Badwater solo in 1977 to the top of Mt.

I am pacing a friend in her first 100-mile race in 2 weeks (the High Lonesome 100). I will be picking her up at mile 49 and running to mile 68. This section is regarded as the toughest section of the course and I expect much or all of it will be in the middle of the night. It also features the longest stretch in the race without an aid station (a 9.5 mile section). Finally, I've also watched enough Billy Yang films to know that these can be tough miles physically and mentally ;)

My question for this community is: what tips do you have for a first time pacer? Another way to phrase the question is: for those who have done a 100 miler, what things have you been most thankful for from your pacer? I've listened to a number of podcasts with ultrarunners and sports psychologists and I hear often that it is important to ""meet the runner where they are at."" In other words, if they are in a low spot, acknowledge that and troubleshoot it. If they are feeling good, match that enthusiasm, etc. 

Additional context: she is an excellent runner having completed over 10 marathons, several 50ks, and one 50 miler. We recently ran the Leadville Marathon (4 weeks ago) and ran pretty much all 26 miles within a minute or two of one another. So we have very similar fitness levels.

Ultramarathon,Many_Sky,Mileage Range in Training Plans,"I am newer to ultra running, having completed my first 50 miler in June with some 50k and marathon experience.

 I signed up for a 100 miler in May of next year, and many of the mileage plans I have found recommend a pretty wide range of mileage for the same plan. For example, I have Krissy Moehl’s “Running Your First Ultra” book here, and the highest mileage weeks vary in total mileage from 82-94, 85-96, 86-94 and so on. 

I was hitting low 60s without issue in training for the 50 miler and felt great on race day. I guess I am wondering, aside from simply how I feel each week or day alone, should a beginner trend towards the low or high end of mileage for the week? Low seems more intuitive initially, but I could also see high mileage as a nice mental safeguard for newbies.

As I am a complete novice I was just wondering if someone can give me advice on pacing this kind of distance, as I have no idea what is considered a good/average finishing time. Or indeed if an average runner can run it non-stop or whether a combination of running/walking is standard.

Also, a friend said that for ultras, runners have to keep their HR below ~135 otherwise they burn out/bonk... is there any truth in this?

For reference the course I'd be doing is fairly flat for this kind of distance (from what I gather) 2500m (8020ft) total elevation gain, if that helps give some sort of estimate.

Ultramarathon,t-cavalier,Running marathon 3 weeks before 55k,"Hi everyone, 

I'm looking for some advice on some race calendar issues that I have had emerge.

I had initially planned to run this race and switch to the roads to prepare for the Sydney marathon in September. 

I figured with the extra time before my trail race, I could up the distance and tackle the 55 km offering at the event. Herein lies my 'problem', there is only 3 weeks between the Marathon and then the 55 km - if I was to treat the marathon as a long training run, could I use it as my training peak before I start tapering? Or would I not be offering myself enough time to fully recover?

Ultramarathon,AtlasTheEternal,Seeking advice regarding ultramarathon training.,"Hello, people.

I'm a somewhat experienced runner, I've got multiple half-marathons and one marathon behind my back, running 10 km daily is easy for me.

I've decided to run my first ultramarathon (60 km) on the 15th of August this summer, and I'm training all by myself. I'll tell you what I do first.

I restarted running in June 2021, easily reached 10 km on my daily runs by slowly increasing the  distance and did a half-marathon (1 hr 52 mins) on the 19th of June. Then, I started training for the marathon (which I'll run on the 17th of July, in 2 days) by adding 0.5 km every day starting from 10 km. I take  2 days off each week (Thursday and Sunday). Today I reached 21.1 km distance on a daily run, and I feel quite good running 18-20 km distance almost daily. So, after I do the marathon in 2 days, I will once again start increasing my daily run distance by 0.5 km every run, starting from 21 km this time, until I get to 30 km, and after that I'm doing 60 km run (15th of August).

So, if my next big run is 42.2 km, I will increase the distance by 0.5 km every run, starting from 10 km, for example, until I reach half of my big run distance, and I run that every day until the run day. If my  next goal is 60 km, I will increase the distance every run starting from 21 km, until I get to 30, and I do that (30 km) daily until the day of the actual run.

I hope this is comprehensive enough. Feel free to ask more if you think you need some additional info, I'll be glad to provide it. And I'm also looking for general advice on ultramarathon training!",1626326845
Ultramarathon,thestring-bean,For any pain lovers out there - FKT sleep and recovery,"I put pen to paper for my body's breakdown on the AZT. 800 miles in 13.5 days. Figured this would be a fun group to share with.

TL;DR - Sleep was critical to my recovery. I started out sleeping 5 hours per day, and starting day 3 averaged around 4 hours per day. Towards then end, I started splitting my sleep into x2 two hour naps at the beginning and end of night. I eventually hit a hard stop with snow north of the Grand Canyon. At wits end, I got off trail and slept 7-8 hours. That was enough to sustain me for a 25 hour push over the final 75 miles.

The biggest issue I had over the course of the event was tendonitis on my right ankle and foot problems. The desert really did a number on my feet, and I had about 60% mobility on my right ankle for the majority of the effort. While it didn't significantly slow my pace down, I bet it hurt me \~3-5 mpd on the second half.

3 months later, I've gotten over about 2 months of achilles tendonitis and had a new hip injury just surface that I am working through. I still have somewhat tight hammy's and think that the hip/hamstring/achilles are all related.

Curious to hear any thoughts on this, particularly around others experiences around sleep/recovery around multi-day events!

Ultramarathon,runner_1005,Nutrition for faster ultras,"I've been doing ultras for a few years and felt like I had my nutrition dialed in - gel at 30 mins, snack bar at 60, grab something from aid stations and maybe add 100kcal in Tailwind per hour depending on the race and water availability. I've always done well on races with a reasonable amount of powerhiking when I can use a good steep climb to recover and refuel.

Recently though I'm moving towards faster stuff - not that the distances are decreasing, but I'm looking to run a greater percentage and I'm flirting with being competitive. During my last race - a completely flat route, that I ran 99% of - the snack bars took longer and longer to force down, despite the temp being moderate (about 22c I think.) I managed a sub 8 hour 30 fifty miler but didn't have the race I was expecting (for starters, I'd signed up for 100 miles.) I found my energy levels seemed to vary a lot within a short period, and in the end ridiculous as it sounds I couldn't face the idea of eating for another 50 miles. The gels were fine (and always have been) and I was actually doubling up on Tailwind, so getting about 200kcal an hour extra, so I must have been pushing 400-430kcal an hour intake. I gather we struggle to take in much more than 300kcal an hour, could I have been overdoing it and actually over-feeding?

I will point out at this stage that I don't (currently) plan to follow the advice of going for real foods - I know how savoury food is much more appealing, I've experienced that many times when terrain and vert has dictated more powerhiking and I get that it can be effective. But it was the thought and sensation of eating that was putting me off and I'd like to treat that as a plan B.

I'm thinking to either double up on gels (i.e. one every 30 minutes) or go for 1 gel every 45 minutes, plus 2 scoops (200kcal) of Tailwind per bottle. My only slight concern there is that I've found that in the UK water availability can vary widely even within the same race, and I've only ever treated as a bonus for this reason.

But I'm open to other ideas too.

So. After the rambling post, my questions to those of you that truly 'run' 50 milers, 100k's and 100 milers - do any of you rely on the processed gel and energy drinks for your energy? Is this a bad idea? Could forcing too many calories down have been counter productive?",1626089710

Ultramarathon,fasterthinker,Help wanted - 10 week transformation required,"Hi,

Yesterday I just about managed to finish my 4th 50km Ultra. It took a very disappointing 7hrs, my slowest yet, in perhaps the best conditions/course.

The reason is clear…lockdown was not kind to me. I’ve been pretty much sat in front of zoom calls for the past 18 months, with 2 young kids requiring any spare time.

I’m, at least 10kg overweight (am a big bloke anyway as an ex-rugby player), but I know this weight will come off with consistent training. That’ll make a huge difference.

My build up to this ultra in the 7 weeks before was:
W1 - 9.5km
W2 - 24km
W3 - 0km (?!)
W4 - 48km
W5 - 9km
W6 - 58km
W7 - 16km (and a calf strain…which meant I rested to the event).

So the good news is that there is plenty of room for improvement in training!

I have 10 weeks now to prepare for my next 50km. And training should not be an issue.

My goal is hardly lofty: a sub 6hrs (59m59secs will do).

I always die (even previous better performances) at 30km - no doubt due to lack of long training runs). I start getting g over taken by everyone…

I would appreciate thoughts/an outline programme on.

Mileage per week for the 10 build up weeks with the suggested longest run per week. So nothing to prescriptive as life/work/family happens. But I know I have time for one longer run per week and can squeeze the rest in.

The good news is that I’m running on the terrain of the event. 

Thoughts/advice please.

I plan on running my second marathon in mid january. I'm averaging about 25-30 mpw with the summer humidity in the south right now. I'm doing a lot of short runs, with the longest being around 7-8, easy runs are around 10 minute miles, tempo and workouts I do in the 8-9 ranges.

I Intend to crank up the volume to around 40-50 mpw for preparing for the full. My first marathon I didn't have a high enough volume (peaked at 35, Higdon novice 2) and bonked very hard around mile 20, coming in at 5:09. For context I ran a 1:56 half just 6 weeks later, so I know I have a lot of room to improve on the full and want to get as close to 4 as possible. There's a 51 mile ultra road race in March, about 8 weeks after the full that I really wanna try and do. It has a 12 hour cutoff. Would programming for the full be about on par with what I should do for a 50 miler.

Ultramarathon,jnassiri,Running vs training (1st 50k),"I’m training for my first 50K at the end of September. I did my first marathon of the season about six weeks ago and felt great.

My question is about training versus running. I have a two-year-old son who keeps me very busy. Most weeks I’m aiming to run 40 to 50 miles. I’ve just noticed that every time I try to start following a training plan it sucks the fun out of what is for the most part an escape in my life right now. I enjoy just going out and making sure I’m logging the miles I’m aiming to log. I’m not aiming to complete the race within a certain amount of time I’m just wanting to have my first ultra experience.

Am I being shortsighted by not following a specific training plan?",1625422306
Ultramarathon,12random12,"I DNF'd my tune up race today, should I still run my August race?","I'm currently signed up for the UTMB CCC at the end of August but I'm doubting myself after an injury during a 50 mile tune up. 

This year, I've run 2000km+ so far, and I did a 13 day training block with 10,000m+ of elevation, so I was feeling pretty good about my fitness. 

I signed up for an ""easy"" 50 miler with 5,000ft of elevation. Everything was fine until around the half way point. Below my knee started to hurt. Stretching kept it survivable until it completely blew up at 30 miles. I was forced to wrap it and shuffle to the aid station at 35 miles.  I maybe could have walked it in, but I didn't see the need to aggravate it further. 

I had zero issues with my knee while training, but now I'm worried that this means that my body won't be ready in August. The CCC is about as brutal as 100km races come and my confidence is shook. 

Does anyone else have an experience like this? Did you recover in time for your goal race?",1625347361
Ultramarathon,Claimsprocessor,Poles vs. no poles,"Running the Volcanic 50k in August and it includes 7400 ft of elevation gain. I ran almost an identical route last year in May, and did it with poles- 9.5 hrs. While the poles seemed indispensable that time, I was not going for time, or in a race environment. I imagine that I will be power hiking some of the earlier long climbs, and power hiking most of the later long climbs (1 2500ft climb in 5 miles to start the course, another 800 ft climb at mile 12, and another 2000 ft climb at mile 18-22, other than these significant climbs, it is a fair bit of rolling single track, even flat at times). 

Ran a 2200 ft of gain 50k in April at around 6 hours, for pace info. 

How do you decide whether to use poles or not? Especially on a high(er) elevation course/one with a few significant climbs? 

I’m torn, as hiking with poles is obviously better, and doing rock hopping with poles is better (lots of volcanic rock sections of trail), but running slight uphills and downhills, the poles would be a nuisance to hold/put away.

Ideas?

Ultramarathon,lifestylesportsstudy,What are some ultras you've run that had minimal support?,"By minimal support, I mean the way the race is designed. For example, events that have few aid stations, water-only stations, long distances between aid stations, no pacers or crew allowed, etc...

Also, I'm mostly talking about ultras the way they're done in North America - not Fell running, where only the most minimal of support is the norm. If you have done self-supported efforts, that's cool too, feel free to share, but I'm really curious about actual ultra race events.

I'll start, the one that stands out to me is the Ute 100 near Moab in the La Sal Mountains. I ran the inaugural event and knew what I was getting into. There were long distances between some AS and some of those were water only, which meant carrying calories for about 30 miles at one point. The weather was super hot and there was not enough water on the course without filtering water. Also, at the finish there was no food, only water and beer. It was definitely a minimally supported event compared to almost every other race I've run.",1625258887

Western States 100 runs this Saturday.

In 1974 Gordy Ainsleigh was not the first to cover the course on foot, was not the founder of the race, did not invent trail ultrarunning, and the course was only 89 miles.  But those early pioneers did make huge contributions to the existing ultrarunning sport and its future.

Ultramarathon,IamShartacus,[Adventure Report] Smokies Challenge Adventure Run (SCAR),"*Today's post is brought to you by Vaseline™: For the love of all that is holey, don't leave home without it!*

[Warning to sensitive readers: In case it wasn't clear from that sentence, this report contains way to much information about butt chafing. Ultrarunning is gross, and I'm not here to sugarcoat that fact. You have been warned.]

**Background**
---

The Smokies Challenge Adventure Run, or SCAR for short, is the delightfully melodramatic name given to the 72 mile section of the Appalachian Trail that traverses Great Smoky Mountain National Park. One of the highest  and most remote routes on the east coast, SCAR boasts a formidable 18,000 feet of climbing and descending, tags multiple 6,000' summits, and has just a single road crossing near the half way point, which forces most runners to carry 10+ hours worth of supplies at all times.

I've had this route on my bucket list ever since vacationing in the Smokies in 2015, so when my Michigander-turned-Tennessean friend David White invited me to run it with him, I jumped at the opportunity.

After 13 hours of driving over the course of two days, I found myself at Fontana Dam, which is the southern terminus of the route. I stuffed a duffel bag of clothes and a pair of trekking poles into the trunk of David's little Ford Fusion, and then stuffed myself into the back seat alongside our soon-to-be pacer Sammi Stoklosa and a mountain of clothes, food, and running accessories. Up front were David, our soon-to-be crew Cofer, and another (slightly smaller) mountain of running gear. Thus began our cozy two hour drive to Davenport Gap, which would be our starting line the next morning.

We checked into a little thru-hiker cabin a few minutes from the starting line and immediately set to work doing all of the essential pre-race preparations: eating pizza, drinking beer, sipping whiskey, drinking a little more beer, and fussing with our mountains of gear.

After a rock solid three hours of sleep, our alarms went off at 4:00am. With a planned 5:00am start time and a 15 minute drive, that was just enough time for me to visit the porta potty and wolf down the gourmet breakfast that I had picked up at a gas station on the drive down: a pack of strawberry Pop Tarts and a can of Starbucks cold brew coffee. Treat yo self!

**Miles 0-20: Sunrise and smooth sailing**
---

At precisely 5:01am (close enough!), we left Davenport Gap and began the long climb up to the 5,000'+ ridge where we would spend the rest of the day. David took the lead and, using trekking poles for the first time ever, charged forward at a solid pace. It was a lovely 59 degrees outside, but the humidity ensured that we were drenched in sweat within the first mile. The narrow trail was lined with fresh mountain laurel blooms and crisscrossed with even fresher spider webs, which David reluctantly deconstructed as he hiked.

A few miles in, the sun peaked out and we were treated to an orange sky over the blue haze of the mountains. Life was good!

Around the two hour mark, we passed our first of many (we thought) water sources of the day. David filtered a bottle, but I still had a liter and a half left and didn't bother to stop. If you were watching a movie about our adventure there would be an ominous organ chord played over this moment, but since that's not possible to do in a blog post I'll just inform you that we had, in fact, just passed the last available water for the next seven hours.

But that was for future David and Ryan to worry about. In the present, we were riding high on good weather, good views, and good company. As the trail climbed steadily higher, verdant rhododendron tunnels gave way to mossy old growth boreal forests.

We took dozens of pictures between the two of us but generally kept chugging forward at a steady pace, keeping our rough goal of 24 hours in the back of our minds. 24 hours is the finishing time that most runners shoot for on this route, and on paper it seems pretty easy. Just three miles an hour - barely a fast walk.

I don't remember where we were at this point in the journey, but I distinctly recall hearing David say ""that's not a good sign"" as he crouched over a dry creek bed. We had apparently reached one of the more ""reliable"" water sources in the first half of our journey and it was nothing more than a damp patch of dirt. As most of the Smokies are classified as temperate rainforest, it had not occurred to us that water sources could dry up during the spring, but in retrospect this might have been worth checking.

**Miles 20-40: How is a rainforest this dry?!**
---
It was now mid-morning and the sun was climbing in the sky. Traversing ridgeline at the same altitude as Boulder, CO, we had the benefit of cooler temperatures, but with 17% less oxygen in the air we noted that climbing uphill was noticeably harder than usual. Upon writing this paragraph, I also just remembered that running at altitude requires greater water intake than running at sea level. Live and learn.

After hours of rationing water, we were down to one last 500ml bottle between the two of us, and a couple hours of exposed ridge line still separated us from our loyal crew. David sent a text (hooray for cell reception on ridges!) letting them know that our situation was desperate and that we needed water asap. They responded that they could run out and meet us a few miles from the road crossing at Newfound Gap. With the promise of reinforcements on their way, we slowly sipped the last few milliliters of water and did our best to keep moving forward. We weren't going to die of dehydration, but if things got much worse we would have to make the difficult choice to drop out and protect our bodies.

As the water dried up, so too did our conversation, which to that point had been pretty lively. As ultrarunners are wont to do, we slipped into silent death march mode. Tried to conserved energy. Tried not to complain about how hot and uncomfortable we both were, as if acknowledging those facts would make them more real. It was just as well, since my tongue was glued to the roof of my mouth from dehydration. I vaguely remember offering to sell my soul in exchange for some cold water to splash on my salt encrusted face.

Somewhere around Charlies Bunion, Cofer came bounding into view with a handheld bottle. We gulped it down voraciously. A few minutes later David's friend Lea appeared with two more full bottles. Those were also gone in seconds. We thanked them profusely and then sent David ahead to get more. We would need at least a few more liters to properly unfuck ourselves.

A few minutes later, we arrived at Icewater Spring, which is aptly named. Good lord that water was cold and rejuvenating. We each chugged a bottle and then filled up several more for the road. I splashed a few handfuls of water in my face, the salt stinging my eyes as it ran off. I'm pretty sure I owe someone my soul now, and honestly it was worth it.

With renewed spirits and some great conversation from our pacers, we made quick work of the remaining miles to Newfound Gap. David and I staggered into the tourist-choked parking lot feeling much better, but still in need of some calories before continuing our run. The human body needs water to process food, so seven hours between water sources meant seven hours of insufficient calorie consumption. Sammi was waiting for us a the car with a buffet of food options.

""I got cold soggy noods!"" she said while gesturing to a Nalgene bottle of chilled ramen noodles.

""Yes, send noods!"" I responded. David similarly indulged.

Thus began a whirlwind 15 minute pit stop during which I may have eaten the biggest meal of my life. I inhaled the entire serving of noodles in two bites, unhinging my jaw like an anaconda eating a capybara made of pasta. I devoured two slices of cold pesto pizza left over from the night before. Cookies? Sure. Pickles? Why not? I chased this all down with a few big gulps from the Kentucky mule that I had prepared the night before. Cofer put a cold beer in my hand, and just as I took the first sip someone offered me a shot of whiskey. This was happy hour and a five course meal at NASCAR pit stop speed.

""Ready to go?"" said David, who was suddenly wearing a different outfit. Somehow he had found the time to change his clothes while I was eating my body weight in junk food.

""But..."" I said as I gestured widely at all the uneaten food that was still out, and then realized that 15 minutes had passed in the blink of an eye.

Beer still in hand, I waddled lazily after him and back into the woods. Much to the delight of my stomach, which indeed felt like I had just eaten a capybara, we immediately started to climb and I was able to digest the thousands of calories that I had just inflicted upon myself. The trail was rocky and frequently off camber in this section, but we were still relatively fresh after ""only"" 31 miles of running in ten hours.

After just two miles, we again saw our crew at a little parking lot in Indian Gap. I wasn't hungry, but I stuffed another cookie in my mouth for good measure. This stop was very brief, and from here we just had a ""quick"" 8 mile traverse to the summit of Clingman's Dome, where we would see our crew for the third and last time until the finish.

But as I would go on to learn about the Smokies, nothing is ever quick. Sure, there is no all-fours rock scrambling like the Catskills or the Adirondacks; there are no 1,000 foot per mile slogs like the San Juans; no knee deep river crossings. No, instead the SCAR is death by a thousand cuts. Each section is pretty rocky and pretty steep. And if, through a series of poor choices, you're pretty dehydrated to top it all off, you might find yourself suffering without really knowing what hit you.

All that is to say that the wheels started to fall off in the eight miles between Indian Gap and Clingman's Dome.

We weren't particularly sore or tired. We were no longer dehydrated or calorie depleted. But the trail was just rocky enough and we were just tired enough that we started to lose motivation.

We summitted Mount Collins, one of the numerous 6,000 footers on the route, and on my elevation profile it looked like we had a leisurely three mile traverse to gain the remaining 500 feet to the summit of Clingman's Dome. And from there, the trail went primarily downhill for the remainder of our journey. Despite our struggles, things were starting to look promising!

Then, much to my surprise, we started to descend.

The thing about relying on a low resolution elevation profile is that it smooths out a lot of little climbs and descents. So instead of our leisurely 500 foot climb in three miles, we instead had a 500 foot descent in the first mile followed by a 1,000 foot climb over the next two. Needless to say, that was bad for morale. Our crew texted asking how far out we were, and I responded that we were at ""mile thirty-fuck-point-fuck,"" which they thankfully thought was funny.

At long last, we summitted Clingman's Dome, where we spent another 15 minutes trying to put the shattered pieces of ourselves back together. As luck would have it, we ran into Hunter Leninger, who had just set the fastest known time on the 288 mile Benton McKaye Trail. This put our adorable little 70 mile adventure into perspective, and after a few minutes of self reflection we were back on the trail.

**Miles 40-60: Angry starfish and the giardia flavored water**
---

Fourteen hours had elapsed since we had started our journey. We now had 10 hours to cover the remaining 31 miles, which were primarily downhill. Despite our struggles earlier in the day, this seemed doable. Adding to our optimism was the company of Sammi, who would join us for the rest of the journey.

Our enthusiasm somewhat restored, we began our assault on the southern half of SCAR. Between Sammi the science teacher, David the nurse, and myself the research scientist, our conversation naturally drifted to extremely nerdy topics. Perfect! I can talk anyone's ear off about electrons and photons and the perils of grad school, and will gladly do so when the opportunity presents itself.

Despite the welcome distraction, I became increasingly aware of a sense of discomfort below the equator. The accumulated salt from 14 hours of sweat had resulted in a burning ring of fire, to borrow a phrase from Johnny Cash. I went to grab a lubricating wipe from my pack and realized with horror that I had used them up and hadn't restocked at our last supply point. This was going to be a long 31 miles.

With the boldness that only comes from many hours of running, I loudly informed my two companions that my butt was in the process of sanding itself apart. David confirmed that he was dealing with the same issue. Sammi, who teaches teenagers, was unperturbed by this news.

*Quick sidebar: Why the hell are the Jim Walmsleys of the world sponsored by running lubricant companies? You know for a fact that his skinny little thighs have never once touched each other during a run. Want to prove that your lube works? Sponsor a thick legged runner, you cowards!*

Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk.

We crested Siler's Bald just as the last few rays of sun disappeared from the sky. The narrow ridge was dotted with stunted trees and offered a nearly panoramic view. We were about to run through the darkness for the next nine hours. This is what ultrarunning was truly about!

As if on cue, the terrain grew rockier. Our pace slowed and the conversation became less enthusiastic. Sammi was using this run as mental preparation for her first 100 miler, and she was about to get a front row seat to a full fledged death march.

We reached Derrick Knob Shelter, where a very helpful Ridge Runner (Appalachian Trail steward) directed us down a steep side trail to a wonderfully cold flowing spring. Once David and Sammi had filtered their water, I sent them back up while I crafted a makeshift wet wipe from a paper towel and ice cold spring water, and attempted to do some damage control. My apologies to the confused woodland creatures watching this bizarre human bathing ritual. This offered a few minutes of relief, but I would be back in chafe city within a mile. Worth a try.

We trotted on through rolling terrain. Our elevation profile insisted that we were gradually descending, but it certainly didn't feel like it.

At some point in the middle of the night we heard a crashing sound just to the right of the trail. We had spooked some kind of large creature. Or at least it sounded large. Then again, a squirrel sounds large when you're running in the dark. The amount of bear scat on the trail was enough evidence that we should proceed with caution though. We yelled and sang loudly to scare off the animal, but as luck would have it, it kept running away in the direction we were traveling. A half dozen times over the course of a mile we heard the same crashing sound just out of sight. These are the times when you really appreciate running with other people.

With cooler temperatures, I was able to stay on top of my hydration and nutrition. My legs felt strong, and the altitude no longer seemed to affect me as much. However, there was nothing I could do about the horrific chafing that I was experiencing. I experimented with different running forms, even attempting a hands-on-buttcheeks approach which worked for a few steps at a time (and presumably looked really cool too). I would periodically fall back from David and Sammi while I attempted all of this and then hobble-run to try to catch up. I once again offered to sell my soul for a little bit of Vaseline.

""You still back there, Ryan?"" I would hear from David.

""Yeah, just working through some things,"" was my honest response.

About 15 miles from the finish, we reached our last spring. We decided to fill all of our water bottles since we anticipated these miles going rather slowly. As David lifted his water bladder out of his pack, a small container tumbled to his feet. Vaseline! David had forgotten it was in there. For the second time in 24 hours, I owed someone a soul. Thankfully I bought a 12-pack of souls the last time I was at Costco.

We slathered our naughty bits with reckless abandon, while Sammi politely turned away and pretended not to be entirely grossed out. Like I said, ultrarunning is disgusting. I make no apologies for that fact.

**Miles 60-71: The anticlimactic finish and aftermath**
---

Onward, and upward. Then downward. Then upward again (it was still rolling terrain). I vaguely remember summiting something called Devil's Tater Patch and being annoyed that there was not a single goddamn potato to be found. What kind of clownshow tater patches do you cultivate, North Carolina!?

The sun came up and the 24 hour mark came and went. No matter. We just wanted to get to the finish. Time was a meaningless human construct, and our human forms were just a vibrating mass of particles cooperating for an infinitesimal moment in the grand scale of the universe. Wow, did someone slip LSD into my water bottle or was the sleep deprivation really getting to me that much?

After way too many surprise invisible-on-the-elevation-profile climbs, we reached Shuckstack (or as I had been calling it in my head, Fuck Shit Stack). We climbed up to the fire tower and then just had a few downhill miles to the finish, and -

Wait a minute - where did the trail go?

We were standing at the base of the fire tower and there didn't seem to be any way forward. I pulled up my map and realized that we weren't supposed to climb up to the tower at all. Our only missed turn of the day, and it came four miles from the end. At least we didn't go very far.

Our self pity didn't last much longer, as we ran into Cofer and Lea just below the summit. They perked us up with stories while Cofer blasted classic rock from his phone. David asked Lea to run ahead and grab some drinks for us. A few minutes later she bounded back up the trail with a ginger ale in one hand and a beer in the other. David grabbed the ginger ale, which left me to suffer through an ice cold IPA. We all have to make sacrifices sometimes.

We reached the parking lot after 27 hours and 18 minutes of nearly continuous movement through the mountains. As I left the trail, Cofer informed me that I needed to touch the trail sign. I complied by heaving both trekking poles at it and flipping the double bird to the entire mountain range. Then I regained my composure and we posed for a nice finish line picture.

We flatly refused to run the extra mile across Fontana Dam, as some people choose to do, so our crew loaded our sweaty corpses into a car and shuttled us over to the bathrooms.

I took one of the most satisfying showers of my life, then spent a few minutes reflecting on the adventure with David. Or, I should say we attempted to reflect on the adventure, but we mostly sat slack jawed with thousand yard stares on our faces. I wondered aloud if it were possible to chafe a butthole completely off and whether I would need some kind of transplant. Ultrarunning is a silly sport.

I slept in the back of my Subaru for a few hours, then woke up at 3pm with an insatiable craving for breakfast food. As I was in the south, there was an easy solution: Waffle House! A short drive later, I was sitting in front of the most beautiful view of the entire weekend: Three sunny side eggs, triple hashbrowns smothered and covered, side of bacon. I ate every single bite.

Now with the benefit of four weeks of hindsight, I can say that I got everything I wanted out of this trip. I got to explore some new mountains for the first time since the pandemic shut everything down, I spent time with a good friend, I made a few new friends, and I scratched that long adventure itch that haunts all ultrarunners. Aside from a random Achilles twinge that has lingered around since then, my legs held up well and my nutrition plan (summarized as eating everything in sight) worked to perfection.

A week later, I received a small package from David. Inside was the coolest buckle I've ever gotten from a run, featuring a vintage map of the Smoky Mountains. I don't usually condone belt buckles for sub-100 mile runs, but this was so cool that I immediately made an exception. As I type this report, I am proudly wearing it.

This concludes my Smoky Mountains adventure. I have now done a handful of long runs in the South, and the mountains down there never disappoint. I can't wait to go back!

In the past I used Petzl NAO headlamp, but it is fairly heavy and doesn't last that long at brighter settings, and I wonder if there are any better alternatives?

I currently use Petzl Swift RL for occasional nighttime running. Overall, I really like the light, but the battery won't likely last for as long as I need. I consider getting a spare battery for Swift RL. I also consider getting an extra waist light like UltrAspire Lumen 400z. With Swift RL reactive lighting, its battery will likely last longer when combined with a waist light. I'll need about 12 hour burn time at moderate and, at times, high setting.

3 July I'm running my first race. Serpent trail race 100km.
The longest I've run so far was 50km in the beginning of May.

I'm trying to figure out what I can expect on the day to prepare mentally. 

About the race
http://www.serpenttrailrace.com/100k
1700 m total ascent. Most in the first half.
Mostly flat and easy terrain.
Male record around 9.5h.

About me
Life long runner. Got into ultras this year.
Weekly milage last month 45-55km.
Long run 30 km just under 3h (including red lights, mixing drink powder etc).
That's my ""I could do this all day pace"". But I'm pretty tired near the end so my actual all day pace is definitely longer.

Planned tactics
Start sloooow. Walk up all hills slowly pick up the pace throughout the race.


I'm guessing somewhere between 12-14h. But I really don't know. 
So long beards and wise ones.
What can I expect?",1624191100
Ultramarathon,Alec_Collado,Middle Distance--&gt;Ultra,"Hey guys, I'm completely new to ultra running, I'm currently 19 and I was predominantly an 800m runner throughout high-school (I ran 1:54, but I doubt it's really all to relevant to ultras). I intended to run in college but because of the pandemic, family troubles, and incompatibility with my collegiate coach I decided to drop my collegiate team and pursue ultra running after about 8 months of juggling injuries and very disappointing races. I've been running recreationally on an off for about a year since I quit. I had always considered running ultras after I was done with the track, and I finally committed to the idea.

I was raised in MIA and I have my heart set on the KEYS100 (hopefully in 2022). When I was in top shape I would comfortably hit 50-65 mile weeks including a lot of speed/sprint work. The longest I've ever gone was during my weekly long runs which topped out at 12-14 miles and the pace would be somewhere in the 6:20-7:30 per mile range depending on how tough my workouts were leading up.

I'm mainly focused on building up strength with lots of slower easy miles (mostly not looking at my watch and going on feel but they result around 8:00/ mile) and occasionally doing short easy strides focusing on form and running smoothly. I'm being very conservative with weekly mileage because I don't want to get hurt since I've been inconsistent until now but I've comfortably increased to 40mi after week 4 of consistent running hopefully I'll hit some 70+ mile weeks in the upcoming months.

Anyways I'd love some advice, tips, and resources because I'm kinda lost (it honestly almost feels like a different sport than the type of running I've always known.) I bought relentless forward progress but I'm waiting on its delivery. I'm also a big fan of youtubers/podcasts (e.g. Sage Canaday) so I'd love some recommendations so I can educate myself.

TLDR: I'm a former 800m runner who wants to run 100 miles and I'm giving myself ~1 year to build up to it. I have no idea what I'm doing. 

Am I stupid?

My question is sort of, how do you train for an ultra? Do you just go out and run, just longer distances? Does it depend on the race?

I assume hills are more important to train on for ultras, should I be pushing up the hills or is walk/jog up hills enough? What type of nutrition changes are necessary, and what type of nutrition changes are recommended?

**Pros:**

* If unsupported, no need for a tent or warm sleeping bag as the daytime will keep you warm.

* Stay warm on cold nights by running.

**Cons:**

* Few people like running through the night (especially multiple nights in a row).

Ultramarathon,samcrawford10,Race report: South Downs Way 100 (12th June 2021),"Result: Finished in 22:46 (new PB!)

**Background**

The South Downs Way 100 is a 100 mile race in the UK, organised by Centurion Running. It has 12,700ft of elevation gain, and runs between Winchester and Eastbourne in south east England. Most of the hills are fairly gentle and rolling, but there's a some long, steep climbs too.

I volunteered as an aid station worker at this race in 2019, which gave me free entry to the race for the following year. Of course, Covid happened, so the race was moved from June 2020 to November 2020. In October 2020 I picked up Covid myself, so I was doing my long training runs around the garden (which destroyed almost all the grass) whilst in isolation. Then a week before the November 2020 race, it was rescheduled again due to yet-another-lockdown. The new date was 12th June 2021.

So this race has been a long time in the making!

**Training and lead-up to the race**

Before the race, I had two successful 100 mile finishes under my belt (Autumn 100 and WSER) and two DNFs (North Downs Way 100 and The Bear 100). Autumn 100 was my best time at 25h 30m. Nutrition was always my weak spot. I can run a 19:50 5k, and 3h25m marathon, so should be able to go faster on a 100. My goal for this race was to make sub-24hr.

I didn't follow any kind of structured training plan (I know, I know...). I was doing 5-10k every weekday, and then a longer run at the weekends. I think my longest training run was 42km. I did a 50 mile race (80km) six weeks before the event. I used these longer runs as a way to test my nutrition plan. At peak, I was probably doing \~90km per week, but with very few hills.

On the nutrition: Historically, I think I've gone out too quick, then been fine through the first marathon, but haven't eating enough. Of course, then I bonk around 50 miles, try to eat, and either can't or throw up. Recognising this, I've been experimenting with some alternatives. What's worked for me in training has been to go slower out the gate, and carry \~5 slices of pizza with me. Then I'll eat a slice of pizza every 10k. This starts to suck by about 40km, but it's worked quite well so far. I've also found that I really hate Tailwind, gels, etc, so nowadays I stick to Lucosade and Sprite (alongside water of course).

Anyway, throughout April and May the UK was in an unusual cold spell. This would have been great for the race. However, at the beginning of June a heatwave kicked in, and it's been over 20C with bright sunshine every day since. The weather forecast for race day was 26C, no clouds, and no wind. Urgh!

**The race**

The race started between 4.30am and 6.00am, in a staggered fashion due to Covid. There were around 400 runners. I set off shortly after 5am.

The first 3.7 miles are an ascending set of loops around a private estate called Matterley Bowl (it literally is a bowl shaped depression in the ground). After that, you join the South Downs Way proper and stay on it for the next \~96 miles.

[And I'm off](https://preview.redd.it/r903g2idwm571.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d121cf314656355c3af084f9aef4694f3a85c82f)

The first 16km flew by, and was mostly gravel tracks and a few small country roads. At the first aid station I topped up water and went straight on my way. I was still eating pizza happily at this time.

At 34km in I hit the second aid station, which I skipped entirely because my crew was immediately after it. I was verrrrry lucky to have a crew on this race, and my frequent demands for 'more ice' would become a running joke later in the day. So far I was moving well though, eating ok, and drinking alright (although my crew was insistent I should drink more).

Until about 50km the course is a real mixture of open fields, covered forests, small single track, and wide open paths. The variety is very nice and the shade from the sun was a relief. After about 50km the story changes. At this point, the tree cover mostly disappears. Of course, this coincided with the midday sun arriving, so this is when things started to get tough.

[Looking sprightly about 40km in](https://preview.redd.it/qzk68ilmtm571.jpg?width=3872&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d166f2a371481f39e78c9df7f1171bb45e127a)

At about 50km, my stomach decided it had had enough pizza, but also didn't fancy anything else (uh oh). I think it was the heat that was driving this - it was now about 23C and rising. I was managing a couple of small bites of pasta at crewing points, a couple of strawberries and a few sips of iced Sprite. I also ditched the warm Lucosade and switched it out for flat, iced Sprite. My crew was also putting ice inside my hat, in my buff around my kneck (which I'd then eat), and filling my water bottles with it. The ice was a life saver.

I was still moving well between 50km and 80km - putting in around 6:00/km on the flats and downhills - but the eating situation was declining and I knew what this meant for later. I vividly remember being very annoyed at myself for the 80km-90km section taking almost two hours (even though there was a huge 5km long hill in there somewhere).

[As long as you like green rolling fields, the SDW is for you. This is a fairly typical view.](https://preview.redd.it/hrvmodctum571.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ea34217404c2c63b2c248b1109b89139488dba)

About 82km, I picked up my first pacer (hi Phil!) which was a nice boost. Phil could see I was struggling in the heat, so kept reminding me to watch my form (""head up, back straight, watch your footwork"") and to eat little and often. We were still moving well though, putting in 6:00-6:15/km, so I think the legs had plenty left in them.

Near the top of a long ascent around 90km, Phil said to me ""right, quick drink, 30 second walking break at the top of the hill and then we're running"". I remember feeling a wave of dread at his suggestion, and then almost immediately threw up everything I had in my stomach. It was a rainbow of strawberries, oranges and grapes. I immediately felt better afterwards (I always do), but knew this wasn't good news. I drank a few big gulps of water and then started having one small slice of orange every 1km. We carried on running and were moving okay still.

[The afternoon heat left me feeling \(and looking\) worse for wear](https://preview.redd.it/7rpg13ihum571.jpg?width=2176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e6847c7d4a648a9fcaed0452c7fe738e2c8224)

Finally, somewhere around 100km into the race the heat started to die down. At this point I'd been surviving on small bits of fruit, water and ice for about 60km. This had left me devoid of energy. Slowly but steadily I found I could eat a little more - a few nuts here and there, some more fruit, and some more sips of Sprite. I still wasn't feeling great though.

At 110km, my second pacer (Dan) picked me up and started working me hard. We were back to 6min/km on the flats for the next 5km, which left me feeling exhausted. Then he shared some grim news with me. I'd need to *average* 8min/km to come in just under 24 hours. Of course, this isn't quick normally, but you have to realise this was 110km into a race, it included any stops/breaks, and we still had a lot of hills to tackle (where the average pace was slowing to 11-12min/km). We'd also been warned that there were some 20min/km hills towards the end (which turned out to be FUD). This 8min/km pace sounded insurmountable and I started to protest, saying that 24 hours wasn't important, I just wanted to finish.

Nonetheless, Dan relentlessly pushed me on, insisting we run all the flats and downhills, and often had me running up gentle inclines too. Slowly but surely we were banking more miles. My eating was also starting to improve as the night set in properly, and I even asked Phil (who was now crewing) to get some takeaway chips (french fries for the Americans here) for me to try. I managed a bit of a pot noodle later on too. Eventually I ran the maths myself in my head and realised I needed about 10min/km, so either our pace had bought us some extra time, or my crew already knew this and they were feeding me false numbers.

[Looking pretty dejected at god-knows-what-time. But I loved those chips.](https://preview.redd.it/9z7vmiebum571.jpg?width=2176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651580ff090560c07f4e3e4a8875b712a9a64ca6)

The second half of the race seems to pack in a lot more really long, and quite steep hills. These really take it out of you and make you worry about timings (as naturally your pace dramatically slows going up them). Some stretches seemed to be 5-6km of constant uphill. Worse still, some of the descents were too steep for my sore quads to run down.

I remember the 140km point quite clearly. We had \~20km to go, and about 3 hours 50 minutes to do it in. I did the maths and worked this out to around 12min/km, so clearly we'd gained some more time. For some reason, I still thought this would be really tight time wise, so we kept pushing the pace. We were doing 7min/km on the flats and downhills, and 10-11min/km on the long uphills. We had been skipping all aid stations entirely since about 120km in, and were stopping only for a minute or two at crew stops.

Coming out of the Southease checkpoint, I was warned by other runners that there was a monumental climb that would slow us down to 20min/km. My pacer (Phil again) also told me it was the last *major* climb of the race. It was indeed a very long climb, but thankfully we kept it to around 11min/km. However, it was not the last big climb of the race...

At about 150km into the race it finally became clear to me that sub-24 hour was not only doable, but I would in fact be quite significantly under it. The last 10km of the race involved one last big hill (thanks Phil), and then a harrowing descent down a really rocky and narrow track back onto the roads for the final few km. That last descent would have been a nightmare had the race gone ahead in November - it would have been a mudslide.

I was feeling tired but quite smug as I ran the final few kilometres on the roads. My ankle hadn't flared up, I hadn't stubbed my toes (which when coupled with Hoka sized shoes often leads to missing nails), and hadn't tripped over at all. Of course, I then immediately tripped over an exposed tree branch and landed hard on my knee at mile 99. Classic.

Finally, we made it into the local sports ground for the victory lap around the race track. My crew joined me for this, and I even managed to up the pace to sub-4min/km around the track. I crossed the line in 22 hours 46 minutes and got my first sub-24 buckle.

[Finish line with my crew](https://preview.redd.it/3fyxzdzqtm571.jpg?width=3872&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d7d2054c3db4379ec2a265914e71d0a3a177264)

**Kit**

For shoes, I used the Hoka EVO Speedgoats. They were almost brand new, so still had plenty of cushion. This was really important on the hard sun-baked surfaces. Hoka's sizing continues to be a joke amongst my running friends, so I sized up a full 1.5 sizes. This worked out great for me - only one blister, and no nails being lost this time. Lots of other people were in road shoes, but the terrain was quite technical at times and I was carrying a niggling ankle injury, so didn't want to risk it.

For shorts, I used the Ronhill Marathon Twin shorts. The thigh lining on these have large elasticated pockets suitable for storing your phone, which is super handy.

For a backpack, I used the Salomon ADV-5, which is somehow still going strong after many years.

I wouldn't have changed anything about the kit - very happy with the choices here.

**Race organisation**

Centurion races are always very well organised. The course was very well marked and everyone was very helpful and friendly. If I had to quibble over something, it would be the aid station food/drink selection. I wasn't a fan of this even pre-Covid, and it's only gotten worse since then. There also wasn't any hot food on the course this year, due to restrictions on using kitchens due to - you guessed it - Covid. Thankfully there was a hot dog at the finish line, and it was glorious!

**Conclusion**

The South Downs Way 100 is a beautiful course. For anyone looking to do their first 100 miler in the UK, I'd definitely include it in your shortlist.

I was very happy with my performance too - I had imagined I *might* scrape in just under 24 hours if everything went perfectly. I'd already written it off before the race, owing to the hot weather. So to finish in 22:46 in those conditions was beyond my wildest expectations. Moreover, I think I could shave another 1-2 hours off that if my nutrition had gone better during the afternoon heat.

Last but not least, I'm \_extremely\_ grateful to my crew (Dan and Phil). I've crewed races too, so I know just how hard it is. I was very demanding - particularly for ice - and I am certain I would not have done nearly as well without them.

Ultramarathon,trail_unicorn,"Behind on training for first 100miler, advice?","I'm 12 weeks out from what would be my first 100 miler and wondering if I need to withdraw due to being behind on training? I'm just looking to finish and expect to walk a lot. Have completed a 50 miler and 55k plus a couple marathons over the last few years.

Training so far:
Been averaging 15-25 miles per week for the last 3 months with 2x 8-10 miles runs per week over the last month. Had planned to do more, but went through a big move/job change and have been dealing with intermittent knee pain. 10 miles feels pretty enjoyable right now.

Planned for the next 12 weeks:
Work up to 40-55 miles per week with some long backpacking trips (20-65 miles) in the next few weeks to help me ramp up while doing targeted knee/hip strengthening stuff. Planning on 4-5 long runs in July/Aug at 25-30 miles and one 45 miler 5 weeks prior to the race with a peak weekly mileage of 65 ish. Long Saturday runs will be followed by half that distance on Sunday.

Does this sound like enough to finish my first 100 (totally fine with being DFL haha) or do I need to bag it and look for a shorter race this fall? I have my nutrition/gear/mindset pretty dialed and have done some 24hr events for other sports. Or is it worth just showing up anyway and seeing what happens? 

Thanks!",1623783693
Ultramarathon,brdet,Heart rate and effort over time,"This past weekend I finished the Free State 40 mile in Kansas. It was a very technical and hot race with temps nearing 90 degrees. I've had a couple bad run ins with heat exhaustion in the past so my plan was to strictly limit my effort to a heart rate of 140 or less (I'm 38).

For the first 18 miles my HR averaged 135 and the effort felt slightly tough but comfortable. After that I began to slow down to a walk in most sections, and my HR dropped down to the 100-130 range.

Towards the end of that race, as the sun started to set and it cooled down, I could break into a slow run and my HR was still in the 120s but the effort felt more like being in the 140s-150s at the beginning of the race. 

I've noticed this before but this was the first time I really paid attention to it and I'm wondering if anyone can explain the physiology behind it. Do HR zones actually change over prolonged exertion?",1623757796
Ultramarathon,PsychologicalClock28,What to tell my support team.,"Hi all, 

I’m doing my first 100km next month. Can anyone help with timings and pacing?

My main goal is to finish, my secondary goal is to get a good time - but I haven’t decided what that “good time” is for me and my fitness. I want to give my support team a “this is the early/aim/latest time I could get to points” sheet. 

But how should I work it out? I don’t have a recent race to compare it to. Here are my stats: 

-29y/o woman, not injured. 
-I’ve been running for 18 months (at least regularly) but hiking/ cycling for a few years. I do slow, steady cycle tours with lots of bags on my bike that take most the day, but not as long as the 100k will take 
-I’ve done marathon+ distance 3 times, never in an organised race, next week is my final long run where I plan to do about 60km. 
-Last week I did 50km in about 7.5 hours.
-That was fatigued (I.e no tapering, a normal exercise week, and an hour strength training just before I left) and I felt ok the next day (i.e I did some gardening and/or a 2 hour hilly hike and felt ok - not top form but fine). So if I was doing a 50k race I think I would be faster.
-Almost all my training has been on similar terrain as the race

The McMillan running calculator gives me 18 hours for a 100km. Someone said I should times my 50k by 2.5 (18.25).

So I was thinking of telling my team that I will be aiming to do the first half in about 7.5 hours (I know you’re meant to go slower on a 100km than a 50, but I will be fresh and slightly fitter). Then the second half in between 9-11 hours. Is that reasonable?",1623756697

Ultramarathon,LJ50,Shoe advice for multiday desert ultra,"Hello all, I realise this is a fairly specific question but having searched for threads that might contain the advice I’m looking for, I’m still in need of input from anyone kind enough to offer it. 

I am doing the 5 day Ultra X Jordan event in October; this is 250km in the Wadi Rum desert. Can’t wait; got 80% of my kit sorted and dialled in and the training is going well. The one thing I am struggling with is shoes… so, pretty much the most important bit of kit. 

Is there anyone who has done this event, or similar, who can answer: Are trail shoes essential? Or will road shoes be fine? How durable and how cushioned do the shoes need to be for this kind of terrain and this distance?

I’ve done a few 50km and 60km events in the Hoka Challenger ATR 5’s and they’re….fine. Feel ok but feel clunky and unresponsive. Just underwhelming. I have the Inov8 Terraultra also and they’re fine too, nice wide fit and seem bulletproof. But, they’re zero drop and I suspect that’s a bit too severe for that distance. Same with the Altra Lone Peak. I find the firm sole of trail shoes more fatiguing than road shoes, which is fine on muddy trails or soft sand but I am a bit concerned about them on the firmer parts of the Wadi Rum.  

I love the Hoka Cliftons for long runs on the road and paths and I seem to get on with pretty much any Saucony shoe. I feel lighter, less fatigued and generally more natural in road shoes. 

TL;DR version: do I need a trail shoe or is a road shoe fine for the desert? Would the Clifton stand up to the battering of the desert or should I really just stick with the Challengers or another trail shoe and suck up the fact they’re a bit heavier and less comfortable?

Any advice very gratefully received (on shoes or anything Wadi Rum / desert related!)",1623570515

Ultramarathon,Altruistic-Clue-3647,From ultramarathon to marathon?,"Does anyone have experience temporarily transitioning from ultramarathons to marathons? And no... I am not talking about simply running a marathon, which comes pretty easily to most serious ultra runners. I am talking about going for a BQT or faster. Specifically, I don’t have a background running in high school but I got into trail running and then ultras in college (mid twenties now). I went pretty hard and fairly fast and fit, most notably on extremely vertical trails. For reasons that are not relevant to this post, I am now training for a marathon (hopefully 2:45). Training is going well, I am feeling good about my goal pace but this all feels pretty new to me. Going from running nearly 20 hours a week on vertical mountain trail to running 5-7 minute miles on flat ground puts me in a weird place where my weekly exercise time is cut in half with more miles, intensity has increased, hungrier, and I can no longer go out on marathon or 50k “fun runs” (which was common for me before)... anyways, just curious if anyone else has found themselves in a similar situation.

I’ve run several ultras including my first 100 miler in 2019. My races for 2020 were deferred like all of them to this year. I got very sick this year (not covid) and just started running again this month. My first 100m is the first weekend in Sept. the second is the first weekend in Oct. I’m pretty certain that even if I ran every day between now and then, the race in Sept would be foolish to attempt but I am really, REALLY wanting to run in Oct. It’s the HennepinHundred which is the race I ran in 2019 and I believe that I could do it. I know I can finish the course since I’ve done it before. So here’s the question. What would you do?

But I've the vague notion that I might try and be competitive if I'm not totally outclassed on the day.

I'm not currently overthinking my pacing (I tend to go by feel, and push towards the end) and I don't have the brain space for a conscious run/walk strategy. My plan is just to keep moving, and keep my lowest speed relatively high (fast power hike) and run as much as I'm able to.

Fuelling is pretty tried and tested but I'm planning to have different options in case it's hot and the usual stuff isn't doing it for me. I'm planning to take 500ml of water per lap on the course with me to save needing a vest, it's only a small event so I'm hoping queues for top ups will be minimal.

Ultramarathon,TheTimeIsNow5115,Question regarding training transition from 50k to 50 miler.,"I wanted to get some advice from some runners with more experience than me. I am 4 weeks out from my first 50 mile race. Last weekend I did a 50k race (my fourth 50k) as a training long run/gear and nutrition trial run. The race went well overall, tried not to push overly hard (finished 50th percentile). Nutrition went well. Had no major leg/joint/feet problems and felt pretty relaxed most of the 50k. However, the hills beat my quads up and it has taken 5 days for my legs to start feeling back to normal. In this time, I haven’t run but have been doing walking/hiking and doing body weight routines. Before the 50k, I had averaged 38 miles a week for the last 3 months with the longest week being 44 miles. I am going to start some short slower runs today/this weekend. Goal for the 50 miler is mostly just to finish.

For those who have had similar gaps between races, my big question is, what should the next 4 weeks look like before the 50 miler? Should I do a moderate week, then another peak weak before heading back into a taper? Just do several moderate weeks then a light taper? I am worried about losing fitness before the 50 miler, but also understand rest and recovery can be more beneficial than running myself into the ground and developing some sort of injury.

Ultramarathon,angelaslowpoke,Dark miles on 100km,"Hiya! So I’ve decided to take on my first 100km run in October. I think I could probably be ready before then but I’d rather increase mileage slowly, and wait til it starts to cool off a bit. I’m a bit slow on foot so will probably have some running in the dark to do. Would anyone who’s been in a similar position recommend doing this at the start or at the finish? 

My thoughts being: if I leave it til the end I might be a bit extra tired / clumsy in the dark? Or will the stress of running in the dark tire me out a bit more?

This is not an event, so I have the flexibility of front loading the dark miles or finishing in the dark. 

Over winter is obviously easy to train in the dark, and I’ll get as much running with a head torch in as possible beforehand, but would really like to hear any recommendations on where to focus my dark miles!

Longest I've ran is one marathon in Jan 2020. Did it in 5:40 without training and minimal running in 2019 due to a deployment. In Mar of this year I did the Havasu Lighthouse which is a half followed by a 5k after a small break. Half was done at 2:11 (10 min pace) then the 5k at 26 min (8:26 pace). So to keep true to my boneheaded fashion, I signed up for the 50 mile race without a true training plan. I run weekly and put in probably 14-20 each week. 

The race is a road run, 11 mi out and back twice with another 3 mi loop so nothing crazy with climbing or elevation. Is a 12 hour goal realistic? I live in AZ so can tolerate heat, but definitely a little concerned about that many hours pounding the pavement in the sun at 100+ deg. 

From reading here and watching coaching videos, gameplan is to replenish early and often with a gel and salt chews about every hour, water and possible electrolyte beverage in between aid stations, and stock 3 drop bags with pb and honey tortillas, extra gels, tylenol, some caffeine,  and first aid stuff.

Ultramarathon,SillySleuth,50 Miler next weekend. Am I good to run in the same pair of shoes the whole race?,"This race kind of snuck up on me! I’m running in my Hoka Speedgoat 4’s. 



I originally planned on getting another pair of the same shoe a few weeks before the race to break them in, but It kind of slipped my mind. 6 days out and I’m worried I’ll have a rough time in just one pair. This is my first 50 miler. My 50k I did last year I used just one pair but that was a road race. This is a trail race in Northern Virginia. About 5000 ft. of elevation gain on somewhat technical trails so using my road shoes is probably not an option. 



Any insight from people with more experience?",1623007475
Ultramarathon,Pie7ro,Ultrarunning - Watch questions,"Hello!

I have what i hope is a simple question. I am currently running with an iwatch but also looking into garmin or suunto watches. If anyone knows how to easily do the following on the iwatch or know if the Garmin or Suunto watches have an easy way to do this let me know.

When i am running a 50km I like to pace my first 5km at 7min 30sec pace and then next 5km at a 7min pace. After that I go to a 6:30 pace for a few kms with a pickup at a 6min km every now and then. 

The iwatch shows your current pace, rolling km and average pace. Is there a way to force the watch to show your average pace for a set time? For example 5km at my 7min 30sec pace then reset the average for the next segement of my run?",1622997254

Ultramarathon,CaptianKylo2024,Lack of progress in 50-mile training in regards to pace,"Hi, I am currently training for the Hanging Rock to Pilot 50 miler in October. The race will have around \~7,400 ft of climbing, and my goal is to do a 13-14 pace. I did a 50K in early May and did that in 7:18. I am by no means fast, and would not say I have much natural ability.

My question is, why have I not been progressing and getting faster in the past month and a half. This morning I did a 45-minute run, and I ended up at a 10:30 pace. The route was super flat. I was not going all out, but most of my running friends would do that at an 8 pace. I am currently doing 30-35 miles a week, plus a good amount of cross-training on the bike. For example, yesterday I did 5.5 miles, 20 minutes on the bike, then 15 minutes of strength.

I am a vegetarian and eat a pretty healthy diet, not a ton of food but I always make sure to get protein and carbs. I don't track what I eat, and don't deprive myself of much. 

Does anyone have any suggestions to increase my progress? If I need to just go harder on my runs, just tell me that. I know pace is not a big deal in the ultra world, in fact, I started doing this sport because I was so slow on the cross country 5K, but this is getting kind of frustrating.

Ultramarathon,-zinge-,"First 50k, lots of vert, how to taper and what's a normal amount of peak fatigue?","2 Questions for those that have done big vert ultras. I'm doing a solo 50k on a popular local route. It's a bit over 13,000' of elevation gain point to point with roughly the same loss. Questions in the title but feel free to read details below.

I get the basic idea of tapering, cut back \~20% per week each week, keep some intensity at lower volume, etc.  My first question is, do I keep the specificity during taper or can do I reduce the vert percentage?

Second question: I was doing a lot less vert for most of the training period, then really ramped it up the last 4 weeks for specificity and averaging 410ft/mile (78m/km) to mimic the route profile for the last 2 weeks. (I don't actually know what I'm doing, just kinda following some suggestions I read in books/sketchy internet sources). I'm starting to accumulate fatigue, which I suspect is from the vert, mileage hasn't really increased over the last few weeks, just vert. I'm at \~50mpw (80km/wk) right now. 

What should peak week feel like? Should I have heavy legs? Up until last week (before back to back longs last weekend), I was still progressing and putting down faster times at an easy effort level. This week has been especially hard and I've put down slower times. It's been unusually hot this week and I'm getting anxious due to the fatigue, is this normal for the peak weeks? I'm scheduled for back to back days at goal grade (20/15) this weekend before taper. Sorry I'm starting to ramble on here; maybe I just need a pep-talk.

Ultramarathon,bricks9317,My goal,"Hi all,

Small back ground: I used to be in good shape when in the army (British). By that I mean I could run 12-19km at around a 4:50-5:10 pace from the ages of 18-26 year's old. Along with being more than comfortable with any PT sessions and weighted tabs (basically walking fast with around 20kg)...nothing too special. 

I got out about 4 years ago, I'm 30 and let myself go a fair bit. I'm about 10-12kg overweight, stopped any proper routine fitness and kept eating and drinking shit. do the odd run here and there to stop me from becoming some sort of living blob

At the moment I'm running 10km in around 55 minutes and usually cracking 5k runs at around 5:45-55 pace. This is all max effort stuff though, like blowing out my arse wishing someone would end me as I'm spewing last night's Mr Kipling's. 

Basically I've had enough of my yoghurt body and want to give myself something big to train for as I feel it's the only way I can get disciplined and motivated. So Im going to sign myself up for a 100k ultra for June 2022. English South Downs to be precise. I've got a year to pull the finger out. 

I know people will tell me otherwise, but that's my goal and I'm not changing it. I'll drag my carcass accross the line with my eyelids if that's what it comes too. If I was to blow any smoke up my own arse, then I've got good mental conditioning which I definitely developed during my time in the military, and rely on that heavily during my runs at the moment and know it will be my best friend during an ultra. 

I should add that I've started a ketogenic diet. Is this something to ditch or keep? I've been at it for a couple weeks, weight has started to decline and feeling those typical benefits now too. I'd be interested if anyone has done ultras with that diet?

I've tried to be as accurate as possible when describing myself to give you lot some idea of my physical and mental fitness. 
Ultimately any advice from this group will be massively beneficial for me as I've never in my life ran more than 30km...
Diets, food, gear, plans and routines or just hearing your experiences. Any constructive criticism is more than welcome! 

Thanks all 🤘

Ultramarathon,jrkipling,How to train between races?,"I completed my first 50k 5/16. It was a tough course that took me a 30% longer to complete than I expected... legs were pretty sore the few days after but I was back to some light jogging 4 days post-race. Essentially, I did a reverse taper and last week I was back at my normal training volume of 50-55 mpw.

My next race is 6/12, a 6-hour race, and then I have an 8-hour race 8/14.

I’m curious if you have any advice to help me with this schedule. A few questions:
-Should I taper before the 6 hour in a couple weekends? I’ll have only reached my normal volume for a couple weeks before the race week. 
-Assuming I will need to take 2-4 days off or very light after the 6-hour race, should I again building back to my normal volume before the 8-hour in mid-August?

It seems like I should just be able to go to a training plan X weeks before my next race and do the plan until the event. Does that seem like a good idea? Is there one you recommend?

I am planning on running a marathon with 7k vert at 10.5k to 13.5k elevation.  I know this is a forum for ultras, but you likely have better training advice over folks trying to run super fast flat marathons.

My last ultra was 35 miles and I basically just slowly increased the distance.  Could I do the same thing for this, but also keep the elevation gains high?  I tend to avoid most of the junk mile short runs and keep it to two or three long high quality runs (I usually skip all the 3 to 5 mile shorty runs).

I appreciate your suggestions.  The race is the middle of September.  I also live at 10.5k, which should help.

I was able to phone the race organisers and self-extract. Nothing horrendous happened, basically it was quite a lot warmer than I have trained in,  and bad blisters happened so correct decision.

Without any background in running and having not been exercising for over a year I decided to train for an ultra.   

The David roche 100 mile training plan which is very flexible and free was of great value. 

In all, I ran about 500 miles over the course of the 12 week program.   My base was about 5-10 miles of leisurely weekly hiking. 

During the last 5 weeks my ankle was sprained 2x forcing myself to heal instead of training through the injury otherwise my training and race mileage could've been even better. 

I did 52 miles at a backyard ultra on the hottest day of the year so far.   I DNF myself when I believe I was still in pretty decent physical shape but met my goal and didn't want to risk anymore ankle damage in the night run.  

I had a great time training and competing in the event.  Looking forward to a few smaller races over the summer before another even more difficult ultra in October.

Ultramarathon,1newnotification,Intermittent Fasting &amp; Running?,"hey y'all. i browsed through this sub before posting, but the most recent post i could find regarding fasting and running was three years ago, and only had 10 replies. i'm hoping this sub has grown since then, and people can offer a little more insight. i'm posting this on an ultra page because i have a goal of doing a 100-miler two years from now, and you'd actually have to plan for fasting during an ultra, whereas fasting doesn't affect a 5k at all. 

i'm a 36 yo, 5'7"", 160 lb lady. i've been doing a 16:8, 7 days a week fasting schedule for the last 3 years as a lifestyle change. the main reason i do it is because i tend to stress eat, and so it helps me not dig into the midnight snacks. 

i've been training with a friend for a 15-mile trail race that we've got in two weeks. last weekend, i did a 9-mile fasted run and felt great. i wasn't hungry at all afterwards, but grabbed a breakfast burrito from a local cafe anyways because i figured i needed some kind of protein to recover well? 

i ran TWR of this week.. 5/6/5 miles respectively. i've gotten progressively more exhausted throughout the week: i napped on the couch for two hours last night, then moved to the bed and slept for another 7.5, 8 hrs. some of that could be due to the fact that i'm going to start my period soon, and am always more tired the week before. but i'm wondering if part of me being tired, too, is the fact that i don't eat anything after my runs? (i run from 6-730ish and don't eat until 11, generally.)

**do** any ultra runners actually fast? obviously i wouldn't try to do a 100-miler without eating anything, but i'm wondering if i'm going to have to stop fasting on a daily basis while training for a race? or, if you're a fasted runner, how do you determine when you need to break your fast and consume calories? because, again, i felt fantastic after last week's 9 miler.

I don’t wanna underestimate the distance, as I fully respect it and I get everyone is different but how many hours or miles a week should I be looking at averaging in training before taking on 100k? I don’t wanna be feeling too cocky after what could’ve just been a lucky day. I saw something about 6hours per week for 3 weeks of training for 50k/50 miles and 9 hours per week of training for 6 weeks for 100k/ 100 miles...

I don’t wanna be too stringent with it as I think my method for training for 50k seemed to work really well. My focus isn’t on finish time, just finishing and not hating it. Is it really as simple as doing more? Just continuing to build up weekly mileage? Getting some good long back to back runs in there?

How do you deal with an injury during your training period? Do you stop running completely until the pain goes away or do you run through the pain as long as it can be tolerated?

Ultramarathon,skrrtmemeboi,100k training,"I(M18) plan on doing a 100k trail race in October. I have run the course(its a circuit race) before and it’s not easy so will need to do some serious training. Overall elevation is 2500m(8200ft). Started running a year ago and ran one  65(41 mile) race a few months back and a few marathon or longer long runs. Currently running 50mpw base. I have a few months between graduation and enlisting in the army and in that time I can dedicate as much time as neede for training.Now, I have a few questions. First of all, this race is at night time(start 7PM), so I assume I need to do a lot of night runs right?
Also, I live in a flat part of my country and can’t really do hill training, how bad is that when training for a hilly race? Also, what weekly mileage should I shoot for when training for this kind of thing?",1621857677
Ultramarathon,Hocojerry,It's time for a change (of clothes),"

The majority of my running clothes 5-7 plus years old (or older). The majority of this shorts have turned into skirts and the shirt smell absolutely terrible.

I'm a very dedicated runner and usually run about 6 times a week so you can imagine over a 7 year period how bad some of these clothes smell at this point. My wife is basically begged me to get new stuff. My daughter pinches her nose as soon as I put my running clothes on. 

I was hoping for some suggestions on some decent quality but relatively inexpensive running clothes or If you know where I can get affordable Nike or Salomon stuff on the cheap let me know!

Ultramarathon,mattnotsosmall,Gaitors for sand/beach running,"Decided to sign up for a 100km here in Aus that has a significant (30-40km) on straight up beach running and the rest is fairly sandy trails. 

Coming from more of a bush running background I've never needed gaitors for anything other than snakebite protection in summer. Are there any particular brands/styles I should be looking at to minimize sand in my shoes? I've possibly heard of people gluing them on for desert races etc?

Have done a bit of beach work over the years but generally just barefoot up and down the beach. I'm thinking I'll run this event in hoka speedgoats with some gators and carry a spare pair of socks at all times so I can immediately clean up if I feel abrasion.

Will be training on similar terrain and the goal for this one is just to finish, but anything that steers me in the right direction/saves me trail and error will be considered. 

tldr: which styles of gators/shoes should I trial during training for a super sandy course. Any teccys or tips that may steer me in the right direction.

Is there any great way to train for elevation without elevation?

Every race that I'm seeing has a fair amount of climb AND I don't want to limit myself on races that are as flat as the earth (kidding); without a significant commute I'm stuck running with that &lt;100 feet of gain. So how can I train?

Stair steppers? Squats? Buying a treadmill and maxing it out on elevation?

Ultramarathon,alexmhamiv,Ultra Marathon in Weight Vest: Advice,"On June 6th, I'm going to be running a 50K in a 20lb weight vest, and my goal is to run a 50 mile ultra in a 20lb weight vest by the end of year. Need some feedback below, but first....

Let's get the main comment out of the way:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""That's terrible for you and extremely inadvisable."" Me: I understand, and I've been running for 2           years now in that dumb vest, and taking every precaution possible. Still, I get it...and I promise I won't force you to do it too.

Okay, now to the point: I haven't seen anyone do this before, and I would  love to hit two birds in one stone and do this for a good cause. Since I'm planning on running it anyway, and there are so many amazing non-profits (**I'm actually open to recommendations!**) out there, I keep thinking I'd love to raise some money...especially with everything that happened in the last year, and so many people who are going through hardships BUT:

I have a terrible gauge of what is impressive (I don't have a social group that I can lean on in this ultra-running world) and could garnish some actual fundraising via attention/publicity. I keep thinking about people rucking with 40-60 lbs for X amount of miles. Point is: I don't want to get a non-profit involved for a fundraising event where nothing happens and we all look silly.

I  just need some advice to ensure I don't make a great organization trying to do some good look stupid. I can just imagine some reporter  saying: ""Wow,  here comes the legend, running down the final stretch  finishing an whopping 5K, how did they do it?!"" --I'm exaggerating of  course, but you  get the point.

I have no problem looking like an idiot myself...I mean....I'm running  ultra's in a weight  vest...I'm not that bright, but don't want to rope in anyone else unless this self-challenge I'm doing has some weight to it (pun intended).",1621534671

I decided on it because it's close to home and primarily on a trail I've hiked before. But they'll be adding about 8k onto the course using adjoining trails to bring it up to 50k, and so far, there's no course map or info on the additions, so no final elevation total or profile. More importantly, there's no detail yet on the number and spacing of aid stations, or what they'll have on offer. I've contacted the RD, but no reply so far, even with an ETA.

As of now, my plan is to start mixing in a vest along with my current handheld/belt set-up in case there's a large gap between aid stations. But I'd welcome any advice on how to dial in a plan with these unknowns and what you'd come prepared for if some of these questions remain in the dark as race day draws closer.",1621443007
Ultramarathon,JPNAUS,50k on my 50th!! What an awesome journey,"The Hardest Best thing I've done by far, super stoked to have finished, last 6.5km thoughts of not finishing took over, hamstring cramps, stiffness, pain, and more pain, but step by step I kept pushing. My goal was within 7hrs, finished in 7:05.

Thanks to everyone that posts on this forum, your tips, advice, stories have all inspired me to push through with my goal of completing my 1st Ultra.

I’ve enjoyed everyone’s breakdown of their journey, so here is mine, I hope I don’t bore you to death. For those that are 1st timers like me, at the bottom I have put some tips, ideas that might help, pretty much a mix of what everyone says here.

**50k on 50th the journey begins**

I had planned to kick off at 5am, so I could walk at least an hour before sunrise, final night nutrition preparation and final check list took longer than planned, so made the decision to sleep same amount of time, I thought I would need the energy!! Little did I know what was to come. Nerves had definitely kicked in for the last week or so in the build-up, and I guess the night before the stuffing around was more nerves than anything. I don’t think I slept well that night, but was awake in the morning before the alarm at 4:30.

I had read about breakfast tips, so went with a big bowl of white rice, with a sprinkle of pepper for flavouring and a strong coffee, did the trick to lighten my load before the start.

Temp for the day was from 12-23 degrees Celsius, but with a westerly wind off the land the chill factor made it feel cooler, sorry, South East Queensland in Australia doesn’t really have cold weather as such, but you get used to the conditions, so felt cold enough. 

I had worked out my route so the car was roughly in the middle, distance from end to end roughly 14.5km, this made it great for only carrying what I needed (a bum bag at the front for my phone and snacks, and a bottle holder on my back), so every 50min or so I could top up drink and food. My challenge today was to finish to crack the 50 on my 50th, otherwise I might have tried a point-to-point walk, but the waterfront where I trained, just seemed perfect, had 3 toilets along the way, so all bases were covered.

**5:50 and I was off and feeling fantastic!**

I was persuasive enough to get my 20 year old daughter to start journey with me, she was hopeless, here I’m thinking we’ll have a nice chat for an hour about life, etc, she was either 20-30m behind, kinda trying to jog beside me, or 10m in front, and was telling me to shut up to conserve energy, I think she was the one struggling (she’s super fit, but my speed was just an awkward pace for her), but was still special to share that with her, and got some nice snaps of the sunrise together. I was having the time of my life, so decided to do video snaps every hr as a condition update.

15k in and feeling great, other than the 4 toilet stops, body was good, although I had started to feel numbness in my right foot toes from around the 3km mark, I put it down to the cold morning, but it just stayed the same all the way through until the finish.

21.1k, ½ marathon done, I had done two of these in the past, both around 2:40-50 mark, today my pace was 2:57 including my break, so feeling good.

From here on I was in new territory, how would the body handle another 29k! 

**Injuries from Sep 2020:** 

Sep. Lower Back, torn tendon - horizontal for a few days. 

Mid Dec. Plantar Fascia – from excessive walking, bad foot motion. 

End Dec. Shin splints top of foot – excessive walking, weak calves. 

Late March – Grade 1 tear – hamstring – thinking I could jog.

Mid Apr – again tear of hamstring – yep trying to job again to fast too early. 

Late Apr – due to stiff hamstring, I inflamed my tendons under my knee where the hamstring joins back onto the shinbone

So you could say I had a challenge ahead of me, great work by my physio and rehab work got me to the start line.

&amp;#x200B;

Up to 30k mark was mentally good, body was staring to show signs of tiredness, 30k was my last sub 8m km and 1st since the 22km mark. 

34k and 38k toilet breaks, was like, man, how do you stretch while your letting go a load, the stoppages were definitely making my legs feel stiff and sore. 

Just after the 34k toilet break my 1st support member arrived, he was thinking he would just start walking with me, no worries, I instantly left him behind, and I could hear him singing out, ""I can’t keep up!"" I think having him arrived I was lifted, as look at the watch and 7:40m/km speed, didn’t last long, but he walked for about 500m behind me, then warmed up so he could jog to catch up. He also tried to jog beside me, but was doing it tough, and would fall back, then jog again to catch up, or when I went out to a jetty and back, he would stop for a pitstop.

38.5k 2nd support showed up, she was smarter and brought her foot scooter so she could ride beside me. Within the next km, my daughter had brought down her pushbike so my 1st support crew could ride the bike, I think he was relieved.

From here on I was really starting to feel the pain in my legs, the right calf was getting tight, left leg was numbing, and toes on right foot, yep, they were still numb too. Hip joints also starting to slowly ache. To my amazement though the injury just under my left knee that I thought when it happened was going to be my biggest concern, and I even wondered at the time  ""Would I be able to walk"" was numb, but less than 2, so that gave me confidence.

Words of encouragement definitely helped give me a boost. I was on the last leg and started thinking of the finish line!

Hydration was becoming an issue on my way back to base, so support member road ahead a km to grab me a drink, you would have thought riding a bike he would get there and back, but we ended up catching him while he was still at the car. Grabbed sweet potato and banana, new drink and off again.

42.1k came around, and yep here I am thinking I’ve completed a Marathon 5:53:44, brain obviously wasn’t thinking, added the extra 31sec that would take me to do the next 100m, if I kept this pace to the finish would break the 7hrs, little did I know what was about to hit me.

43.5k all of a sudden after a rise in the path, left hamstring cramped up, crap, stretched it out, my brain was telling me how stupid I was that I had backed off my hydration, and now I was suffering. Support crew offered words of encouragement, telling me to take my time, but my brain was saying stop too long and the rest would cramp up too, so ever so slowly walked it out, very slowly and built back up my speed. No way was I going to get this far to not finish. 

45k again on and incline my left hamstring cramped up, not as bad, but the body didn’t want to go up any rises, stretched this one out easier than the last, and again slowly took off, now I had to descend, and the legs were feeling it. Down to my turn around point, I was on the home stretch, well still just under 5k to go. I still needed one last toilet break, and my body just hated to stop, made it, level ground and I was off. Back to the car, one last 1km round trip to the break wall and I would be done, well my measurements were out, and need a further 250m so walked around the park. By this time, virtually no real feeling in my legs, just pain and more pain, somehow they just kept putting one foot in front of the other.

Before I could stop at the 50k mark, I had used my Apple watch Fitness app - Outdoor Walk to measure my trip, but I had also used my NRC app as I had used this on all my previous walks. Only problem was it was showing a 600m discrepancy to the Apple Fitness app, I knew Apple’s App would be accurate as it had been active the whole time, but wanted to have the NRC show the 50k, so end up with two finishes. That meant a further 600m, but the finish line was in sight and I just walked it out.

&amp;#x200B;

50k!! I had done it, and didn’t the body tell me, I struggled to change clothes and lie down to do some stretching.

The contrast between upper and lower body was chalk and cheese. As I laid down to stretch my legs, I pumped out 3-4 push ups just for the fun of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recovery**:

Got home after having lunch with my colleagues, I just sipped water. I couldn’t walk to my car to drive, so they had to pick me up and drop me the car. And my legs were starting to cramp up.

Body was so so sore, I could hardly get in and out of the car, and struggled to hobble up the stairs once I got home.

My family bought some ice and Epson salts, crap that was cold, only lasted 20sec, shivering like crazy, dried off, added hot water, take 2, still too bloody cold, lasted about 30sec, more hot water, okay, cold, but could handle it, well 2-3 mins anyway. One bag of ice would have been ample, two was way overkill.

No way was I able to put pants on, lifting my legs wasn’t going to happen, my wife had to assist.

I then lied down on the couch, elevated my legs and virtually zoned out for next 4hrs.

My other daughter arrived home and we celebrated my birthday, they did an awesome job with balloons and streamers in the house, couldn't have been happier.

Never thought going to the toilet was so hard, that sitting down motion, my legs were rebelling. 

My girls said I look like I’m 90, hardly able to stand up straight and walk, I was hunched over and tiny steps.

Going to bed, couldn’t move my legs, and the pain was everywhere, there was just a constant ache, but was bearable enough I didn’t take pain killers, somehow I went to sleep.

Next morning, getting out of bed, was a struggle, and still super sore. I walked it off a bit and got better the more I walked, going downstairs was a killer. 

Stood most of the morning and tried to work, I have a stand up desk, so was feeling fine, but by early afternoon, the legs need me to lie down.

Physio booked for 5:30pm, did a 15min slow stroll before I left to get some blood flowing, took something to chew on, it was going to hurt!

I’m sure physios enjoy inflicting pain, butt releases were the worst. He’s bloody good, and I knew this would be for the best.

Even with all this pain at the end and recover crap, already thinking of getting back into training, need to seriously work on my calves and leg flexibility, I’ve got 2 years to run my 1st Marathon, the challenge begins!

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did I choose to do an Ultra and on my 50th?**

My journey started last October when finally, after years of waiting I bought an Apple Watch, it really motivated me to work on my fitness, and to honest, I had done virtually nothing since 2010, work got in the way, or was my way of making excuses for not exercising, so the watch was the true start of my journey to get back into fitness, a back injury 2ndtime in 2 years back in Sep was also motivation. I knew my 50th was just around the corner and was thinking what I could do that would be something to remember. At first 5k walk popped into my head, that was lame, being 50 means doing 50 of something. Okay let's try for 50 pushups, chin-ups, sit ups, etc. at this point 10 pushups was a struggle and well chin-ups 5-6 half ones and I was done! So with the Apple watch on my wrist, I started walking late Oct and it came to me, let’s walk 50k on my 50th!

**Training**:

Oct – 34k

Nov – 200k

Dec – 188k

Jan – 52k – Started to cross fit exercise to keep my cardio fitness while recovering injury

Feb – 116k

Mar – 108k

Apr – 111k

May – 37k – 1 x 7k walk 5 days out, 1 x 7k 13 days out, other were less than 4k slow walks

&amp;#x200B;

**Walked with Apple watch series 6** – Start 100% finished on 30%, turned off everything all back ground refresh stuff except what was needed. My iPhone I took videos along the way, and I knew if wouldn’t last, so once it got down to 70% I had a portable charger that I carried and got it back up over 95%. I also had my watch cable should I need it, I had tried on a walk and GPS still worked, just no heart rate monitor, but it would charge okay.

&amp;#x200B;

**For 1st timers things to do**: 

Make sure you’re legs are conditioned, my physio was awesome to help through my injuries and set goals to allow me to keep on track. I was only walking though not jogging.

Finger socks! They were great, I actually wore another pair over the top, and only ended up with minor blister on one toe. Thanks to this forum, this was best tip of all.

I wore sports pants, but still put Vaseline in areas of concern, no issues.

I tried face / neck protector for the sun, here in QLD you get burnt very easy, plus sunscreen, I still got burnt on my face, so be sure to apply more than once.

I ended up with sore nipples from my sport shirt rubbing them, felt like a rash during the walk, so would definitely recommend covering, I guess depends maybe on shirt you wear. 

Having a support crew, two work colleagues for last 10-12k was awesome, really gave me a lift and helped me to push through the last 7km and helped talk me through my cramps.

Nutrition – lollies, thanks to the person that mentioned liquorice! Boiled sweet potato, banana, rice crackers and sport energy gels. The gels I aimed to take every hour, solid foot every ½ hr in between. Rice crackers, not sure I would use them again, sweet potato and banana was great. I had no gastro issues during or after, just in last 24hrs more gas than usual.

I made up 600ml water bottles with Electrolytes + energy (my build up 4-5 days out drinking water, there was no way I was doing to dehydrate, I had made 4 toilet stops within 1st 15k, I had to stop drinking, these constant breaks were time wasters! 8 breaks in total)

I also had plan water bottles and too many that I though I would need.

Ultramarathon,Capt_Darling8,Solution to cramping in Ultras....,"I dnfd my latest ultra, and looked back at my training log, and also previous races and came across the same issue. 

Bottom line is I sweat terribly, and lose a lot of sodium - white powdery marks on skin and kit....

I thought I had it sussed at my last race, but not quite. I used zero electrolyte drinks and tailwind, but still cramped horrendously from mile 16 (I finished 33 miles of the 42).  However, by this point my cramps in my calves and hamstring were almost tearing the muscle and I couldn't move with serious cramping pain.

Question I have is does anyone else suffer quite so much, and have they tried Precision Hydration products? If so, can they share results? I've ordered some 2000ph based on a few emails and wonder if any one else has some experience to share with pre and during race strategies...

Ultramarathon,notexactly_butclose,"Running my first 100 miler in June, any last minute advice?","Hi All,

Been a long time lurker of this sub. Got bit by the ultra bug after my fourth marathon. Right before COVID I did a 50 mile on sub optimal training in the dead of winter in upstate NY (11 hours). For the last 3.5/4 months or so been working up to 50-70 miles a week fairly consistently. The 100 I will be running is the Lighthouse 100 in Michigan so will be relatively flat and on paved road.

I’m a bigger/thicker guy in the standards of people, and definitely in the ultra community. Hasn’t really held me back because most of the extra weight I carry is muscle - but it will be interesting to see how my 5’9” 190ish frame holds up on 100 miles. 

I’m running crewed and with 3 friends, all semi-experienced marathon/ultra runners. Was curious if you all have any last minute advice. Body has felt pretty decent and no real lingering issues aside from runner gut post runs.

Would love to hear what you all have to say! If of interest, happy to write a race recap after.",1621358598
Ultramarathon,mhinimal,losing weight,"I am planning a 50k in Early September (16 wks out). Spent the last several months just working on building my base coming back from a lay-off, and focusing on staying injury free while training, and now I am just cracking into about 35-50 miles per week, and my plan is to try and maintain that mileage and start building up the long run. Presently working up back-to-back long runs on the order of 14+10.

Anyways I want to lose some weight and am finding it really difficult. Just my appetite is insane, I run more and i just get hungrier and end up eating a bunch of calorie dense stuff I don't intend to. If I simply ""don't buy"" the calorie dense stuff, I eat other stuff. Or eventually I crack after a week and on my next grocery run and get something. Whether it's peanut butter, a block of cheese, an entire thing of hummus and pitas. If I buy none of those things and no snacks I feel very deprived all week. But if I have them in my house at all I can't seem to moderate and just eat a whole thing in one sitting. I have noticed they are all high fat foods. I thought my diet had enough fat in it already but maybe not?

Generally eat pretty healthy, well balanced meals, lots of fiber. Lots of vegetables, rice/quinoa/potatoes, eggs, chicken and beef (usually fatty cuts, thighs with skin or decently marbled steak). Smoothies for breakfast incorporating spinach, yogurt, whey, berries, nuts, almond milk. Dinner is usually stir fry or something similar, grain+protein+vegetables stir fried in coconut oil

My weight is maintaining so at least I'm not going THAT overboard. But I'm about 15lbs overweight (~178 right now and when I'm lean I'm ~162ish).

I dunno I probably just need some hard truths spat at me. I know I just have to eat less, it's simple, it just feels discouraging. Have tried on multiple occasions to reduce intake for a week or not buy certain problem foods and I can keep it together for a week or two but i keep breaking and buying them again.

would appreciate some advice or just your personal experience trying to sustainably lose weight while running a bunch. In the past I have dieted ""successfully"" while training hard but inevitably went too extreme, and wound up overtrained (or under-recovered) and burnt out. Trying to approach this sustainably so i don't burn out this time. I don't even have to lose all 15lbs, if I could just get a strategy that gets me down 5lbs and keeps me there I'd consider that a win.",1621297137
Ultramarathon,ajsherlock,Advice: Fine tune my last few weeks of training,"It doesn't matter terribly, but I just realized a marathon that I'm using for a training run is actually on Sunday, and not on Saturday (what I was thinking, and the day I typically do my long run). It is however on the weekend of memorial day. My original plan was 26 (trail race) on Saturday, 10 on Sunday, easy couple on monday... but if I have the 26 on Sunday, should i run 10 on Saturday and easy shakeout monday, or still do the 26+10 as planned but on Sunday and then Monday. If you followed all that, congrats! I think i'm hung up on the ""run a second long run the day after a long run"" I guess it still works the same way if I run the shorter one first instead of second?

The trail marathon is my last long, long run before my A race - a 50k on June 19. So, i'll run 18 the week after (no doubles), and then 10 the week after that, and then I'm at the 50K. If it helps here's the plan as i have it:

Ultramarathon,MrDilkington1,I need to estimate calories spent by running so I can track of I'm still in a 200 calorie surplus for lifting. Please help.,"I'm 58kg and 5ft5. Yes, I know that ultra running and gaining muscle are polar opposite gains, but it is quite clear to me that if I'm in a surplus then I will gain muscle, just not optimally.

So I need to know how many calories I burn per mile. I'm usually running between 4 and 5mph which is something like a 7:30 min per km.

I used to estimate 100 cals per mile, but I think this is overestimated.

Would 80 cals per mile be reasonable?

Ultramarathon,Baz_99,Ran my first trail event - UTA50 50KM 2450m+,"Tldr: I ran a 50km, it was harder than I expected.

I thought I'd share my first trail race...

Training
I did about 75km/wk average for 12weeks leading up to tapering (one week). And say 50km weeks for three months before that.

I also ran a self supported 50km with 1500m of elevation with the view of learning as much as I could. It took 6.5hrs incl some stops to take in some views. 

Race week
Tapering really sucked, the most rest days I had since January was 2 days before I ran my trial 50km. 

The say before once I got to event, was fun but also daunting seeing the race setting for the first time. 

Race day
It was cold by Aussie conditions. I was in the last start group, and rightly so having no prev race experience. 

First 6kms were a bit of a sorting stretch on an out and back road run that take you to ""the giant stair case"" which is essentially a single lane stairwell that was so congested it took 30 minutes to get down. Then there is only stairs up and down for the next 19km except for maybe a 1.5km stretch of road running through a water point. 

After all those stairs there is a pretty technical single track to the 28km checkpoint. 

After this, it's downhill running for 8kms, my quads felt like they were going to explode. I never did enough downhill running training. 

I got passed by plenty making my way down to the floor of the valley and then another climb and then another descent to the 42km mark for another waterpoint. 

Now only 8km left of climbing which is where I definitely felt more comfortable. I used a single trekking pole(which I got from Kmart for $8 which I have done about 500kms of running with so far) and clawed my way back past a lot of ppl whole had got me on the downhill. 

The last section is called furber steps, it is 951 stairs to the finish. It is pretty tough going, but not too different to the other 5100 stairs on the course.

The finishing chute - wow, it was really overwhelming, I was pretty thin emotionally at that point and I was basically brain dead trying to do the mandatory gear check.

Day after
I am in so much pain. It hurt more than I thought it would.

Takeaways
Run downhills as much as you run uphills. 
I did so much stair training and hill running that I did a lot better going up than going down. 

Nutrition
I blasted through the checkpoints and relied on my own gels and bars. I did get some water and electrolyte refills at 28km and the 41.5km water point. 

My expectations vs reality
I wanted to do it in 7hrs - I ran it in 7:52. 
It was way harder than I expected, weather conditions, the amount of ppl and my downhill running condtion.",1621243465

Ultramarathon,Commercial-Tough-406,On overtraining,"I’ve been running with Ultrarunners for about three years. In that time I’ve seen all sorts of people get injured, flame out, or get some weird undiagnosable stomach/back/nerve problem that permanently sidelines the. The common underlying theme with these runners is a kind of whiplash to their situation, they don’t understand how they got there, what’s happening, or how to get out.

My contention, almost all of these runners are suffering from overtraining syndrome, or OTS. At its simplest OTS is the result of too much training with not enough recovery. It can take months or years to manifest, and it’s effects can last even longer. 

Some examples 

1. A runner who had been casually doing ultras for several years got fast and started racing more often, around an ultra a month. Had a phenomenal year then flamed out, still has not recovered 2 years later

2. A runner completed the triple crown, took a few months off, and was beset by injuries/chronic fatigue every time they tried to get back into training for several years

3. An underweight runner who had been running well for decades completed their first hundred miler. For about 3 years afterwards they were beset by bone and stomach issues which doctors had tons of issues diagnosing 

4. A young runner with limited running background got interested in Ultras. Rapidly ramped up with lots of miles at high HR, completed several races, and was slammed with several injuries at once. Has not returned to running after several years.

In all of these stories there are a few underlying themes. All of these runners pushed themselves past their limits for several months or years. They all had a diverse range of issues, with the most common being overuse injuries. And all of them took years to recover.

OTS sneaks up on you because it’s all about accumulated fatigue. You can’t just think about what you’ve been doing in the last week or month, OTS can build up over years. Ultrarunners are especially susceptible to it. The culture rewards running lots of big days, lots of miles, lots of races. People don’t have the experience to slow down and say “I’m pushing hard every week, I should back off”. So they have a great year or even a great couple of years until the fatigue catches up with them.

Take a look at your own local scene, or even Elite Ultra runners. The sport is replete with folks who burned hard for a few years then dropped out entirely. This isn’t a sustainable pattern, and your own training should be built around respect for the stress training imparts on your body.",1621182544

That means your ability/discipline is depends on an external factor which kinda means you didn't do it on your own.

Thennnn you could go as far as saying music is cheating too. It gives you something you couldn't create on your own in that moment, which helps you.

Ultramarathon,EuroLusken,A rule of thump for elevation gain and own abilities?,"Hi all

This might end up being a hypothetical discussion. Nonetheless, I thought it could be interesting to get your inputs on the matter.

Do you have a rule of thump regarding what you deem possible regarding elevation in a race? 
For me, I have a quite good feeling about what's possible in relation to distance, but find it much more tricky when it comes to elevation gain (EG). 

I have been thinking a lot about it as a I have a 70km race in 1 month with 4.800m (15.748f) of elevation gain. And I don't know if I can do it. The distance is alright, but I have never encountered that much ascent in one take. For reference in this particular case, I ran a 55km race with 900m EG 10. April and a 60km race with 1.450m EG 1. May. I feel it would be risky to go out and do a test with 2.500 EG at this point.

So, do you guys have a ""if you can do x, you can also do y""-kinda rule when it comes to elevation?

Thanks!",1620980519
Ultramarathon,squeakycleaned,How to salvage my taper for a 50K?,"I’ll be running a trail 50k with 5500ft of elevation on May 29th, and I think I may be undercooking myself. 

2 weeks ago I did a 46mi week with a 20mi trail run with 3700ft as my long run. Last week I started my taper gently with a 40mi week, where the long run was 20mi of fairly flat roads.

My concern is that I started too early, and that last week should’ve been my hardest week, so now I’m considering going harder this week afterall. (Mid 40’s and a 20mi trail.) That would leave me with a two week taper. 

Does this seem like a good move to more experienced runners, or should I just stay with my original plan and continue to ease up this week?",1620950857
Ultramarathon,MrDilkington1,Hey. Can someone guide me to the times for a 100 miler?,"Someone once laid out finish times for a 5k in a similar way. Like:

35+ minutes beginner
30 mins probably got some experience
25 mins, experienced in running for some time
20 mins, there's been some dedicated training, some consider advanced
Sub 20 is advanced 

I'm struggling as to whether I should aim for a 30 hour or 24 hour cut off. I managed to finish a 50k in 7 hours, and a 50 miler in 12:30 hours (but I fudged the timing of my walk breaks, I could have made 12). 

Though my training since my 50 was interrupted by mild injury, I'd say before my 100 I will have a good 20 weeks of 40-50 mile weeks.

Which should I go for, the 24 or the 30? Something is telling me the 24hr to a 100 is what 30 mins is to 5k in terms of ability level, if you get me?

Curious to hear which watches you all are using during 100 Mile ultra's and why you ended up with that choice in the end.  
I'm also wondering if anyone who has run a 100 Mile while wearing a Garmin Forerunner 945 could provide me with some wisdom. Were you able to have HR, GPS, Bluetooth, and utilize Pacing Data over a 24hour+ period without the watch running out of battery (without recharging during rests at aid stations).  


I'm looking to upgrade my watch from an old Fitbit that I had. I think I prefer the sleeker model of the 945 over the Fenix. As well as being able to use features like Virtual Partner. Going to keep an eye out to see if the 955 has larger battery life as well.  


I also like the idea of being able to store music &amp; credit card on my watch, so I wouldn't have to bring my phone with me on shorter runs.

Ultramarathon,peco9,My first 50 Km and what I learned," *I just ran  my first marathon on saturday. I love reading race reports so I figured I  should give back to the community.* 

What better way to celebrate your birthday than setting new personal records?

I've always been interested in ultrarunning. I don't have an answer for why I didn't get started earlier. But I am finally doing it. After almost three months of training with ultras in mind I figured trying a 50km run would be fun. Plus, I did sign up for a 100km race in July. I better learn some lessons while there’s still time to adapt my training

I texted a friend: Thinking of running 50 km on my birthday next week. Wanna join?

He immediately answered: “No. But I'll join for 25km. Tell me when and where. I'll be there”.

No follow up questions, no conditions. That's a real friend right there. We decided he’d run the second half with me. Perfect. Someone fresh to get me going when I’m tired.

**The goal was not to do well.**

It was to learn what works for me. What should I eat and how often? What gear do I like? What pace should I run etc. I wanted to come back from the run knowing what I need to do between now and my race. And boy did I learn.

**The route**

Living in central London means finding interesting places to run isn't always easy. I decided on a path that would take me through Holland park, crossing the river via Putney bridge, do a lap in Richmond park (and say hello to the deer), then return to central London via the Thames river path.

Once the route was chosen I just needed to gear up.

**Packing**

I had just bought a running vest (solomon adv skin 12) but it turned out to be the wrong size. So I packed my son's old school backpack. It fits snuggly and has just the right amount of space. The only downside is that I need to take it off to reach my water bottles.

I made sure to bring my favorite anti chafe salve; the swedish army skin salve (available in any well stocked pharmacy back there). I packed a bandage, some band aids, sun glasses (I'm an optimist, sue me), and nail clippers. The latter is great for on trail skin surgery.

My weather app told me it would rain. A lot. But only the first hour or so. I love my taped seam rain jacket but as breathable as it is, it's still pretty warm. Bringing my light wind jacket was a no brainer. Bringing a long sleeved merino base layer felt just as obvious. It would keep me warm after the run, or in case I needed to stop due to injury or other unforeseen events.

The best thing I packed was spare socks and a small plastic bag. If this event included medals I would have forfeited my medal and passed it onto the spare socks. Spare socks rule.

**Food**

Since one of the top goals was to figure out what to eat I packed a lot of different things. Liquorice, chocolate, Gu, Tailwind, a bagel, crisp/chips, Haribo jelly babies and more. Everything was wrapped up in small 150-200 calorie packs. This allowed me to grab any snack every 30-40 minutes and get the right amount of energy.

I also filled two 700ml water bottles; one with Tailwind, one with water.

I was now ready for my most uncomfortable picknick ever.  :)

Just before I left I remembered to bring my debit card. Since my race was self made and self supported I would rely on being able to pay for whatever I might need along the way. Above all I'd need it for my post run lunch! You can say it's your birthday all you like but most places still want cold hard pounds, even *if* they sing you happy birthday first.

**Ready to go!**

This was the moment I had been waiting for. In september 2020 I thought my running career was over for good. Daily physical therapy exercise (at home) and many carefully planned miles later I was finally going to run an ultra marathon. My very first marathon too actually. 

I warmed up outside my front door. The rain was coming down hard. I knew my feet would get wet. I knew there was no point in doing anything about it until it stopped raining. Oh well. Nothing I hadn't done before.

I reminded myself of everything I had planned:

\- Run too slow in the beginning.

\- Walk uphill, even if I feel great.

\- Approach the finish with lots left in the tank.

\- Eat and drink on schedule no matter what.

\- Learning &gt; performance.

**0 km - Weeee!**

I broke my own first commandment immediately. I live on a hill and running downhill slow is just awkward. Plus, I had wanted to try a technique I had heard about; Running downhill fast to avoid tiring my legs by breaking. I loved it. I did it the rest of the run. It simply works. Try it. Unless it's a very technical hill perhaps. 

**5 km**

The first 5 km felt great. Can I do this ten more times? I ask myself. I decided I totally could and kept going with a smile on my face. I run this way to work several days a week. I had to remind myself to slow down. “You’re not just running to work today. Gotta last 5-6 hours”. As I approach Earl's court another friend lets me know he'll join for ""a wee bit"". We enjoyed a nice run together to Putney bridge in the rain. A corona air high five later I am alone again. London. I can't say I enjoyed this bit. Too much traffic and several red lights. But out of nearly 5km to Richmond park, the last 3 were nice and quiet. My feet were more moist than wet. This could work. 

**14km**

For those of you who are not familiar Richmond park is nothing like most London parks. It's a rough patch of land with ponds, mighty oaks and tall ash trees, hundreds of the queen's own deer, rough open fields and beautiful english hills. It is surrounded by trails and a ring road. It’s not quite circular close enough. The ring road is the natural habitat of the common London road cyclists. They’re as many as they’re colorful. But today the rain gave me an empty park. I loved it.

Most of my tailwind bottle was gone by now. I love Tailwind. 200 calories per pack/bottle and quite delicious.

I stopped by the little cafe to see if I could refill my bottles.

A nervous teen in an official cafe apron informs me that ""you're not really supposed to"". I ask him if he'll tell on me. When he decides he won't I refill my bottles from a tap by the counter and take off.

So far so good. My feet feel ok. My knees feel ok. My right ankle feels sore and angry. But **there is a difference between pain and injury.** I decide it's just pain and keep going.

I now get to some of my first hills and I find myself enjoying it. No one sees me fly over the muddy trails apart from herds of deer. They're used to runners and couldn't care less. Even when I stop close to some newborn fawns to get a good picture. I guess runners are just a different species of more colorful deer to them. 

**24 km**

I am 1 click away from meeting my friend. It feels like a major milestone. Most of my long runs leading up to today were between 18 and 24 km. The distance was fine. My pace was fine. My hypothesis was that 5-5:15 minutes / km would feel good. I was right. Too fast for 100km but fine for now. 

Reaching 25 km somehow felt significant. I was now embarking on the second half. The part that would take me to 50 km and unexplored territory (not actual territory, but new experiences).

The rain had slowly stopped over the last few kilometers. I figure this is the best chance I'll get to change my socks so I do just that. As I inspect my feet I see no hot spots, broken skin or other risk areas. Great!

I reflect on my snacks so far. I knew jelly babies would work. I brought them on plenty of long runs before. I knew I disliked the weird texture of Gu but it also made me feel great. Maybe I should use more Gu in the future? Perhaps I'd get used to it? I was looking forward to most snacks, but just the thought of a bagel almost made me puke there and then and I'm not a puker. Weid. I make a mental note. 

I set off to meet my friend. I've mostly stayed on pace. Just over 5 min while running. The total was slower due to walking uphill, red lights etc. I don’t mind. I’m here to learn, not to get a good time.  In my head I was running 100 km. I was going to do everything as if I was running 100km. Only I'd stop at 50. I was dead set on learning everything I could.

**25 km**

I meet my friend and we instantly start running. We chat non stop. I find that I can keep up the pace and the conversation without trouble. In fact I have to slow down. I felt fine at the time, but this pace was probably gonna kill me on a 100km.

**30-40 km**

The Thames river path is 1) Oh so beautiful 2) Oh so repetitive 3) oh so long.

I start feeling like this run is never gonna end. My right knee and hip start hurting. They start getting tight. Just like a few times before I stop to do a few dynamic stretches. It doesn't work. I walk a bit. It still hurts. I suppose this is just what it'll be like from here on. ""Let's go"". I find that I can continue. It's just pain, not an injury. But it isn't fun anymore. We stay on pace or just below. I make up excuses to walk. ""Snack time. Let's walk while I eat this (snack that I always eat on the run otherwise). I stretch more. I do my little mobility exercises. My knee and hip still feel bad but it helps momentarily. We continue.

In my head I had divided the run into segments:

1) Earl's court.

2) Crossing the river

3) Richmond park

4) linking up with my buddy

5) Starting the Thames path

6) Completing my first marathon (on purpose at least. Again, different story).

7) Crossing the river

8) The home stretch.

9) Lunch. Glory. Rest.

I am starting to feel quite excited about completing a marathon. A freaking marathon. I was never supposed to run again and here I am! Screw you world. You can't stop me. Look at this! My knee hurts. I stop. I stretch. My buddy tells me I'm a wuss. He knows how to motivate me. I pick up the pace. Just a bit longer.

We discuss what “milestones” we’ll see. Hammersmith bridge, that one bar, the boat club… It’s a good distraction. Now my friend's knee starts hurting too.”I’ve never actually run this far before” he confesses. 

**43 km**

I did it. I am a marathon runner now. I don't care. There is nothing to be proud of. This isn't even half my race distance. My hip hurts and I'm tired. My last snack was one of the experiments. A small bag of crisp/chips. It was much too greasy. All that fat made me feel terrible.

A sudden wind hits my face and blows my birthday present, an awesome North face running cap, off my head. It wakes me up. I smile as I pick it up from among the startled pigeons. Man. I just ran a marathon. I don't feel that tired. I can do this. I will do this. I'm actually having fun. Here we go!

**45 km - crossing the river**

As we cross the bridge I pick up my phone. Which way to Hyde park? I quickly find the way but it looks terrible. After hours on peaceful, empty gravel roads the hubbub of central london is too much. It's too loud and crowded. There are red lights and cars. The air tastes different. My buddy and I look at each other. ""Wanna continue along the river and call wherever we hit 50 the finish line?"". I can't remember who suggested it but we both agreed. The route we took ended up being worse. The constant google mapping, second guessing our route and stopping for cars took all the fun out of that last push. I had wanted to go really fast the last 3-4 km. It's not gonna happen.

**48.3 - ""I can't go on""**

My amazing running buddy. The guy who agreed to pace me on the spot is hurting. He has never run this far before. In fact he usually sticks to 5-10km. But on his bike he pretty much does a lap around the globe each week. He's strong as an ox and schooled me in our death-by-burpee competition. But it turns out cycling and lifting weights doesn't translate. His knee went from annoying to hurting to locking up. He's done. It’s not worth risking an injury.   I wait with him while he sits down to figure out what to do next. How bad is it?

After a minute or two he decides he can walk. He spurs me on and we decide to meet in the dead center of a nearby cemetery. If I run through it from the south end to the north,and then come back to the middle I've run 50.1 km today. I'm off.

**49 km - this is it**

I'm hurting. I'm happy. I want lunch. I'm experiencing the running high of my life and some of the worst thigh pain I've ever felt all at once. But like so many other endurance athletes I sort of like pain. At least this close to the finish line. I run faster. I realize that my fluid, easy gait is gone. I'm wobbling. Not too much, but enough to notice. I reach the end of the cemetery. I touch the old stone gate and smile. I can see my buddy faaar away. This is it. I sprint (well it felt like sprinting) to the central monument. I wonder if running here is disrespectful. I can't see any mourners and continue. I go faster. Faster! I reach the finish line. I am now, technically, an ultrarunner. I feel happy. Happy that it’s over. Happy that I did it. Happy that I am healthy enough to even train for this. 

I sit down and realize it’s gonna take some serious effort to do so. How am I gonna get up? 

What the hell have I been up to all day? I feel like crap. My legs are hurting. I won't walk straight for a week. How am I gonna do 100km if this is what I feel like after 50? Nothing to celebrate here.

I stand up to meet my buddy. My sancho pancha who agreed with me that the windmills were worth fighting.  I feel great! What an awesome way to celebrate a birthday. What an achievement. I hit all my goals. I completed it. I ran slowly. I walked uphill. I know what foods I like and not. I learned lots. I can do 100km. How? Just like this. Only slower. WIth taped feet. A better backpack and more leg training.

Who knew you could have so much fun in just over 5 hours?!

**What I learned**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Shortly after finishing I got terrible shivers. Bring something warm to wear. I ran in 14 degrees celsius and never felt cold. After a minute of nearly uncontrollable shaking I felt fine. Weird. **Bring something warm for after. Warm pants too**

As I came home I realized my back was aching. Turns out the backpack was unevenly packed. I drank more tailwind than water, leaving one side of the pack lighter than the other.  I never noticed. But as the miles stacked up, so did the tension in my back. **Pack better.**

**Tailwind rocks** . I'm gonna sound like a paid promotion. But this is the best stuff I've ever used for any endurance activity. And I’ve done my fair share of hiking, marching, running and cycling. my next 50 I might just do tailwind and Gu. It would definitely work. 

Licorice was delicious, easy on the stomach and oh so tasty. And unlike the Haribo it didn’t leave my mouth sweet and sticky. **Get more black licorice.**

My quads were very tired. I thought my legs were in good shape. Apparently not. **re-start leg day.** No more full body strength on non running days. Now I need to figure out where to fit in more weighted step ups, pistol squats and lunges. If my quads and calves can feel as good as my cardio on July 3rd I’ll have fun the whole day. 

**Pack spare socks.** I mean duh.

Lube your balls if you have them. It paid off big time. Once again I am reminded that chafing is 100% an avoidable problem. 

**Figure out why my hips hurt.** I clearly need to improve my gait or get stronger or something…

I hope this helps someone. I hope someone enjoys this. Regardless I want to thank this community for all your indirect and direct help. Keep it up!

I didn’t sleep well last night. Too sore and achy. But I also haven’t thought of much else apart from running. I’m gonna take one week off. But soon. Soon I get to run again.

Should I cut weight? Currently 5”11 210lbs. Shoe suggestions for a rocky race? Anyone with experience going from being a heavy lifter to ultra runner?,1620582008
Ultramarathon,skyrunner00,Looking for shoe recommendations for 50+ mile (80+ km) trail distances,"I know this has been discussed multiple times, and I am actually not new to 50+ mile distances. But once again I am trying to find a shoe that will work well for me at these ""long"" ultra distances.

I know the usual recommendations are Hokas (Challenger, Speedgoat) and perhaps some models Altra. But I have quite narrow and long feet (I am male) and high arch, and I need better than average cushion in the front. In the past I've had Morton's neuroma on one foot, and the ball of the foot area on that foot is still somewhat sensitive.

Altras are too wide for me (I tried). Topo shoes are also too wide. I tried Terraventure and it didn't work for me at all. Hoka Speedgoat 2 did work fine for me, and I ran one 50 miler and one 100k in it, but I've heard that Speedgoat 4 has a very thin tongue, and I think that is going to be an issue for me. I've just tried North Face Flight Vectiv, and after a 35 mile race is nearly destroyed my feet - top of my arches were swollen for more than a week after the race and I got two black nails. It was a combination of a relatively light structure with wide front of the shoe and with thin tongue that did that to me. By the end downhills were painful because of the pressure on top of my arch.

What seems to work the best and narrowish shoes that wrap and hold mid-foot tightly and have a thick tongue. For example La Sportiva Mutant works really well and I ran up to 40 miles in it, but Mutant is a bit heavy and has too much heel drop. I've tried the most recent La Sportiva Karacal, but its fit departs from La Sportiva classical fit, and it is a bit too low on the front cushion. It looks like Salomon Ultra Glide might be a promising choice for me, but I tend to struggle with Salomons because somehow my feet are between sizes in Salomon shoes - US 11 feels a bit too short and  US 11.5 feels too long.  


Any other ideas?",1620482793

-Is there anything weird or unusual that you do that you think most people don’t?

-Do you do any exercise the day before (running, light strength training, cross training?)

-Any certain foods, or goals for hydration the day before?

-Psychologically do you do anything to calm the nerves (watch tv, meditate, obsessively study the course, read etc.)?

Also for drop bags, do you ever put any personal items in there like a stuffed animal or toy?

Ultramarathon,mhinimal,re: periodization - and when does training or racing become damaging?,"OK first, I'm new to this. Training for my first trail 50k and looking for some perspective generally, and maybe specific advice secondarily.

1. Do you have an ""ultra season"" where you peak your mileage and then run a couple races in season, and back off the mileage for an off-season and work on something else (such as shorter races, speed, strength etc)? Or are you keeping decently high mileage year round and are always ready to run a race with a few weeks of mileage ramp?

2. Do you find there is a certain threshold of training run length where the damage accumulation outweighs the training benefits? I notice a lot of people in this sub and the ultra community talk about ""preparing their bodies to take a beating"" over a race. In some cases it seems that due to the length, the RACE itself is not beneficial fitness wise, possibly even damaging. Or have you achieved a level of resilience where extremely long runs or races are not actively causing damage?

I am finding a certain threshold of length on training runs seems to push me into overuse injuries. Right now I have been managing to keep them at bay and not requiring more than 1 or 2 recovery days to dissipate, and then I'm good to carry on with my usual weekly mileage. But they are making me hesitant on pushing the long run mileage any further. Because of this, my solution was to shorten my long run by a few miles, and turn it into a back-to-back days long run and work on slowly pushing the mileage on both of those days. And also start slowly adding mileage to the rest of my training days to up my overall mileage without cramming it all into one.

Specific details - I am training on trails exclusively. Generally run about R-8-5-8-R-13-8 but sometimes I make one of those Rests 5-8mi or cross training (rowing) depending how i feel. A fair amount of elevation gain, 5 milers are ~1200ft, 8milers ~1500, long runs ~2000. Race is 50k/4000' gain (3500 loss), most of which is packed into 3 climbs in the first half. and then a bunch of flat and rollers the rest of the course.

When I venture above 13-15 miles (2.5-3 hours) on the long run I start to get nagging issues so I'm reluctant to push it further until I correct those. So, I backed off, added the back-to-back mileage and am just trying to work that combined mileage up. Sound strategy?

I'm not doing this for the glory (well, mostly hah). It's sort of my off-season sport and it's wicked convenient for me right now so I want to work on a monster aerobic base. Not interested in sacrificing my body for a number, but I am interested in training to be fast on my feet for many hours at a time on rough terrain.",1620340762
Ultramarathon,HetWerk,Long-distance hiking and recovery prior to ultramarathon - is 6 days enough?,"First-time poster here. Shout out to all of you for sharing your knowledge. I'm currently training for my first ultra (53KM).

As part of my training plan, I completed my first (trail) marathon on Monday and finished 13th out of 60. At 43 yrs old, I'm pretty chuffed with the result and could not have achieved that if it hadn't been for all the info shared on this forum. Thank you all.

My dilemma - I got my first 53km ultra booked a week after completing a 6 day/119-mile hike (max elevation 200m, non-technical, travelling ultralight, wild camp, based in the UK). Normally, I say the hiking would benefit my conditioning but wonder if I'm leaving enough time to recover.

Ultramarathon,Goalgiggs,First 50k with 6 weeks of training. Need advice!,"I've signed up for my first 50k. A trail race called Dances with Dirt: Gnaw Bone with 6000' elevation.

The longest race I've ever done was about a 12 mile mud run obstacle race. I considered signing up for a marathon before a 50k but I figured on this course it's only 4.2 miles longer so can't be that much harder, right? 

I've been staying in decent shape since January, doing strength and conditioning workouts 3-5x a week and going on multiple runs a week but none farther than 3-4 miles before April. 

I signed up for the 50k and started training long runs on April 5th, with the race being may 22nd. My longest training run was about 18.5 miles in 3 hours and I felt like I still had some more energy at the end of it. Granted that run did not have the terrain or elevation gain I'll experience on the trail.  I've done a few other 17-19 mile days but split the mileage up between a morning and a night run. I didn't look into any training plans or practice back to back long runs as I figured I'm in shape and young enough to just wing it.

Nutrition doesn't seem like it will be an issue for me.
I have a pretty solid stomach and have been able to consume plenty of water and eat stinger waffles, gels, gu's, goldfish, granola bars, etc on all my long runs without any problems. 

With it being just over 2 weeks away, there is not much more training left I can do that I know of. Plan is to do a 10-15 miler this weekend and a few 4-6 milers next week then rest up.

**Goals** 

1. Finish under 7 hours
2. Finish

**Background**

Like a few people who are reading this I really started trail running in 2020. I had done a bunch of road 5k's, 10k's, half's that all went really well... and a few marathons that did not go very well. I have blown up somewhere between mile 15 and mile 20 in each one of my races which has meant I have never accomplished my goal of breaking 4 hours (I did Philly in 4:03 in 2012 and NYC in 4:27 in 2015). So in the beginning of 2020 I had my heart set on finally beating the elusive 4 hour mark after a string of good races in 2019. Well we all know what happened around March so I pivoted to trying to run 1500 miles in 2020. Around the same time my beautiful wife stumbled/discovered/got lost and located a random trail system about .8 miles from our house (we live 20 min from Foxboro MA) which really led to the ""trail life"". After a few hiccups aka rolled ankles we found our stride that summer, and lived on the trails while doing the Limitless Elevation Challenge put on my [Aravaipa](https://www.aravaiparunning.com/). With increased mileage I also increased speed and was hitting numbers I never did when I was younger. In my defense I played football and baseball growing up so doing a ""fun run"" for me was jogging to the goal posts and back. 

After all the above I put my ""official"" 2021 goals out there, which I posted on Strava (no coming back from that).

&amp;#x200B;

**Training** 

My training kicked into gear right on Jan 1st. Like last years goal (which I met) I have set out to run 2021 miles this year, so to keep on track I have run 35 - 60 miles a week. I would say I did 50% of my running on the roads, 40% of my runs on the trails near my house and most of my long runs around [Blue Hills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg2ezQTqTqM), which is a small ski/trail system about 10 miles from Boston (which is crazy if you think about it). 

Once I was hitting 45 mpw without and niggles/injuries I decided to just go out and [run my own 50k](https://www.strava.com/activities/4935048917) around blue hills. I learned a lot of random things, but mainly I knew I could do it so it was time to officially sign up for a race. Unfortunately, MA hasn't fully opened up to allow races (rumors are they are coming soon) so had to look out of state for my first real race. I knew of a few out there within driving distance (Traprock in CT, Blood Rt in Vermont, and of course the Big A). I was waitlisted at Trap Rock but I had my heart set on the Big A so I was ok with it. Due to Maine's Covid restrictions this year, a lottery was held to get in. Well lucky for me, the lottery was held on my birthday which meant I was definitely getting in (which I did).

In terms of specific training I followed either a ton of race plans out there, or none at all. It was a combination of several training plans, with my main focus being getting a lot of elevation on my longer runs. 

**Pre-race**

Due to Covid restrictions (which I was more then fine with so I could run with other humans) there would be no water on the course so it was bring you own stuff/drop bag situation. I had trained with honey stingers waffles, Lara bar's, goldfish pretzels and BPN's [G 1 M Sport](https://www.bareperformancenutrition.com/products/g-1-m-sport). I packed up the Salomon Adv Skin 12 (love it), packed my bag the night before. I felt confident even though it was my first race as I thought I did a fair amount of training on similar trails. I based that off of [video I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiyTqMhKa6g) from a few years ago in which a group of friends did this race. 

After a week of waking up at 4 and eating what I planned to have race morning (bagel and PB), I was ready to go and start the 2 hour drive up. Well I thought I was ready, I got to the end of the block and thought I forgot to pack my lube so I turned around quickly... turns out I did pack it - just a lot of pre race jitters. Drive there was uneventful minus the rain/drizzle I drove through. It was expected and not too heavy so it wasn't a major concern. 

After one quick pit stop (Maine Rest Stop &gt; Porta Potty) I was driving up the last hill to get to the top of the mountain where the race was being held. I noticed some flags waving, but lets just say the top of the mountain (hill) was rather windy, cold and cloudy that morning. Hats off to all the volunteers who were out in the elements helping everyone in terms of parking, handing out bags, etc. I checked in and saw I was in the first wave at 7:30 am (there was waves of 3 minutes due to Covid) which to me was good news. I had less time to worry and over analyze and worry if I hadn't dressed properly. I then put my bag down within the drop area, which is where I had my first ""ohh that is how its done moment"". I had used an old travel bag from college, which to the naked eye looked like overnight bag not a drop bag for a 50k. Lesson partially learned. At 7:15 they took a group photo (when they add it I will edit this post), and gave pre race instructions. I then hit the porta potty (extremely clean) and then waited for the start.

**Course**

[The course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZxyfSd2SugapnInK_CjOj4l4QD1jM1XD/view) was 3 loops that were 10+ miles around the area with about 1800 ft of gain each loop. They preached in the race email to remember Pink -&gt; Blue -&gt; Yellow so I just kept telling myself PBR minus the R because I wasn't sure how well marked the course would be. 

**Race**

Promptly at 7:30 I was off. I saw a few people take off, and well I never saw them again. I fell in behind one runner who was going at a solid pace that I could maintain- at least for the first loop. In my head I told myself I wanted to avg 12 min miles for the first loop. So 12 x 10+ = 120 minutes (roughly) - my math teachers in HS would be so proud. The first part of the loop was basically 2 miles down with an extremely runnable dirt road before you climbed back up to the top of the hill where the start line was.   I felt strong on this part so I passed one guy and caught up to another. After falling in behind on the power hike up we started chatting. This would be the theme of the day, because the people of Maine- super friendly and welcoming. Not sure if all trail races are like this, but I sure hope so. Anyway, he told me about this adventures and different runs he had done (a bunch of 100's, he loves the Grindstone and Wasach). So following his lead (literally) we went through the starting area and were onto the 2nd half of the 10 mile loop (10- 3 = 7 mile portion of the loop - math teacher still proud).

The 2nd half of the loop was a bit more runnable in terms of the trails then the first part. We had fallen into a chat with 2 other guys, and the 4 of us made our way to the turnaround point. We had one guy and one lady pass us but it was somewhat hard to gauge how hard we weren't or were running because of the ""wave aspect"". I believe I was pacing correctly and wasn't overcooking it (which I think I have done in Marathons) based on my ability to chat. This chatting caused me to miss my only turn of the day. I literally ran past and over 2 arrows saying ""turn here"" at which point I heard ""STOPPPPP!!!"" - again course was marked extremely well I just wasn't paying attention. After thanking my lucky stars (and the guys I was with) that I didn't accidently run to far of course I was back on track.

The gentleman discussing 100's had to pull over (I believe he was only running one loop because of a family commitment because I never saw him again), so I semi fell in behind the two other guys - including my new best friend Dan. At this point I felt like I was running too much of the uphill's so I somewhat fell behind and was on my own for a bit. This was a theme for the day where I would find myself falling behind on uphill's then making up ground on the flats and downhill's. 

The end of the 10 mile loop is a 400 ft climb, but it didn't kick my butt as bad as I thought it would (not yet at least) as I didn't finish my water or G1M sport. I pulled into the aid station, told the starter my last name at which point he said I was smidge under 2 hours (ahead of pace!), where my ~~overnight~~  drop bag awaited me. 

WHAT A CLUSTER. I couldn't find my one of water bottles to fill up my flask, when I did find it and fill it up I then couldn't find my screw top for the flask. One of my Honey Stinger Waffles was in my slipper I had worn to the race (I am not making this up, this is literally how poorly prepped my drop bag was) so it took a bit to find. Dan was off as well as the other guy we were with (I never saw him again. Based off running with him for loop 1 he could have held the 12 min mile pace the entire time). After way too much time I was back onto loop 2- Lesson FULLY learned. 

Loop 2 was much of the same. The beginning and end of the 3 mile section was definitely muddier because of the number of racers, but I was running real solid on the runnable dirt road part (maybe too hard). I passed through the starting area and was into the 7 mile portion. Again, more of the same with one person passing me and then Dan catching me (not sure how that happened, I think he stopped at the drop bag area to re stock.) Overall my legs felt good and was running most of the downhills and flats. One issue I had was I started to find it hard to ingest the pretzel goldfish and Lara bars at this time. Another issue was the march back up at the end of the loop was definitely harder as I was out of fluid before coming to the drop bag area. Usually there is extra aid stations for refills on the course but this was a no go because of Covid, but again I did a poor job of preparing for this aspect of the race. I got through that loop a bit over 2 hours which meant I was around 4 hours total (still ahead of pace).

This stop was a bit better in terms of not losing things. I changed shirts as the sun was out and besides the top of the mountain it was getting warm on the trail. Knowing I ran out of fluid at the end of loop 2, I had the bright idea of just taking my hand held water bottle with Nuun tablets and then putting on my vest after the 3 mile portion of the loop.

Fail. First I never checked the Nuun tablet container, I am pretty sure I got it wet at some point because when I opened it the tablets were fused/melted together. So that was a no go, and then I took a good fall at the base of the hill before the climb back up. Good news, the bottle broke my fall- the bad news is when it did it squirted out 50% of what was left. This led to a long and parched throat climb up. Back at the top I put on my vest and was off. I think Dan stopped again but he caught up shortly thereafter. As we begin our trek to the turnaround point we saw one gentleman about to start the last climb up (course loops intersected in a few spots). Not sure his finishing time but pretty sure that it was under 5:30 aka he was cruising. 

On the hike up to the turnaround I had to take a pit stop behind a tree, at which point I thought I was going to be on my own for the rest of the race. So I trudged along trying to maintain my now slower pace (hiking all uphill's and now half of the flat portions and a 1/4 of the downhills). I started calling myself bad words and said just get it done so I picked up the pace, and I thought I was moving at a good clip because I caught up with Dan who was battling a cramp. Turns out I was not moving at a good clip as one young lady flew by me with trekking poles (something I am going to look into), she looked like she was on loop 1 and had tons of energy. Then another guy passed us, with about 3 miles to go (which is right before the big climb) so I began to start telling myself to buck up you have a 5k to go. Adrenaline took over and I was climbing like I was on loop 1 and running a few more of the flat areas and now most of the downhills that remained (unfortunately there was only a few). I turned to Dan and said lets go get them and picked up my speed again.

Well, when I got to bottom of the last big hill I looked up and saw the guy I was trying to catch (probably wasn't going to catch him) halfway up, and turned around and couldn't see Dan (I was a bad new best friend). So I began the climb up solo switching between yelling at myself and trying not to drink what I had left too quickly (it was hot out now). I finally saw the clearing which mean the end of the race was somewhere around 400 meters. I ran it has hard and as fast I could (which was very hard but not very fast) but finished under 7 hours which I was ecstatic about. Dan finished shortly thereafter (a PR for him) and he had a large contingent of friends and family to see it. I have no clue what place I finished because of the waves, but guessing I would say top 20 of 60 people attempting the 50k (results are later this week after they do all the math of you started in X wave and finished in this time). 

**Finishing time:** 6:36:14

**Distance off my watch:** 31.09

**Elevation off of Strava:** 6043 ft

**Post Race** 

I went to my car and changed out of my gross clothes and put on Sandals (thank you to my wife for that as well as handling our two small boys at tee ball practice). I then went back, thanked Dan for keeping me sane on my first race, thanked the race directors and took a few pictures. I then began the drive home- where I made one stop and had the best damn Wendy's frosty of my life.

**The Future**

I think I am going to try and get into the Twisted Branch 100k because I haven't had any ""never again"" moments after the race. I am definitely going to purchase/change the way I do drop bags and look into Gu's/Gel's, salt tablets and trekking poles. I am also going to work on power hiking the up hills harder because based off this race that is a weak point.

With so many options I’m torn between suunto/coros/garmin and if it’s worth it to push the $500+ price tag for the garmin 945/fenix or stick to something like the coros apex or suunto 9. 

I live in Indiana so barometer technology isn’t exactly pertinent given the incredible lack of altitude but that’s not to say I won’t find myself in a race or backpacking trip out west at some time.

Ultramarathon,IronUltra,My first 50 miler done yesterday! 7:49:16. Race report,"What a great day! Thanks to all for the advice I have snagged from various posts. 

I did (8) 6.16 mile loops around my neighborhood, and then threw in a little small section for the final mileage. I live in Boulder CO and have plenty of beautiful trails but I actually love road running. I love watching my pace. Maybe one day I’ll get in to trail running, but I really do love road running. My course was very flat, only 1,500 feet of elevation gain and loss total. I ran the course for months and every time would track the exact mileage of the loop. A few weeks ago I averaged all of the loops so I would have a good guess as to the exact loop length. It probably varied by around 0.03 miles based on the day during my training runs. The first 31ish was self supported. I swapped hydration vests (both ultimate direction) at mile 18 to get more water and food. At mile 31 my wife met up with me and biked the rest and had some water bottles and food on her bike. 

My race plan was to run the first 30 at a 9 min mile then slow down to a 10 min mile for the last 20. I executed it perfectly. I do not know why, but by mile 20 my quads were completely shot. They felt so bad, worse than any training run I have ever done. Even my back to back long days. Bag of bricks bad. Pain every step. I’d say that I physically ran 20 miles and mentally ran 30. It was a brutal day but I loved it. 

I ate shot bloks (caffeinated ones starting at mile 20) and granola bars and stoop waffle and jelly beans. I took water every mile on the dot when my mile alarm went off on my watch. Drank some but a lot goes to cooling me down. I am a firm believer in training with nutrition and hydration every workout. It works for me. I always take water on every run and drink every mile. I practice this way bc this is how I always race. Any workout over 45 min I also take nutrition. I eat around 65-75 calories every 20 minutes. I have a timer to remind me to eat. Every 30-60 min I take a salt stick capsule. I adjust based on temperature and my effort level. Towards the end I stopped eating on the timer and ate to hunger. In Ironman my stomach used to shut down at around mile 15ish on the run. I decided to be less rigid and eat to Hunger towards the end based on stuff I read here. It was a game changer for me. 

My training topped at 51 mile week which included a back to back weekend of 12/27. My 19 week plan I made for myself started with my weekly mileage at 20 miles a week. A fast build yes, but I know my body well from years of Ironman many years ago. Before starting the 50M plan I did 3 months of 20 mile a week speed work because I thought I wanted to try and see how fast I could do a 13.1. At the end I changed my mind and decided to try a 50M instead and shifted my training in to that, and made my 19 week plan. My weekday runs were 6 miles each at the end. 1 was hill repeats and 1 was either a recovery pace or speed intervals. All but 1 run a week (the longest one) was in my treadmill. I also biked 5 days a week. Some were just 30 minutes to loosen the legs, but I did (1) 90 minute “hill” ( hard gear low cadence) and (1) 75 min ride a week. All biking was done indoors on the trailer. In a previous life I raced Ironman and after getting hit by a car I did a lot of trainer riding and learned to love it. 

A lot of what I read suggested a run/walk strategy. For me, that was not something I was personally interested in trying. I know it works for many people. And maybe I would have done better if I tried it. But my goal was to run the race. I did walk a total of maybe 5 minutes at most. Most were 20-30 second walking breaks up a hill. It was by no means planned or consistent. Partly physical breaks but also partly mental to allow me a reprieve from thinking about and overcoming the pain. 

My big goal was to go sub 8 hours. I really didn’t know if that was possible. At around mile 45 I realized I could go sub 7:50. I made sure that happened. It was pure and utter pain (soreness) every step but I just didn’t care. 

A nice phrase I picked up on here and said a lot to myself is that “pain is not linear”. I felt so fucking sore at mile 20. In all my dark moments I kept thinking “if I feel this bad now, I can’t even imagine what I will feel like at mile 25. Or 30. Or 35. Or XYZ”. As it turns out, my legs stayed pretty equally bad for the next 20 miles. The pain did not get worse like I thought it would.  At around 40 they hit a whole new level or bad. Like a hammer hitting my quad every step I took.  I kept seeing myself running my intended pace even though my quads were begging me to stop. If I could run that pace in that pain, I knew I was ok. And every mile was a reminder that just because it hurts every step, I most certainly don’t NEED to stop or to walk. I WANTED to, but my body was capable of handling it. 

Anyways, that’s way too much writing. This forum has been great to me. Thank you to everyone that posts here. I learned so much!",1619392162

Ultramarathon,renee23nl,Garmin: run vs treadmill run,"Hey all, I’ve tried looking this up but I can’t find a decent explanation and it’s driving me nuts.  Since I’m pretty new to running, I’m betting a lot of you have looked into this as well and may have figured it out already.

The difference in distance traveled on my treadmill and on my garmin when recording a treadmill run is between 15 and 20%, with garmin saying I’ve traveled further.  I checked my treadmill (it’s not perfect but much closer with 1km on display equal to 0.987km measured).  Seriously - normal people wouldn’t care about this 🙄😂.

Ultramarathon,quinnfsrose,Is an ultra valuable physical conditioning for another race?,"Here's what I mean. I'm signed up for my first 100 at the end of August. I'm considering a 50 miler B race a month before. If my mileage is high and I'm mentally ready (I've completed this same 50 miler three times before and I'm as ready and able to suffer and persevere as I will be by August) then would it be a good thing for the 100 or a bad thing?

I know long runs are valuable, but when training for a 100 does the body toughen up more after a 12 hour long run than a 4-5 hour one? Or would it be better to just take a 30-40 mile mountainous long run nice and slow and stretch it out to 10 hours? Is a 50 going to help me tune up my pace and get in a perfect long run a month out or is it just going to mess with my mileage and force me to sit a week out to recover right when I should be peaking before the taper? 

I'm really on the fence. I had a great build up so far and I'm hoping to be conditioned enough that I could do it and recover fairly quickly and have low risk of bad injury, but I don't know. 

Thanks for the feedback.",1619254768

I'm curious how you approach focusing on matching the profile/elevation gain while training.  Currently I'm running 4 days/week, 2-3 on trails (weekly long run always on trails).  I've been matching the elevation/mile on 2 of those runs but it's more roller coasters instead of big climbs, and every couple weeks I'll do my long run on a route that has big climbs/descents in it.

Over the past 4 years, I’ve run 3 marathons and a self-supported/not official race 50k. I’m running my second (also self-supported/not official race) 50k in a few weeks.

I am feeling the itch to try to run a 40 miler at some point this year, but I’m not sure how to structure training following the 50k. I’m not finding many plans for that distance, as it’s not as common as 50k or 50mi—given that it’s in the middle of those two distances, should my training resemble more of a 50mi plan? Is that overkill? 

For reference, I’m running around 40mpw and strength train 3-4 of those days. Is this enough to train appropriately for a 40 miler? I’m planning to take some time following the 50k to continue building a strong base, as I’ve only done one 20 and one 22mi run during this training cycle.

Ultramarathon,Ultra-Trex,Wild Canyon Ultra (50K) Race Review,"Quick race review of the Wild Canyon Ultra.   I had planned on the 100K but had to drop to the 50K due to persistent injury and even that was rough.  

The course is a mix of access road (clay and asphalt), single track (clay) and scrambling up a 450' cliff.  No lie.  About a 1000' of sustained vertical over the course of about 2 miles at one point.   A lot of hard surfaces though, road training is a big plus to take the feet beatings.  My feet hurt more during this 50k than my last 100 mile.  

The course is a 15.5 (ish) loop, repeat as needed for the 25K, 50K and 100K. 

I've attached some pictures, hopefully they make it.   The scenery was very reminiscent of a race I did in Moab just a lot redder.  Plenty of Texas badlands scrub undergrowth, catci patches and a whole lot of red rock. 

The race was very well done, well supported and with great water.  I don't know about you but I've hit AS's where the water tasted like gardenhose left out in the summer sun.   Not often but when it happens it's just ewww.  But here it was perfect. 

It was a 'hands free' race due to the pandemic so the volunteers just made sure the tables were full and that was it.  Refill your own bottles etc. 

Nutrition was all pre-packaged in single serve sizes.  Cookies, chips, crackers, M&amp;M's, date bars (good and plenty brand) and Hammer gels and electrolytes.   I'd never tried Hammer drink mix before and after trying the orange (alleged) flavor of their drink mix I'll never do it again. ;)  Love the endurolyte electrolyte tabs mind you but that orange was... awful. 

A new course record of 12+ hours was set for the 100k and they earned it IMO.   Me I was just glad to finish my 50K without falling off a cliff.  

Accommodations are sparse, the closest two towns have populations of about 400 each.   There's a boarding house / hotel in Turkey Texas, built circa 1927 that I stayed out and it had all the rustic charm one might expect.  Very few rooms so reserve early like months early. 

Plenty of tent camping in the park if you want to do that as well.

Ultramarathon,grouchybear47,A question about mixed training to build aerobic base,"TLDR at the bottom and mobile user so apologies for formatting. 

For starters, a little background. I used to be a 1-2 marathon per year runner and I did one 50k. I ended up needing a surgery in late 2019 followed by a new tiny human and the rona lockdown, so my training fell off completely. I’m finally starting the climb to where my mileage was pre-surgery but my time is much more constrained. 

I find that I can do a solid 5k while pushing the running stroller after work and once the baby goes to bed I’ll knock out another 30-60 minutes on the stationary bike. My weekly running mileage is only 15-ish, but I’m slowly ramping up as I drop the extra weight gained during lockdown. My combined training time is around 8-9 hours per week at 50/50 run/bike. That should change as my long runs get longer though. 

Now here’s the question: has anyone had success with building up their aerobic base doing roughly half their weekly training time on a bike? I’m thinking that I will tackle a marathon this fall, 50k next spring, 50 miler by fall 2022, and so on. I plan on slowly ramping up the weekly miles but a big chunk will have to be my long runs. A big reason for this strategy is due to my work schedule and wife having to do most of the baby care during the week, so I take the little one on my runs to give her a break. I’m making do with my situation, but I’d love to hear about anyone else’s stories and advice.


TLDR; Surgery, lockdown, and wonderful new family addition halted training, now I only have a few short windows to run/bike to get the needed training volume. Most runs beside the long one are done with a running stroller. Any advice?",1618797847

The race: would be my first 50k and includes over 6k' vert &amp; 5k' descent, four full aid stations. Last day of July. 10 hour cutoff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I've been running for about 10 years but spent a majority of that time very casually just working on 5k's. I worked up to longer distances over the past two years. I'm not fast, but I have pretty strong endurance. I usually focus on mountaineering in the summer, so am very used to big vert days (at a walking pace). Last year I trained up to 20 miles w/ 4k' vert but ended up injuring my knee and spraining my ankle so had to take about 5 months off. I'm back in the swing of things now but my current long run is only 14 miles w/ 2500.' That particular run felt pretty good and my overall pace (for all my runs throughout the week) is faster &amp; more comfortable than last year. I'm feeling really strong overall, but I'm definitely afraid of overtraining like I did last year and getting hurt, so I'm being really conservative about mileage increases. I'm not great at running vert, but can definitely speed walk it. All of my long runs are on technical single track in the mountains. I'm not following a specific plan, just kind of doing what I know works for me. Each week I do 1 long run, one speed work out (usually a 5k), and one or two moderate runs. I increase these runs as I go, but again, trying to be conservative. Will be adding stadium stairs / hill repeats to my work outs.

Ultramarathon,Laresu,How valuable is a shoe which works for you?,"Hey all,

I know the only thing more annoying than asking for shoe advice is asking ‘why does my knee hurt?’, but I’ve got a more specific query than just looking for shoe recommendations.

I began my trail running about 18 months ago in a pair of Salomon Sense Ride 2’s, which have been really good to me. After putting many hundreds of km’s through them, I’ve decided that it’s time for a new pair. 

I went straight for the Sense Ride 4’s, since that is the current iteration, but found that they seem far more firm under foot than the 2’s, so I’ve been turned off them. So now I’m cast out into the the big wide world of shoes, with endless options at my fingertips - Altra’s, Hoka’s, many shiny new things catching my eye.

I have, however, also been able to find a pair of the ole reliable 2’s online - seemingly one of the last few floating around. Given I have gone 18 months (touchwood) injury free and with no major issues or hotspots/blisters etc. in them, I assume they’re good shoes for me - but because I started my running journey in them, I just don’t know how much ‘better’ things could be, because I’ve never tried anything else. 

I guess the crux of my question is: how value is a reliable shoe? Is it a case of ‘stick with it at all costs, because they’re like gold’, or is it ‘branch out, because it’ll be okay and you’ll most likely be fine with your new shoes (or even better)’? I just haven’t sampled enough shoes to know what I like in terms of stack height, drop, etc., let alone what might prevent/cause injuries to me.

Then I did a couple bigger days with more elevation change and more intensity than normal. Feeling really good cos I'm getting back my legs after a lazy and overweight winter.

I did an 18 mile day and was pretty sore after but just generally all over . No specific knee issues, took a rest day then did 10 miles Monday. No issue while out, felt strong and great... then boom I got pain in my knees after standing and cooking in kitchen several hours after run. Outside of knees again but this time pain was more internal.

My knees hurt all Monday evening, could feel sensations inside the knee and were quite warm to the touch. I rested and elevated and it calmed a lot after Monday. I babied them for a couple of days and thought they're getting better.... Figured just take a few days off. 

Yesterday just in my house up and down stairs several times over the day no pain and feeling fine but knees super super warm by bedtime. Same happened when I popped out to the shop and walked about half a mile on Friday. I iced them but not much else.

I think that I need to RICE a lot more instesely than I was? Tbh I wasn't taking it very seriously as it wasn't anything major.....but now I'm a little worried about it... what is it? what can I do to help more?

Ultramarathon,thatcrazyrunnergirl,How I won the ultramarathon I ran (50 miles) my training/race recap,"Hello ultra-awesome marathoners of reddit! I posted in r/ultrarunning as well, but the discussion was so fun I thought I'd post here too! 

Last week I ran my first ever 50 mile ultramarathon (St. George Lake to Lake 50 mile) and somehow managed to swoop in for 1st place in the women's ultra. Ran 9:43, which I know is not such a crazy amazing time to write home about, I was a bit disappointed since I had planned to not only break 9 hours, but really wanted to break 8 hours.... and I thought I could based on my training... but things don't always go how you plan them. 

Training: 

First off, really stepped up my weekly volume from previously 45-60 MPW, gradually going all the way up to 80 MPW. That was definitely scary for me, but my body adapted so well, I honestly felt like I could've done more, but of course, since it was my first ultra, I didn't want to push things and get injured. 

2) I really amped up my strength training for this training block. Previously, when I finally managed to qualify for Boston (3 times now) I noticed adding a little bit of strength training to my routine paid out HUGE dividends, so I decided if I really wanted to run longer, faster, and stronger, I needed to kick it up a notch in that department. I pretty much doubled the length of my workouts (squats, lunges, core work, resistance band training for hips and glutes etc.) and added more plyo training i.e. jump squats. After mostly all of these workouts I was sore the next day, but I tried to balance it (with decent success) so that I wouldn't be so sore that when I went to run it would get in the way. After I got warmed up the soreness would quiet down. 

3) Speed work 2x a week with lots of variety. Sometimes longer tempo runs, some progression runs, mile repeats, yassos, just tried to switch it up every week to something different. 

4) long runs. I did back to back long runs every weekend (shorter 10-15 mile distance on Sat and then 30-40 mile distance on Sunday). Basically all of my long runs (maxing out at 10/40 back to back Saturday/Sunday) I was able to run at 9:30 or less a mile. So I was really planning on running under 8 hours on the race. Sadly, no dice for me this time around. I really wish somehow I could've gotten some heat training in... I knew my race was going to be in St. George, but it was March and I was hoping the heat wouldn't really hit me this early in the year. But alas, giant heat wave came in just the weekend of my race bringing temps from mid 50s up near the 80s just for me. That pretty much killed me for a good 3 hours where I was running 12 minute miles.  

Race Day: 

Got started at 7am and killed it, right on target pace for the first 25 miles. I was doing great on hydration, nutrition, heart rate zone, no blisters, everything... Of course then day heated up and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I kept dunking my shirt in water to keep myself cool, but it was still brutal. I do badly in the heat just in general, way worse than the average runner. But especially coming from training all winter long in Utah (my hottest run was when I trained on the course 3 weeks prior and it was 50 degrees) I just couldn't handle it very well. I did manage to keep running, at least, never had to stop and walk (other than very short intervals on really steep and gravelly hills where I just felt like running was inefficient). But in the end, it didn't matter too much as it turned out the women's field competition was not very steep, and 9:43 was enough to snag 1st place after all. 

Definitely will be coming back and trying to break that 8 hour barrier though...  

Lastly, I made a video with some really basic ultra tips (things that worked for me, things that I did badly) if you want to check it out head over here: [https://youtu.be/Z1oE2O9Z4Mo](https://youtu.be/Z1oE2O9Z4Mo) and subscribe if you'd like to see more.

Ultramarathon,Tired_Thief,Advice for running in the snow?,The past weekend I went running on the superior hiking trail up in northern Minnesota. I really love hiking the trail and recently started running on it but I encountered some difficult with the snow. Some of it was only ankle deep which was no big deal but most of my run was spent stumbling through knee deep snow. I was so frustrated and exhausted that i quit my run after only 15 miles but I'm wondering if I shouldn't have done that. I love being on the trail and I really want to run it. Is the deep snow just a part of being a distance runner? Am I just not cut out to run the sht? Do I just need to build mental strength and push though the tough runs?,1615990141

Wed: AM: 30mins strength PM: 1.5hrs Easy run
Thursday: 1Hr threshold or Tempo biketrainer  PM: 1.5 hours easy run
Fri: AM: 30mins strength
Sat: 2hrs outdoor ride PM: 30mins Easy run

All run are on trails so mileage differ depending on snow dump.
Tues and Thursday bike sessions serve as “interval workouts” - Dunno if this will work.

A few days later, I went for a run and my body immediately shut down, I got sick, and I experienced over training syndrome for about the next 8 weeks.

At that time (end of sept 2020) I got post nasal drip, which hasn't gone away since. I've always breathed through my mouth and have been fairly stuffed up, but this is a bit more. It's not really effecting my day to day life, its just kinda annoying. Has anyone else experienced something like this? 

I have gone to the doctor for this. He said it's not really an issue unless it starts effecting my day to day life. He suggested I try to look at factors that changed when it started (air quality, wildfires, allergies etc, etc).

Ultramarathon,TheOfficialLostBard,Imagining Major League Ultrarunning,"**Summary**

The competitive landscape in American Mountain Ultra Trail Running is fragmented. Most start lines are thin on talent. And there is no organizing theme linking the majority of races - almost every event exists on its own island. So it’s no surprise that many of the best male and female runners head overseas to seek out the best competition the sport has to offer. 

To make American ultra races more compelling to elite runners, I propose the formation of “Major League Ultrarunning” (MLU), which:

* Builds on top of and expands the pre-existing [“Golden Ticket” series](https://www.wser.org/golden-ticket-races/) schedule.
* Forms 7-person female and male teams in every major trail running location across the country.
* Hosts a year-long 10 race season that culminates in a championship event every June at the Western States 100.

Read the full post below. 

*\*Disclaimer: this post is written through the particular lens of* *competitive* *Mountain Ultra Trail Running. It* *does not* *consider all the other elements that make this sport great.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Introduction** 

The lack of structure and standardization in American Mountain Ultra Trail Running is frustrating. Think about it. How many races (large and small) and event brands (corporate and cottage) do we have in the United States? There are a lot. 

From a competitive standpoint, it’s a problem. Rarely do we have more than 3 or 4 competitive women and men on any given start line. There are, of course, a few races with significant depth that come to mind - mostly those affiliated with the Golden Ticket series. Otherwise, it’s bleak. 

Saturation and disarray aren’t the only issues. Most elite runners simply don’t associate this region of the world with the best professional and competitive opportunities. They instead go overseas, to participate in events logically connected within more formal systems like the [Salomon Golden Trail Series](https://www.goldentrailseries.com/) and [Ultra Trail World Tour](https://www.ultratrail-worldtour.com/races/).

A few questions are worthwhile to address from all of this:

&amp;#x200B;

* How do we increase the number of elite female and male runners on more American start lines? 
* What can we do to encourage more elite runners to devote the majority of their annual performance calendars to American races? 
* Can this be addressed by linking together more races?
* Can this be addressed by uniting runners around actual team-based frameworks?
* Furthermore, is this initiative desirable...or are we satisfied with the status quo?

**Start By Expanding The Golden Ticket Series**

I’m certainly not satisfied. That’s why I’m writing this post! So, I propose the following.

We start by testing the waters. In the first 2 to 3 years of this initiative, we build on top of what is already working and take small, but progressive steps towards the formation of a professional league. In my opinion, the most exciting competitive space in American Mountain Ultra Trail Running is the “Golden Ticket” series held over a 4 month stretch every year from January to April. So, we capitalize on that.

The Golden Ticket series, listed below, is currently composed of 3 races where top 2 female and male finishers secure automatic entry into the Western States 100 that year.

&amp;#x200B;

1. January - Bandera 100k (TX)
2. February - Black Canyon 100k (AZ)
3. April - Canyons 100k (CA)

I propose expanding the field from 3 races to 10 races and pushing the start back from January to July of the previous year with the series still culminating with a championship event at the Western States 100 the following June. This expanded field of races would be geographically comprehensive, including more of the Southeast, West Coast, and Mountain West. 

It might look something like this (incorporating more distances true to the final race as well):

&amp;#x200B;

1. [July - Hardrock 100m (CO)](https://hardrock100.com/)
2. [August - Cascade Crest 100m (WA)](http://www.cascadecrest100.com/)
3. [September - Bear 100m (UT)](https://bear100.com/)
4. [October - Cloudsplitter 100m (KY)](http://www.cloudsplitter100.com/CSHome.shtml)
5. [November - Golden Gate 100k (NorCal)](https://www.goldengatetrailclassic.com/)
6. [December - Hellgate 100k (VA)](https://extremeultrarunning.com/hellgate-100k/)
7. [January - Bandera 100k (TX)](https://www.tejastrails.com/bandera)
8. [February - Black Canyons 100k (AZ)](https://aravaiparunning.com/network/blackcanyon/)
9. [March - Sean O’Brien 100k (SoCal)](https://sob5050.com/)
10. [April - Canyons 100k (CA)](http://e3running.com/canyons-100k)
11. [June - Western States (NorCal, Championship)](https://www.wser.org/)

Initially, the series would retain the same rules. The top 2 male and female runners from each of these races would secure automatic entry into Western States, increasing the number of golden tickets from 6 to 40. This move would deepen the competitive field at Western States and give the American ultrarunning community an exciting competitive narrative to follow year-round.

So, we start with that. For at least a couple of years, we operate on an expanded, more geographically and competitively inclusive Golden Ticket series that features 10 races over 10 months instead of 3 races over 4 months. Then we study the results. Some interesting questions will naturally arise. For example:

* Does this expanded series increase competition at each golden ticket start line? 
* Will elite runners use this expanded format to take multiple cracks at golden tickets?
* Will this motivate more elite runners to race in America and compete in the series?
* Should races be distributed equally across the country or concentrated in the west?
* Will this expanded series prove the value and demand for a professional league?
* Will fans of the sport appreciate and avidly follow this expanded format?
* Will brands take more interest in this format, and thus invest in the sport?

It will be interesting to see what happens. Of course, the answers, especially to the final questions here, will determine whether there is enough momentum to move forward with a full-fledged league.

**If The Expansion Is Successful, Establish Major League Ultra Running**

Assuming the success of this trial series expansion, we move forward with the creation of a full-fledged league. For the sake of this article, let’s call it “Major League Ultrarunning” \*(MLU). 

Once I publish this article, I will read the feedback and incorporate what makes sense into this vision. For now, here are some ideas:

* All of the premier trail running locations across the United States would get a team. 

There would be 10 to start: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Asheville, NC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina)
2. [North Conway, NH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Conway,_New_Hampshire)
3. [Bend, OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon)
4. [San Francisco,CA ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)
5. [Salt Lake City, UT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City)
6. [Flagstaff, AZ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona)
7. [Seattle, WA ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle)
8. [Boulder, CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado)
9. [Boise, ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho)
10. [Bozeman, MT ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman,_Montana)

&amp;#x200B;

* Every city/region would host a women’s and men’s team with 7 members on each roster. Each team member would have to be located within the metropolitan area of the city. Denver and Colorado Springs runners, for example, would be rolled into the Boulder team. Park City and Provo, for another example, would be rolled into Salt Lake City.
* Each member would be required to participate in at least 2 of the MLU events, in addition to the championship race, (3 total) in order to accumulate points for the team and keep standings throughout the regular season. Some variation of cross-country points scoring would be used. 
* There also would be a minor league/farm team competing in each city in a parallel league with it’s own season, 7-person rosters, and set of regular season and championship races. 

Here is what I am thinking:

&amp;#x200B;

1. [July - Vermont 100 (VT)](https://vermont100.com/)
2. [August - Eastern States 100m (PA)](https://easternstates100.com/)
3. [September - Run Rabbit Run 100m (CO)](https://www.runrabbitrunsteamboat.com/)
4. [October - Grindstone 100m (VA)](https://eco-xsports.com/events/grindstone-100/)
5. [November - Javelina Jundred 100m (AZ)](https://aravaiparunning.com/network/javelinajundred/)
6. December - Headlands 100m (NorCal)
7. [January - HURT 100m (HI)](https://hurt100.com/)
8. [February - Rocky Racoon 100k (TX)](https://www.tejastrails.com/rocky100)
9. [March - Georgia Death Race 120k (GA)](https://www.runbumtours.com/georgia-death-race-1)
10. [April - Zion 100k (UT)](https://vacationraces.com/ultras/zion/)
11. [June - Bighorn 100m (MT, Championships)](https://bighorntrailrun.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

* What would make this minor league particularly interesting is that, at the end of every season, the 4 highest performing female and male runners from the minor league championship teams  and the 4 lowest performing female and male runners from the last-place major league team would swap teams. This would be similar to how the European Premiership soccer league [promote and relegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation) entire teams at the end of every season. It would serve as an interesting motivating factor for players and celebrate true meritocratic ideals of competition.

Altogether, there would be interesting competitive dynamics in both the major and minor leagues: 

* Which team members race in which races? What kind of strategy is involved here? And how do runners adapt to the demands of the schedule?
* How do teams train together? Are most team members training in isolation? Or are they getting together often (or even daily) for workouts, long runs, and shakeouts?
* How do teams peak for Western States (Major League) and Bighorn (Minor League)? 

There would be interesting professional dynamics: 

* Does this league encourage more elite runners to compete stateside? 
* How might recruitment work to bring certain runners to compete for certain cities/regions?

And there would be interesting business dynamics: 

* What races would be included on the circuit in the lead-up to Western States for the major league, as well as on the minor league circuit in the lead-up to Bighorn? And would those two named races end up being the championship events? 
* Would this system in general benefit race directors as a whole?
* Would this system in general benefit trail running-related brands stationed here in America?

**Conclusion**

Imagine having upwards of 40 competitive women and men on any given start line in this league. Imagine what that could do for individual performances, and generally for the competitive-side of the sport. Imagine the second and third order effects for fans, race directors, sport-related brands, and local economies supported by these races.

Of course, what ultimately I like about the concept of Major League Ultrarunning is that it standardizes competition and creates an exciting new format and paradigm for the community to rally around. There is an annual, coherent organization of competition that logically includes the best runners and most captivating races across the country. It also gives runners something to compete for beyond themselves - now they have a team and a city to represent. 

But this is just an initial idea that I felt compelled to get out there on the internet. I want to hear from all of you. What are your thoughts? Is this something worth pursuing? How can we make it better? Looking forward to the feedback.

Ultramarathon,cslola1994,Need help adjusting my training plan,"Hey guys!! First time posting but have been following this sub for about a year. I received some news today that throws a wrench into my training plans and was hoping someone in here could help. 

I am currently training for the Laurel Highland Ultra (50K) and using Hal Higdon’s 26-week training plan: 

https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/ultramarathon-50k/

On the 18th week it suggests running a marathon, so I signed up for the Newport RI marathon on April 17th. However, I got an email this morning saying the race will be moved to May 22nd, which would be during week 23 of my training. 

I’d love some feedback on whether this change is harmless, if I should do the race but make adjustments to the final weeks of the program, or scrap it altogether. For some background, I am a 26F who has been running since I was 14. This will be my third full marathon and first ultra. I am currently on week 13 of training and it’s going really well so far. 

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance 

TL;DR the marathon I was going to run during my ultra training got pushed much closer to the ultra and I want to know how to adjust properly",1615505354

Ultramarathon,Running4water,Barefoot/minimalist running limitations?,"Iv created this post to generate creative thoughts and invite adverse insights and experiences, so please understand this topic should and most likely will have varying points of view. 

I have been a runner and athlete my entire life. Most of my running experience is relative to the past year as I have made a major commitment to training for a wide variety of ultra marathons. With that being said I have made an immense amount of progress in a very short period of time. I feel I owe most of my success to the mastery of a proper barefoot running technique. I do not run entirely barefoot. I run in vivo barefoot shoes both on the road and trail covering distances from 50k-100k. My concern is primarily around road running and speed. Is there a limit to how fast and far one can run in barefoot shoes? Sub six minute mile paces? Or 100 milers on the road? These are two different conundrums on my mind as I am now entering a whole new wheel house of ultra running. Anyone’s experiences and insights are welcome. 

(My story 👇)

My decision to commit to barefoot foot wear steamed from some mild injuries and what I thought was a lack of mastery in the realm of proper running technique. In February of 2020 I began my journey of barefoot running by performing daily plyometric drills on a grassy field with intermittent jogging. Typically covering 2-3 miles a day just performing my daily drills. Going into the month of March I began adding an additional 2-3 miles of running on smooth asphalt around the park to begin introducing a level of progressive overload so I could begin running again. As I entered April of 2020 I was ready to begin developing an aerobic base. While still focusing on my grassy drills and 2-3 mile jogs I was focusing on venturing out to hilly trails running the up hills and walking the down hills. This was in attempt to strengthen my joints and to completely relearn how to walk and run on a variety of gradients. While primarily focusing on getting in a ‘long run’ so to speak. As I began progressing through the month of April my running form was starting to hold form and was getting much stronger. Once May came around I was comfortably running 30-40 miles a week at very easy controlled paces around 9-11 minute miles depending on the terrain. To really kick things into gear I ran my first 50k in June of 2020. To me this what solidified that I had fully grasped the basics of barefoot running and had overcame my past injuries. Now I was ready to begin training a bit more seriously.

To consolidate my progressing from my 50k in June till now. I have finished 5 ultra marathons races. While also completing plenty of 50k plus long runs in training. I have never felt to strong and fit. I could most likely wake up on any given morning and run a sub 4 hour 50k on flat ground. I’m no longer afraid of any distance as I feel I have become incredibly astute at running on tired legs. It’s be over 6 months since Iv had less than a 50 mile running week and usually average around 70 a week while having a few 80-90 mile weeks under my belt as well. Recently I have been focusing on a little bit less volume and more quality speed sessions to progress my top speeds as I know I will eventually like to run some more serious times at the longer single day ultra distances 50-100miles. My thought was to get a little faster and more efficient before committing to upping my weekly volume to prepare for such distances. That being said I am now staring to throw down some sub 6 minute mile splits and it has me questioning my barefoot running. I can’t tell if I just haven’t adapted to running efficiently at those speeds with barefoot technique or If it’s just to much stress for my body to handle. I’v gone through this uncertainty in the past and have over come it before but Im curious if there will be a speed or distance; perhaps a combination of the two where I would need to start using a shoe like Altra (zero drop and foot shaped, yet cushioned). I know I need more time to make these 5:30-5:50 splits more comfortable but the underlying concern still lingers. Especially as I am about to start a new training block for road 100k with 5000ft of loss in the second half this summer. I have plenty of time to train but I’m concerned I might need to doing something different with foot wear for that race and if not sometime in the future. If there’s anyone out there running fast and far in barefoots or knows of anyone I’d love to hear your experiences as I do not know of anyone running fast times in minimalist/barefoot shoes for ultra distances. 

This post seemed lengthy enough and yet I have skipped over quite a few details. Please present any questions you may have. 🤙",1615328464
Ultramarathon,plesnivi,Seeking advice about HR Zones,"I have a question about HR Zones.  I'm running constantly 10km 5'30''/km average HR 160/170 b/min  3x week.  Its a speed i'm comfortable at running, can speak full sentences and could easily do a faster pace for 10km.  I'm just confused about my HR and would be happy to hear some suggestions. 160/170 is a 80-85% for me which i read that is a ""grey zone"" where its too hard for aerobic and to easy for full effort and there is less improvement in cardiovascular system, endurance as if i would run slower with lower HR. The problem is in order to run under 140 beats/min (70% and lower) i have to run extremly slow which isn't that fun (6'30""/km). 

Should i just run in the speed of fast walking in order to be in right HR Zone or just push it?

Ultramarathon,slackmeyer,Your experience with Lasik surgery,"After a couple decades wearing contacts, I am close to taking myself into getting Lasik surgery for my mild nearsightedness (my prescription is -2.25, -2.75).  I figured that it would be nice not to have to put in contacts, and I could eliminate the discomfort and occasional cloudiness/blurred vision I get in long runs (over 12 hour runs let's say).  But This well researched irunfar article [vision loss in ultramarathons](http://www.irunfar.com/2017/10/vision-loss-in-ultramarathons-looking-at-the-research.html) has me thinking twice.  Now I'm thinking that Lasik could make the issue worse, and even if it's not something that will permanently damage my vision, long runs are important to me and contacts are a known thing that has worked fairly well for a long time for me.

Any personal experiences with this?",1614835730
Ultramarathon,doyouevenoperatebrah,Warm up and pacing,"Hi all,

Some background quickly; I’ve been consistently running for about a year, working through couch to 5k, 10K, and half marathon programs. I’ve just started a marathon training program, with the goal of completing it around June 1, taking a short rest and then doing a 50k training program, with the goal of running a 50k in early December, this will be my first ultra. I’m at about 30 miles and week and that will obviously increase over the coming months.

I’ve noticed that my calves and lower legs just hurt during the first few miles of my runs. It feels like structural pain as opposed to the usual, healthy pain, if that makes sense. My thought is that there are two issues causing it; 1) poor warmups and 2) my pace and running form, as I usually try to hit 180BPM and mid foot strike for 3-4 miles before I get a little tired and start opening my stride up more. Which leads me to two questions;

1) what warm ups routines do you all follow? 

2) how can I mitigate the impact pain associated with shorter strides? I’m 6’2” and feel that I’m decreasing my stride lengths to achieve a mid foot strike and go for that 180BPM goal I keep hearing about. Sub question; should I just go for the longer stride? 

Very much appreciate any advice you guys have! And thank you for the information I’ve gleaned from here so far!",1614822695

Ultramarathon,Maximum-Swing-4983,Shortest Runs in Training for an Ultra,"I’ve been trying to put together a training plan for a 50k race by looking at a bunch of ready made ones and I noticed that most plans for ultramarathons still include short 5km (3mi) runs or 35-50 minute easy runs. 

In the past, my shortest runs have never been less than 7-10km (thats 4-6mi) and so it surprised me to see so many of these shorter runs. 

My question is: Ultramarathon and marathon runners, what is the shortest distance (or time) that you typically run in a day? When you run your shortest runs, do you run them as tempo, pace, intervals, hills, or anything special or just keep them as easy runs? 

Is there much benefit to keeping these shorter runs in a training plan? 

Thanks guys!",1614197953
Ultramarathon,frecklezs,"Any experiences with high blood pressure, electrolytes, and running?","I'm young, relatively fit, and have genetically high blood pressure that I work to control so that I don't have to take medication. This means that I restrict the salt in my diet to under 1,500 mg each day. Running is likely helping me keep my BP down too, but I've been running longer than I've been watching my BP, so I'm honestly not sure.


I have gotten into a comfortable rhythm putting miles on my legs, but I'm worried about nutrition on back-to-back (-to-back) weekend long runs on Friday, Saturday, Sunday as I amp up my training for my first 50 miler. I can be flexible with my electrolytes on race day, but I can't do that 3/7 days a week for months.


I currently limit myself to one honey stinger gel between miles 8 and 12, and drink maybe 32 oz of green tea or diluted juice during my runs (up to ~16 miles). It's winter so I can get away with using less atm, but I'll need more as it starts to get warmer and as I increase my distance.


I know that people here (and runners generally) are fit and may not have to worry about HBP, but does anyone have advice or tips on managing electrolytes with high blood pressure? Juice or snack or gel recommendations? Research that will make me worry less? Stories of your personal experiences? 


I wish/hope that my body would use the electrolytes I consume appropriately as I run, but I obviously can't trust my body to do what it's supposed to, or else I wouldn't have HBP in the first place. 


My kidneys and liver thank you in advance. ♥️",1614188277
Ultramarathon,RittyRats,"First ultra, looking for footwear advice/input!","I'm signed up to run my first ultra in May, a 55k with 3600ft of ascent. It's a mix of intermediate terrain covering grass, narrow trails, country roads and some coastal paths/beach.

I'm looking for advice on shoes as I'm not super happy with my current options and want to try picking up a new pair (or two, if reasonably priced) to see me through the distance. I have two main trail shoes currently, Altra Lonepeak 4.5 and Hoka Speedgoat 4

I love the grip and the underfoot protection on the Speedgoat but I find them incredibly tight in the forefoot and it really hampers my confidence in the distance. I cut a planned long run short at 25km because of discomfort and numbness and that's the furthest I've taken them. They are also super heavy and maybe overkill for the conditions I'm expecting (adore them for uphill mud sprints tho!)

The Altra are an absolute delight in terms of comfort, especially the forefoot. They have reasonable grip and I have very comfortably taken them to 35km when doing distance hill climbs. My only concern with the much lighter altras is they lack the shock absorption I crave as a heavier runner and I'm worried I'll really feel that going the distance. It could be the more minimalist design or the zero drop but generally I find them to be a slower more relaxed shoe and my go-to for recovery runs and not racing.

I'm hoping some experts here could point me in the direction of a new set of shoes to look into, brands to consider or share their own personal favourites for putting in the miles! I ideally want to buy sooner rather than later to rotate into training and get the confidence before the big day.

Many thanks and any clarification just ask :)",1614175472

I've been experiencing Patellar Tendinitis for about 5/6 months now. I've ran on and off (mostly trail runs) for the past 1.5 years but massively increased my training from Sept '20 onwards and most of it was road running. I started to feel knee pain and eventually went to a physio who told me to do a few things to strengthen my quads and glutes, he said to keep running. 

I then did a silly thing and ran the Yorkshire 3 peaks (40k) and afterward, my knee was fried. 

I didn't run again for weeks to let it heal and went to a physio who basically said id overdone it too quickly. 

I've been doing eccentric decline squats, progressing from two legs, to one leg, and now adding weight). 

I've been doing this religiously but I feel like I'm not making any progress. Most of the time when I perform the exercises it hurts, I get the odd day when it doesn't. The physio said to slowly start to run again as in for 5 mins, then 10, then 15.. which I did, but it got too sore again so I just stopped and decided I wanted to fully heal before I try and run again.

Obviously, I'm itching to get back to running BUT i want to heal.

I've been doing these squats for probably about 9 weeks now and I'm starting to feel a little deflated.

Has anyone else found anything else that works for them?

Willing to try anything at this point!

Ultramarathon,Sotnem,Timing of strength routine into weekly training,"Any thoughts on when best to insert a strength training routine during weekly training. I gather it is best to include this on a hard day, but which one?


My initial thought is to include this on my early week high intensity hill sprint day (~100-300m sprints 5-8x @ b/t 5-10% grade, ~5 miles total distance w/ warmup+cooldown), and make this a ""total strength day"". If you agree, do you think it is best to do strength exercises (eg single leg squats, planks, russian twists, hip routine) before or after the hill sprints?


Doing them before would maximize absolute strength gains, but limit my sprint capacity. Im training for a 100 mile w/ 22K gain, and wondering which of the two is more important here? I find the sprints have helped my running economy a ton, and I already have good baseline strength (but more's always better!?).",1614091337

I'd estimate the Hokas have almost 300mi in them while the Altras have maybe 200mi. The Hokas have better cushioning but the Altras have better traction and my big toes appreciate the wider toe box. Not sure which I'll prefer race day.

I’m new to ultra running - my longest run is a trail marathon last December.  (I’ve don’t bits of jogging for years, as well as hiking and cycling). 

but I’m building up my base. I’m training using a mix of trail running and hiking (hilly and muddy - I keep my HR up hiking, roughly following Galloway). Long runs are up to around 20-25km with a 10-20km hike the day after. Weekly mileage around 30km running and 20km walking. 

But I’m doing 90% of this off road (which has really slowed me down, especially as we’re swimming in mud in the UK at the moment - I’m spending a nice amount of time sliding up and down hills or down the edges of fields!)

Anyhoo. I’m booked into Run to the Sea Bournemouth 5th June (50km) and Race to the Stones in July (100km). I’ve just looked at the course for Bournemouth and I’m worried I’m not prepared: 

1) Bournemouth says to wear road shoes, and that it’s mostly on paths. How should I be preparing my body for that? I know it’s hard going from road to trail, but is there anything to look out for going the other way? Should I do more road running? 

2) shoes, I have one pair of road shoes which are slightly too narrow. So will need to find some I like. What should I look for for this distance? Extra soft? I like less shoe for off road (currently using my inov8 mudclaws mostly, I also have the parkclaws) any thoughts 

I’m probably over thinking this - but I’ve found it a lot easier to up my mileage off-road without injury, and don’t know how much that will transfer back to road once I’ve built up!",1613469482

Ultramarathon,trail-pact,First 50K End of April. Injury stress,"Hi runners,

I’m looking for some guidance. 
• I’ve been a casual runner for the past 5 years. 
• Last May I ran my first HM. During last years training that got worked down to sub 2. 
• Over the summer I ran the virtual race across Tennessee. 
• This past winter I started a Sage plan for my first 50K, slotted for April 24th.

~ week 7 I got injured during an interval workout. This was on Jan 20th. Haven’t had any meaningful weekly mileage since then. My base at that point was probably ~35MPW. I was doing really well on that plan, but I lost sight of being careful and I believe speedwork + uncharted mileage got me. I’ve taken a week or two off, tried to run but it wasn’t going. Decided to go to PT.

I have what my PT evaluated as posterior tibial tendonitis. Have been doing all the exercises but he said I need to ease back into running.
My altered plan (removing speedwork) looks as follows:

*Note I have a week buffer now to ease into week 1

Week 1: 13M (5/3 weekend)
Week 2: 22M (6/4 weekend)
Week 3: 29M (10/3 weekend)
Week 4: 37M (15/5 weekend)
Week 5: 41M (18/4 weekend)
Week 6: 47M (20/5 weekend)
Week 7: 39M (15/5 weekend)
Week 8: 38M (12/4 weekend) 
Week 9: Race week 

I’m nervous because my longest run so far was a 30k, so I wanted more of those before the race. I don’t mind hiking uphills or short stretches at a time but I don’t want to walk a 50K. Do you think my plan is reasonable or should I recoup, strength train and build back up over the summer for a fall race?",1613325506
Ultramarathon,kdogitydog,"Ran my first 50M yesterday at Rocky Raccoon in Huntsville, TX!","I have only attempted one other 50M, where I dropped at mile 16. I trained like crazy for this race and choose it, because it was closer to home, and there was a lower elevation profile. I had my taper doubts during the week, and was not sure how I would perform in the weather and with my crew bailing due to the weather. My original goal was under 10 hours, and then I changed it to under 12 hours. BUT, I ran a 9:10!

My legs felt strong the whole race - towards the end I could feel them getting tired, but I was able to hold my pace and just added some walking on the big uphills. I stopped being able to take in calories around mile 42 - I wasn't nauseous but nothing was appealing anymore, so I might have to play with my nutrition next time. I have some dietary restrictions, so I relied mostly on my drop bags. I also went through a lot of water (maybe too much?), and had to stop to pee maybe 4 times during the race. I did have some electrolyte mix in some of my fluids. 

But regardless, I am soooo happy I was able to finish and feel so good during my race! All the training pays off!!",1613319107
Ultramarathon,livingStory1,50K Recovery Questions,"Hi everyone, first time poster here! I was wondering how long after a 50K it was before I should expect to feel back to 100% and how long it has been in your experience?  Below are some details to help facilitate answers.    
Race: Mountain Mist 50K, it was my 2nd time running it and 3rd race I have ever run - a marathon being my 1st. I ran it in 6:24:59.

Effort: I had nothing left, I do not believe I could have physically done better.  

Training: I had a good start to my training and ramping up, averaging nearly 40 mile weeks. But a month before the race, life got in the way and I hardly ran at all.

After Race: I stretched, took some carbs and protein, epsom salt bath for the next few days.  Plenty of easy walks. I have started running a mile or two about 10 days after.  I am now two weeks out and running a 5K about 3 or 4 times a week, nice and slow.  But my legs feel tired and half a mile into the run and what felt effortless before, it now takes some effort to run that 5K at a 9 min pace.  Before the race 8 min pace was effortless.    


Is it normal to still feel off/not fully recovered 3 weeks out from a race (50K) that you gave 100% in?",1613241484
Ultramarathon,Arglebargle4321,Charity fundraising based on real-time mileage,"I was wondering if anyone knows of a website/app that lets you raise money for a charity and updates in real-time based on how many miles you've run. 

I've seen things where people pledge money for every mile you complete, and you then calculate what you raised at the end. I haven't seen anything where the total is updated in real-time based on your performance. I guess it would need to be linked to a Strava or Garmin feed.  Ideally, I'm looking for something where I am choosing the charity, as opposed to some websites that just raise money in general.   I feel like the technology is there, I just haven't seen anything that combines all the pieces. 

I would do love to do some longer local runs (50-100 miles) and use it as an opportunity to raise money for local charities. I think it would be great motivation to see the amount go up while I run, and hopefully also a fun thing for people to donate to instead of just clicking send on Venmo. 

Any suggestions much appreciated!",1613160011

I’ve been competing since I was a kid but the majority of my races have been 5ks and my average long run is only about 11 miles.

Ultramarathon,DaisyCutter44,first 100k - training advice,"Hi everyone, I decided (mostly as a bet lol) to sign up for a 100k in 15 weeks (end of May). I have been scouting around for training plans and everyone seems to have a different idea, from the crazy people doing insane doubles at the weekend to Camille Herron, so I a interested to hear about different approaches.

As a background, I'm not a great runner, mid-36 10k and 2h55 marathon PB (to be fair on a horrible day on a horrible course, I could easily have run 2h51 in a normal race), but I ran almost 5000k in 2020 and averaging around 4000km/yr in the last 5 yr, so I can take a bit of volume (if I do it properly, as I'm a bit prone to overtraining). 

Also interested to hear if there's anyone on similar times to get an idea on what I can do. Obviously the goal is just to finish it, but I also don't want to leave too much time on the table if I can avoid it. I was thinking that 11-12 hrs could, on an ideal day, be achievable (wolfgang's plan says under 11hrs with a 3h29'-thon, but that seems overly optimistic to me)",1613128449

Ultramarathon,TheMountainRunner,Back to back ultra distance runs and heart recovery,"Hi all, I hope this is the right place to ask this question. I usually spend 7-8 months out of the year training for high alpine mountain running in the Summer months. However, during those summer months, I am usually running ultra distances weekly with almost no time to do any proper training in-between except for very light recovery runs. 

I am curious about the effects on the heart that this may have. Does the heart require more time than 1-2 weeks to properly recover? There may be one or two days directly after a run where I will get heart palpitations but after that I'm fine. 

I ask because I've heard of long term damage to the heart while doing this. I am also doing a long distance bike packing trip right after a 100k but the person I'm going with wants me to wait a few weeks until after the race to start because they think the heart needs to recover. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, and if you have any links to scientific papers that may have studied this topic, I would appreciate it even more!

Ultramarathon,Electrical-Pickle396,50k goal time and pacing strategy advice,"Hi everyone, I was hoping some more experienced runners could give me some advice on setting a goal time for a 50k and pacing strategy.

For background, I started running back in May 2020 where I slowly built up my miles(first time ever running longer distances so it was slow). Fast forward to October of 2020, I found out there was an opening to a 50k right near me the day before the event. I decided to go for it. My longest run at the time was a 16 miler I did the week before and I peaked at 25ish miles a week. In the race itself, I was overly optimistic and ran about 9:20 pace for about 18 miles then obviously crashed. I had zero nutrition besides a 32oz gatorade. Clearly wasn't 'ready' but I'm grateful for the experience and really respect the distance. Ended up finishing in 5:45.

I am going to be running the same 50k in March 2021. I am now 7 weeks out and my miles are currently at 50 per week and i'm planning to peak at 56mpw and a 26 mile run 3 weeks out before I taper. With this, I feel like I should be able to run sub 5 hours being more prepared this time but I want to know everyone's thoughts. I want to push myself to the limit but I also don't want to crash with 5 miles left. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1612461013

Running last week was seriously interrupted by a dime/nickel sized removal of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from my upper forehead right by the usual hairline. I still have all my hair :). 

Cause--not wearing suncreen in my youth (aahhh, the 1970s, when smoking was unfortunately rampant and riding carefree in the back of a station en route to full fat ice cream was great fun). I previously had a BCC patch removed from my back neck/shoulder area right above the (running) shirt line. I've worn sunscreen for decades (and worn a hat for most of that time) but it takes decades to develop. Running all these miles, exposed to the sun, puts us at greater risk for sun damage and BCC.

Things happen as we get older, which includes various maladies. This is one of them but mostly easily preventable. [People of all colors can get BCC](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html)

I'll be fine as BCC is generally easily curable by the removal of the BCC area, but the discomfort and need to heal without pain, and without bleeding through the stitches to reduce scarring, meant complying with medical advice not to run last week and most of this week. BCC is the ""best version"" of skin cancer to get, but [there's worse like squamous cell and melanomas](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer.html).

The first BCC was found via a skin check by a dermatologist, which was generally recommended by my internist based on age. I had a list of areas of concern I brought to the doctor. Each of those weren't in fact anything. But the dermatologist said this patch right here on your neck/back, that's where I’m concerned. I said that's nothing, just some redness and I probably just irritated my skin with something. Obviously I was wrong and the doctor was correct--it was BCC. 
I would have NEVER thought to go to the doctor if I had saw that red patch on me or anyone else. Get regular skin checks.
The second one was noticeably strange, but then I didn't go to the dermatologist because of Covid. Then I did and it was BCC as I suspected.

So wear sunscreen now to avoid sun damage and making this post yourself decades from now. And, for long runs, I generally wear what I call a [French Foreign Legion hat](https://www.runningwarehouse.com/Headsweats_Protech_Hat/descpage-HPH.html) that you can get from anywhere (the link is just one example) because your neck and shoulders are also exposed.

Plus, you'll look fabulous from the absence of sun damage (though despite my middle aged but youthful looking appearance from decades of wearing sunscreen, I still got BCC).",1611011497

The track is completely non technical, it's essentially a road run. It is approx 3.75km so will be approx 26 laps. The most challenging part is one steep hill which is a 5% inline 440m in length.

1. Reading elevation stats doesn't really mean a lot to us. Is this elevation difficult? Most of my runs I do now wouldn't even break 300m of total elevation.

Telford ran from Anchorage, Alaska, across Canada, to Nova Scotia, 5,110 miles in 106 days. Jones swam 700 miles down the Mississippi River. The public thought they were the greatest of that era because of clever self-promotion efforts. But where do these two actually fit in with the best 100-mile ultrarunners of that time?

Ultramarathon,Humble_Duck,Does Heavy Elevation work lead to better results?,"Hey Everyone!

I have recently gotten into running this year and quickly discovered that trail running was a perfect Ven Diagram for my interests in Running and Hiking/Nature. It is so much more interesting to me than road running so I have quickly gravitated to it. My main question is this: I would love to do a longer trail race in the future (25k or even eventually a 50k) but I have trouble getting to longer distances on the trails I run. I know a huge part of trail running is dealing with elevation so that has been something I have attempted to tackle head on to make sure I build that base. I run trails relatively consistently and hit anywhere from 600-1000 feet elevation gain on runs ranging from 4-8 miles. If I keep this up will it eventually get to a point where I can string together longer trail runs without getting worn out or is there a different approach I should be taking? 

Thanks for any advice that can be provided!",1608171996

I have a 50k coming up this weekend. Training had been going well and injury free up until my longest run 2 weeks ago, a 23 miler. The run itself went fine, but the next day I woke up with some pretty intense generalized pain in my right foot. 

I waited for the pain to go away by resting, icing etc but a week and a half later it was still there, even just when I walked. I tried a very slow 2 mile run to test it and it felt pretty ok while running but the pain increased after so I went to a podiatrist the next day. 

X-ray and touching my feet had her rule out a stress fracture and she gave me a steroid injection, which did not help at all. 

Yesterday I ran an easy 10 miles to see what would happen. Again, the run was actually mostly pain free but after I drove home and got out of my car it had me limping. 

So... should i go try to do this 50k and then deal with whatever is going on it my foot after? Or should I drop this race and deal with whatever is going on with my foot right now and hope for a race when I’m all the way healthy?

*His mind began to tell him that he had nothing left to give. In reality, he believes he was around sixty percent away from having given everything. This understanding led him to develop a forty percent rule in which you acknowledge that your mind will start telling you that you’ve reached the end of your capabilities but if you push through this initial pain you can start tapping into another sixty percent of what is possible.*

*As David continued into the race he overcame many mental barriers and battled with the constant opportunity to give up. When the pain was at his worst he gave himself small milestones he had to complete before he’d let himself quit. As he reached these milestones he’d have built the confidence to set another. Breaking the mental down into these small tasks he was able to find a way to continue.*

*He took eight hours to walk every step of his fifth and final lap, but he finished the race in a total of thirty three hours and twenty three minutes. Coming in at ninth place and one of only twenty three athletes who completed the ultra marathon.*

This segment was taken from my summary of his book, 'Can't Hurt Me' which you can read here [https://knowledgeforyourporridge.com/david-goggins-you-cant-hurt-me/](https://knowledgeforyourporridge.com/david-goggins-you-cant-hurt-me/)

Ultramarathon,biomed-engineer,Hoping for some feedback on a wearable hydration monitor I am developing,"I am working on a smart garment (think compression shorts, compression underwear, or leggings) that can continuously and noninvasively monitor the hydration status of the wearer. The form factor is essentially the same as a normal garment. You just slip on the garment and go. The device measures the body's fluid levels and analyzes the amount of intracellular and extracellular fluid to make inferences on how hydrated an individual is. This information can be used to create personal hydration confidence intervals, has a strong scientific foundation, and has been shown to strongly correlate to race performance in high endurance athletes (happy to share more information on these points).

I would really appreciate your feedback on what we are creating. The goal is to offer a few data points relating to hydration: some hydration score that shows you your general hydration baseline, how your score compares to other athletes of your caliber, and color-coded actions. Green= you are well hydrated, yellow= you are trending towards dehydration, and red= you are dehydrated.

We are also developing a few other measurements to go along with the hydration monitor:

1. Continuous ECG heart rate monitoring (no strap or external device required)
2. Continuous velocity measurements
3. Total power output (joules or Calories)
4. Average stride (feet or meters / step)
5. Total distance (km or miles)
6. Performance management scores (think Training Peak's TSS, ATL, CTL and TSB)

How useful would such a device be to you? Any suggestions on how we could make this better?

If you would be interested in beta testing the device, we would really appreciate it if you signed up [here](https://us19.list-manage.com/survey?u=66dcc699f56b64c4c8e48dbf1&amp;id=738ddff191).",1606918831

Ultramarathon,pierredelecta,Advice to your younger self (but also to me)?,"Hey, all.

I'd really appreciate hearing from experienced long-distance runners (especially folks over 40 or 50) on what advice you'd give your younger self. Could be good health habits to adopt, lifestyle changes you wish you'd made sooner, or any wisdom you can offer on developing the emotional grit that ultras demand.

For context:
I just turned 23, am a somewhat-novice runner, and decided recently that I want to run an ultramarathon (when the time is right and I've put in the necessary work, of course).

I've been training 6 days/week for almost 2 months, and am really noticing how much my body's aged since I ran recreationally when I was younger. They were damn nice while they lasted, but my days of casual 5-mile runs hungover, underslept, without stretching, etc., are definitely over. I'm learning to be more disciplined and take better care of myself so that I can work toward longer-term goals (specifically, a few sub-4 marathons and, god help me, just one good ultra before I die) and enjoy a lifetime of running. 
Sometimes it's obvious what I need to do (I'm quitting cigarettes and alcohol, have a great diet, cross-train, resting plenty), but I don't doubt that one day I'll look back and have the wisdom to know what I still could have done better for myself.

Am also brand new to Reddit, so any page recommendations are appreciated!",1606836697

(How do I learn to trail run on rocks when I don't have that on my local trails),"Aside from running more trails with rocks ( had to get that one out of the way). I ran about 13ish miles in the Appalachian trail in Maryland this past weekend from South Mountain to Weaverton it was covered in leaves and very full of rocks(big, small, medium, some loose, some stable). There were half mile sections were the trail was nothing but rocks. I've never experienced terrain like that before plus it was covered in leaves.
Next time I run that part of the Appalachian trail I want to run it much much faster.

I live in Columbia,Md about 1 hour away. Most of the trails I run have roots and small rocks so I was not accustom to that  terrain. I'm willing to drive there maybe once every couple months but that's about it.

In 1974, the most famous story in American ultrarunning took place, when **Gordy Ainsleigh** ran on the Western States Trail, in the California Sierra, during a 100-mile horse race, **without** his horse. At first, his run went unnoticed, until several years later when it became the icon for the newly established Western States 100 and for mountain trail 100-milers in general. He has given himself the credit for inventing ultrarunning.

In this episode of the Ultrarunning History Podcast, the place in history for his run is examined, and put in its proper historic context. Yes, you were told he was the first to cover Western States on foot, but he was actually the 8th, and the sport of trail ultrarunning was not invented that year.

Also, 53 other people covered the Western States Trail on foot about a week after Gordy’s famed 1974 run. This forgotten tale is also told.

Ultramarathon,spaceecake,People who feel inspired to run an ultra read this.,"So I've been seeing a LOT of fairly inexperienced runners posting questions if it's possible to run an ultra in x amount of months. The general advice of the sub is pretty much always ""maybe, but not recommended"".
But let me share my running progression to give you an idea what it takes to succesfully, without serious injuries build to 100mi distance.

I knew I wanted to run an ultra ever since my first marathon in 2018, after watching billy yang's utmb CCC video. So I signed up for another marathon, and then another and about a year later, my first 50 miler. Even a year after my first marathon of very consistent training I still didn't manage to run the whole thing without walking some parts and even picked up a light knee injury.

Then it took me another year to succesfully run 100km with 2k+ elevation This time without getting injured.

And i'm on my way for another year of slowly building extra base to get the running 100miles.

That's two years of slow progression in order to complete these distances in a decent time and without serious injuries.

The baseline: It takes a shitload of time and experience for your knees and feet to get used to the weekly miles and the event itself. In addition the time commitment is not something to shrug off or to just wing it. In your training for a 100km/100mile distance it possible you will be running most of your weekend. 

Ofcourse everyone is different and some people are very injury resistant and can definitely handle a sharp ramp up in training or even handle the distance without much training at all. But that will be a VERY small percentage of this subreddit.

Tldr: respect the distance. Don't be a danger to yourself or your race organiser.",1606232426

Ultramarathon,fishburnPayne,Going from a marathon on Dec. 13 to a 50 miler on April 3. Is this a terrible idea?,"Hey guys,

A little background:

23 year old male. Houston, TX. I’ve been running pretty consistently for about 5 months now. Previously, I’ve done a good bit of strength/cardio/sports. 

Started off doing easy 3-4 mile runs and realized that I really enjoy running. 

Had a a good bit of beer one night and signed up for a marathon. I’m now in the thick of marathon training (got my 20-miler tomorrow), and my marathon is on Dec 13 (solo marathon; the one I signed up for got cancelled). My body feels really good so far, and I’m loving these long runs. Only hiccup I’ve had in training was a small case of Achilles bursitis in my right Achilles. I implemented a stretching routine and thankfully the pain is completely gone, even on my longer runs. 

I’ve been at about 30-40 now for the past month or so. 

So, I’m thinking about doing the Brazos Bend 50 in early April. It’s a super flat course and it sounds like a lot of fun. And no, I’m not drunk this time. 

I’ve stocked up on a couple ultra-running books: Hal Koerner’s “Field Guide to Ultrarunning” and Jason Koop’s “Training Essentials for Ultrarunning.” I’m gonna get educated on the do’s and dont’s before I start training. 

The question I have for you guys is: Is this type of schedule, between a first marathon and a 50-miler, something you guys would advise?

Ultramarathon,_AproposOfTheWetSnow,[Speculation] Colorado's newest 100k?,"A friend of mine posted the following article to LinkedIn earlier today:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/suziedundas/2020/11/18/colorados-new-palisade-plunge-a-32-mile-biking-and-hiking-trail-with-a-6000-foot-descent/?sh=3d64a1ae4287](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suziedundas/2020/11/18/colorados-new-palisade-plunge-a-32-mile-biking-and-hiking-trail-with-a-6000-foot-descent/?sh=3d64a1ae4287)

From the article:

&gt;Colorado’s new “[Palisade Plunge](https://www.copmoba.org/power-the-plunge/)” hiking and mountain biking trail gets its name from the trail’s 6,000 foot descent over 32 miles.  
&gt;  
&gt;Technically passable now but officially planning to open in late spring of 2021, the Plunge was developed by area recreation and bike groups. The trail was almost 10 years in the making with the total cost to build expected to come in around $3.4 million. Much of that came from community and state grants that recognized the potential economic boost the Plunge could bring to area communities via bike rentals, shuttle fees, hotel stays, and overall increased visits from the mountain bike community. 

As a local to the Grand Valley, I'm not surprised that this trail is being marketed specifically to mountain bikers, but my first thought was that this would make a pretty incredibly out-and-back 100k. Climbing from the high-desert biome of Palisade to the alpine biome of the Grand Mesa (most notable for being the [world's largest flattop mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mesa#Climate)) would make for some beautiful terrain. Additionally, Palisade is one of two American Viticulture Areas in the state, so I would hope that the race might attract sponsorship from one (or several) of the 30+ wineries in the region. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that an opportunistic race director will see the promise of this trail and create an epic race.

Approximate trail stats:  


* \~65 miles (out-and-back)
* \~9,600 feet gross elevation gain (out-and-back)
* \~4,700 feet minimum elevation
* \~10,700 feet maximum elevation

More details available [here](https://www.copmoba.org/power-the-plunge/#1554917752751-84cde7d3-e930) (including a map) for those interested. I also created a loose course map in CalTopo, available [here](https://imgur.com/a/AzIJqpU).

Ultramarathon,75North_,Morning Musing,"Awaking to the sharp, sudden noise of falling raindrops on the cap of my pick up truck, I roll over, stretch my arms out of my cozy sleeping bag and the cold air pierces my comfort.  I had worked late last night, some walk-ins had showed up last minute and still being an apprentice, both needing the money and to pay my dues to the shop, I stayed late to tattoo them. Then, I had driven here, to a rural parking lot just outside of the trail. I inflated my slightly less than full size mattress, placed it on the plywood topper I built to store all of my outdoor gear, crawled into my sleeping bag and fell asleep.

I could just go back to sleep. Hell, I could drive home and go to sleep in an actual bed heated by a furnace. All of this is voluntary. These thoughts are interrupted by my remembering that if I wanted to stay comfortable and not push myself, I’d sign up and complete (not competitively) my local 5k. 

Pulling my body fully out of my sleeping bag I completely undress in the cold, the sharp rain hitting my tattooed skin.

Some background info - I'm 28, 94kg, athletic-ish build, never ran properly until March this year when our gyms shut down.

After completing the C25K plan I realised I was quite enjoying running, so then I did a 10km and then realised I could probably manage a marathon with a bit of extra training.

Few weeks later I get the bright idea to do a 50km run for a charity that's personal to me as a way of keeping me focused and accountable with my running throughout lockdown.

I've had zero niggles or injuries and steadily improved hitting a 30km run a few weeks back.

I'm now 1 week and 2 days away from the big run and my past 2 runs I've been unable to get more than 15 minutes in before my ankle and lower calf feel like they're on fire.

At this point I'm comfortable the work has been done for the 50km but as a novice I'm unsure if I should just take the next 9 days off completely and focus on rolling/stretching my calf or it I should still be trying to run whilst also upping my prehab/rehab stuff.

I think part of what caused this was a rather large jump in volume from a 50km week to 2 70km and an 80km week, but I'm also not 100% sure as this pain started after a gym session and as my running volume started to taper down.

Any advice on what I can or should do to ensure I can complete the 50km would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",1605216319
Ultramarathon,jackkuenzle,Recording an activity beyond the battery life of your watch?,"Hey guys. Sorry if this has been addressed in the past, but I’m looking to attempt the Lowest to Highest route (130 miles, 30k ft climbing) FKT and would like to record it on my Garmin Fenix 5X. I can get 13-15 hours out of my watch and I estimate L2H will take 30-40 hours. What do you guys recommend as far as recording the entire activity? 


I will be carrying a battery pack to charge my phone, I feel I could just charge my watch while using it but I’ve never tried that. I’d hate to lose the effort to some glitch. I’m also considering UltraTrac mode on the watch but I’ve heard that’s super inaccurate.

Ultramarathon,Bards-EyeView,Scaling down an ultra training plan to specific goal mileage,"Howdy, I'm new to posting here. I'm going to start training in a few weeks for my first ultra attempt. I wanted some sort of template to work off of, even if I end up modifying it, so I found [this 16 week training plan from Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/ultra/a774983/16-week-50-mile-ultra-marathon-training-schedule/). (For all I know, this plan is well-known in the community or, alternatively, not well-known or even infamous. I don't know how people feel, so any thoughts about the plan, especially from someone who's attempted it, would be helpful.)

My biggest question is this: Since I'm going to run 40 miles, and not 50 miles as the plan dictates, how should I modify it? My inclination is to slash all the duration and distance by 20% and be done with it. However, this could be shortsighted. Maybe I should only cut the long runs, or long runs plus any runs over an hour but not under and hour, or some complicated set of criteria. I know that a lot of it will depend on how things will develop as I train, but I was hoping someone here could give me some good first principles to work from when modifying a plan for shorter distance. Any thoughts in general on training for a first ultra would be super helpful too. Thanks in advance!",1604947780
Ultramarathon,dschlais,Question about shoes for training -,"Hey squad, new here and registered for my first ultra at the end of may! 

In prep I am going to be following a protocol that I am excited about. Most of my training miles until closers to the event are going to be a mix of trail running on the weekends and running the Scottsdale canal during the week when i can't drive across town to the trails. 

I have about 1 mile to run on the sidewalk to get to the canal which is mostly hard packed dirt and a bit of pavement.

I completed my first 50k (2100m elevation) two days ago and I’m surprised with how well I feel. 

After a marathon I have saw legs for days. I didn’t do any specific training for the ultra and my longest run was about 21k in the lead up. At the same time I couldn’t have gone much faster on the day. The race involved walking up most hills. I finished in 6hr 30min

As I’m learning about ultras, I am wondering if the slow speed but tough course might be easier on body than a marathon at a fast pace (my marathon time is 2:44).

I am currently registered for my first 100-mile race in February 2021. Provided it is not canceled, I will be flying there as It is roughly 1900 miles away and do not want to do a solo road trip there and back. I already have my flights and hotel secured. Typically when I fly I prefer to only use carry-on luggage so I can make sure my bag is actually going to be there when I arrive and my essential/expensive stuff is not accidentally lost or damaged. I know it does not happen frequently but I always want to make sure important essential or expensive items are not at that risk. I have never had to fly to a race before however. 

When it comes to travelling with your running gear and your fuel for a race what do you do? I wont be able to have my Spring Energy gels in my carry-on bag here in the US since you cannot travel with food items. I do not believe that this type of energy gel would be allowed. I could check the luggage and risk possibly being lost. I could take my running fuel and any other extra running gear and have it shipped via UPS or FEDEX to the hotel I will be staying at. 

What have you all found works the best when dealing with Domestic flights to races that are outside comfort for driving there?

Ultramarathon,AnAverageHuman96,How do I start training for an Ultramarathon?,"Hey everyone I'm a 23 year old male looking to do an ultra in late 2021. I used to do soccer and track in high school, and at one point I was able to run a mile is 5:50, two miles in 12:30, and a 5k in 19:50 (time in minutes). I have started to work out frequently ever since COVID hit and I now run 3-4 days a week along with doing calestenics and weights built in Mon-Fri. I usually just take Sunday's off from any activity, but sometimes I do Saturday as well. Through all the working out since COVID I went from 200lbs down to 175-180lbs, where I've been staying steady.

Right now I can run one mile in just under 7mins, a 5k in 25:00, and a 10k in 1:02:00.

On Mondays I do HIIT for about 30 minutes where I do a 90% sprint for 20 seconds, and a slow jog for 40 seconds. Obviously I repeat this until I have 30 mins of HIIT, with some warm up and cool down time. After catching my breath from my Monday HIIT I usually do some ab work and pullups that afternoon. On Tusday's I do calestenics and weights. Wednesday's I do a just below race pace 5k, with abs and pullups in the afternoon. Thursday's I do calestenics and weights. Friday's I do a long slow run, typically 11min/mile pace and for 5-7 miles in length. Saturday's and Sunday's I usually rest, but I sometimes play disc golf or go hiking. 

I also want to see if anyone has any tips to prevent injury. Like how do you know where your body's limit is for mileage a week? The reason I ask is because I had to take 6 weeks off from running over the summer due to really bad IT band syndrome in both knees. I do think part of the issue was I went from not working out and running at all to 5-6 days of exercise per week. I am having sporadic issues with plantar fasciitis and IT band tightness, but nothing I can't handle. I stretch everyday.

I want to try a half marathon on my own and then sign up for an ""easier"" trial running ultra (~50k). 

I'm open to training ideas and other suggestions! Thanks!",1603852726

Ultramarathon,TheOfficialLostBard,Imagining Mountain Ultra Trail Running In The Olympics,"## Summary

*“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now.” - Chinese Proverb*

One day, 100 Mile Mountain Ultra Trail (MUT) Running will be an Olympic sport. 

This essay riffs on what it might look like to accomplish that within the next decade. 

Why should we go for it? Because the benefits of Olympic status are huge. 

* There is no bigger stage to demonstrate the sport to the world.
* A surge of interest and participation in the sport usually follows in the years to come.
* Access is granted to public and private funding for performance and research in the sport.
* Amateur and professional athletes in the sport realize more business opportunities.

If our goal is to grow the sport and create more opportunities for male and female athletes, coaches, race directors, and any other relevant parties, there isn’t a more noble pursuit than the campaign for Olympic status.

## The Scene

*“The way I attack the downhills... I will break your quads and you won’t be able to jog the flats anymore. Find your 2:05 guy, give me a couple hours in the canyon, I’ll be the first one out.” - Jim Walmsley*

Imagine this for a moment.

The year is 2034 and Salt Lake City, UT is hosting the Winter Olympics. 20 years earlier, a rule was instituted allowing the host city to trial a sport in the games. Recognized as the hub of American trail running, local officials have chosen to include the 100 Mile Mountain Ultra Trail Running event. The course, suitable for the winter conditions, is the Bonneville Shoreline - a trail weaving north-south along the foothills of the Wasatch.

16 hours into the men’s race, cameras converge on mile 94 where Jim Walmsley (USA, 44 years old), is being chased by Killian Jornet (Spain, 46 years old) on the muddy climb out of City Creek Canyon. Both are at the tail ends of illustrious careers. And both are anticipating a  “one and done” showing at the Olympics. Given how much the competition has improved in the last two decades, leading the race is a testament to the timelessness of their talents. 6 miles and 2,600 feet of elevation change separate them from the finish line. They are digging deep, implicitly understanding this moment to be the capstone of their careers.

The drones zero in.  Walmsley is breathing hard. Billows of white smoke cloud his face. Little has changed from the early days. He has charged from the gun. It’s anyone's guess whether he will make it to the finish line. 

Jornet confidently passes him near the top of the 3 mile climb. A scorecard on the left side of the screen shows biometric readings from the sensors on his gear. He has incurred significant muscular damage in his legs, but has clearly fueled well. His glycogen stores are in check and he is well hydrated. The announcers have patched in his coach who comments on the preparation Jornet has done in the months and years leading up to this moment - particularly the work on his mind. 

‍After a 60 second montage summarizing his training in the Grand Canyon, one of the drones moves closer to Walmsley so the announcers can ask for a comment. Walmsley waves it off. He has been an open book for most of the race, but won’t entertain the pundits at this time. The only thing that matters right now is keeping up with Jornet, who has already put a 30 second gap on him. 

‍The screen moves to the leaderboard and then pivots to another drone’s footage. Just 3 minutes and a quarter mile behind Walmsley and Jornet is a physically battered, but hard-charging Dylan Bowman (USA, 47 year old ). A veteran of photo finishes, he is mentally prepared to drain himself over this final rollercoaster 10k and add to the drama. A last-minute alternate addition to the American team, no one expected Bowman to be in contention this late in the race.

‍At the finish line, event organizers are ecstatically watching the theatrics play out on a jumbo screen. The race has stayed close and hard-fought from start to finish. The story lines have been compelling - particularly the ones for Bowman, Jornet, and Walmsley remaining competitive so late into their careers. And it’s all been amplified by the high-quality live data and footage, and commentary from coaches and sport personalities. Skeptics thought this would be boring. On the contrary, it has been thrilling, like a reality TV show.

## Why It Deserves Olympic Status

There are at least *5 reasons* why Mountain Ultra Trail (MUT) running deserves Olympic status and a trial run in the summer or winter games.

* MUT running is another opportunity to spotlight and champion the amateur sportsperson.
* MUT running permeates every human culture. It has ancestral roots.
* MUT running has the “cool” factor to help turn the younger generation on to the Olympic institution.
* MUT running builds on one of the original Olympic sports, cross-country.
* MUT running has doubled participation from 4M to 9M runners over the last 15 years

Furthermore, changes to the Olympic games menu are commonplace. The program only has 25 “core” sports. The rest are fighting for spots every 4 years. To facilitate new events, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) discontinues certain sports in order to admit new ones. And since 1980, over 100 events have been added.

## How To Achieve Olympic Status

The standard route is time and resource-intensive. It starts with IOC recognition, but then there is a high global participation bar, among other criteria to meet, and campaigning to IOC officials can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. New Olympic sports like climbing and surfing followed this route. It took multiple decades of advocacy and concerted effort by their respective leaders to secure inclusion.

The alternative route is for local organizing committees to push favored sports and introduce them in the years their countries host the games. This process was formalized in 2014 and Tokyo will be the first to take advantage of it in 2021.

I advocate for the latter route. Given the possibility that Salt Lake City will host the Winter Games in 2030 or 2034, we could mobilize enough resources and build a solid infrastructure to encourage the local organizing committee to trial it then. There is no tried and true playbook. We would be inventing it as we go.

## Envisioning Olympic Status

The biggest question mark here is the sport’s entertainment value to spectators. 

The race might not translate well on television, especially when runners are separated by huge margins on the course and the finish line is 14 to 24+ hours away. Likewise, the excitement and drama is usually very subtle (like reaching a key check point on the course) or drawn out (like when a runner gets passed late in the race after miles of pursuit). Given the enormous challenge to the human attention span, we should create a unique and entertaining experience. Here are some ideas to facilitate that.

**The course has to be spectacular, dynamic, and spectator-friendly.** 

* Lots of single-track, climbing, descending, and altitude.
* A point-to-point or loop style course.
* Key landmarks are easily accessible by fans, media, and support teams.

‍‍**The latest health, gear, and media technology needs to be utilized for up to the minute status updates for every runner.** 

* Drones and camera/mics attached to each runner will be used to capture the best footage and commentary straight from the runners to their coaches, competitors, crew, commentators, and themselves. 
* Shirts, packs, shorts, and shoes will relay biometric data to the audience showing the physical and emotional toll on each runner over the course of the race.

‍**The media coverage has to include next-level analysis and storytelling for fans to better identify, follow along, and root for the athletes.**

* With all the data and footage at their disposal, commentators would have compelling talking points to share with fans. They would also call in coaches, fellow athletes, legends of the sport, family, and others to share in the conversation.
* Multiple interviews would be conducted with each of the runners well-ahead of the race during key points of their training. Then played out during the race.  
Documentaries would be built around each of the runners, displaying their backgrounds, personalities, thoughts on the sport, key racing moments, where they see themselves going in the future of the sport, as well as their general hopes, dreams, and fears. These would also be played out in clips during the race too - similar to the format in LOST with flashbacks and flash forwards.

‍**The fan participation has to include next-level access and innovative formats.**

* Fans wanting to periodically check-in or catch up on what they missed in a frictionless way, would be sent text alerts updating them on major changes in the race. There would also be dedicated journalists for every runner posting text and video updates as often as possible on each of the social platforms. 
* Fans attending the race would be allowed to get on course, follow runners, cheer on runners and provide their own user-generated updates and opinions to the social platforms too in order to expand the reach of the media coverage.

## Some Work That Needs To Be Done

There are two big question marks here. 

***First, how do we convince more top runners to defect from the track and roads onto the trails?*** 

‍**Olympic Dreams?** In the short-term, one of the incentives will simply be the prospect of making an Olympic team. On the men’s side, there are a lot of 2:11 - 2:15 guys who will narrowly miss making it in the marathon, that might see mountain ultra trail running as another viable pathway. The same goes for women in the 2:28 - 2:32 range. 

‍**New Challenges?** That said, 100 mile mountain ultra trail marathons are not as straightforward a test of physiology as shorter events. As distances get longer, differences in other factors like mental toughness help separate the field. Jim Walmsley has gone on record saying that a 2:05 marathoner wouldn’t be able to keep pace with him in these types of races. So another incentive might be to prove the naysayers wrong and show that fast road runners can convert their talent in the mountains.

**More money?** Finally, more money is coming into the sport as the largest brands get involved and that will help raise the talent-level of the ranks. If you build it and put money on the table for more runners to go pro, they will likely come in, specialize, and create a whole new generation and caliber of top runners in the sport.

‍***Second, how do we funnel the sport’s top runners into as many of the same races as possible?*** 

‍**Competitive Depth?** The biggest competitive issue plaguing the sport right now is the spread of top athletes across too many events. Outside of notable races like Lake Sonoma, Western States, and UTMB, it is rare to see more than a handful of top men and women on the same start lines. There are many reasons for this. Some athletes prefer going after FKTs, others like to mix it up at different race distances, and those who are focused on going or staying pro (rightfully) see the biggest stage and best opportunity as being over in Europe for most or all of the year.

‍**American League?** One solution might be to create teams in major mountain hubs across the country and have them compete in the equivalent of “Major League Ultrarunning” here in the United States. It could be built on top of the existing Golden Ticket series for Western States. Over the course of, say, a 10 month period, members of these teams would line up for 6 or 7 golden ticket races. They would accumulate wins and losses and the season would culminate at Western States, which would act like the championship event. The hometown and team elements would encourage more athletes to stay home, compete here, and get on more start lines with all the best American runners.

Then, every 3rd or 4th year, Western States could double as the trials event for the Olympics. Like, the top 3 men and top 3 women finishers would represent the country in the next Olympic event.

I am just riffing here. But you get the idea. We need to increase the talent pool and get more competitors on the same start lines. This is just how I might do it.

## Conclusion

We are far away from being recognized and included as an Olympic sport. But we have to start somewhere. In the near term, a trial in the Salt Lake City games is our best shot. How cool would that be? The Wasatch on the world stage. Think about that for a moment.

In the long-term, we need to build a training center, expand research opportunities, support coaches, and build our stables of athletes. In the short term, there are a couple of low-hanging fruit opportunities we can address in the next few years.

* **Getting more younger athletes involved.** Here, I propose creating a feeder system from the college ranks - educating runners on the opportunities to pursue careers on the trails instead of the track. Their examples would inspire more people in that age bracket. 
* **Getting more female athletes involved**. Here, I propose simply featuring more women in the sport’s marketing. On the Olympic track, we have a responsibility here. Brands play a pivotal role too. This is a friendly call-out to Altra, Hoka One One, and Salomon among others. **‍**
* **Getting more countries involved.** Here, I propose adding more races in regions like South America and South Asia to influence and encourage the local populations to mobilize.
* **Getting the sport more professionalized in America.** Here, I propose the formation of a true professional league. As I mentioned previously, we could call it “Major League Ultra Running”. 

Let me know your thoughts in the comments. I really want feedback here to improve on the idea.

I ran my first 50k 1 week ago, I was able to hold an 11:00/ pace on a, what I thought non technical trail. I haven’t run an open race in a few years as I’ve been focused on middle distance triathlon. I feel real good after a week. I’ve run about 15 real easy miles this week, swam a lot and done some mobility work. I want to run a 10k in 2 weeks but am having a hard time judging whether I’ll be recovered enough to put in a decent effort.

I don’t want to waste energy testing myself before then since I know I’m fatigued, I’d rather use the time to recover and then run the 10k. I’ve never run a 50k but I’ve done the 70.3 distance, but felt completely different as my fitness was different. I was way more fit going into this 50k then I’ve ever been in my life. I feel so much better after this 50k then I have after any race.

#Adventure Report: Manitou's Revenge 100
Relentless. 

That's the one word that comes to mind when I think of the Manitou's Revenge 100 route.

Absolutely. Soul crushingly. Relentless.

That's how I would elaborate on that thought.

Let's back up a second for historical reasons. This adventure was painfully long, so it deserves a race report that is equally so.

I'm sorry in advance.

#The History of the Manitou's Revenge 100
The Manitou's Revenge 54 mile race is widely considered one of the toughest endurance events on the east coast. Known for its heart pounding climbs, quad burning descents, and hours between aid stations, it is a challenge only attempted by the hardiest of mountain athletes.

But before Manitou's Revenge was a 54 mile event, it was proposed as a 100 miler by the twisted mind of Charlie Gadol. It wasn't until he described the course to local runners that he was convinced to shorten it to its present day length to avoid killing his entrants.

Ever since hearing the origin story of this race, the idea of running the original 100 mile route has haunted me. But the thought of running past the finish line and missing the post race festivities on race day never sat right with me. With the official race canceled for 2020 due to Coronavirus, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally try my luck.

With the help of my Catskill guru Mike Siudy, I put together a route based on the original course. The concept we settled on was simple and elegant: run the full length of the Long Path through Catskill Park, from the northern border to the southern border (or ""blue line to blue line,"" as Mike puts it).

When we totaled up the numbers for the course, there was no question that it was a burly route: 93  miles, 25,000 feet of climbing, and nine high peaks (summits 3,500' or higher). And naturally it would include some classic Catskill terrain, notably most of the Escarpment Trail, eight miles of the Devil's Path, and the entire Wittenberg-Cornell-Slide traverse.

Shortly before the day of my run, I found out that a local runner named Tom DeHaan had run a similar route, which he called Wings of Manitou. His route covered all of the high peaks but left off the first mile and the last twelve miles of the Long Path. His time of 29:48 provided a good benchmark, and I hoped to cover his mileage plus the extra sections in less time. After some back of the napkin math, I decided that 25 hours might even be possible in good conditions.

Two Dopes on a Slope (Start to Mile 24)
I asked a handful of  my craziest friends to join me for this adventure, but only Devang Patel was stupid brave enough to accept the invitation. So off we went into the darkness at 4am on a humid Saturday in June. With social distancing in mind, we each had one person crewing for us. In my case, it was my infinitely patient wife Alex, and in Devang's case it was the legendary Grand Slammer Otto Lam. Alex and Otto would spend the weekend driving to strategic locations and often hiking up overgrown mountain trails to find us on the course.

The first few miles were totally new to me, and we took them very slowly in the dark. We summitted our first high peak - Windham - just as the sun was starting to peak out. We paused for a few pictures at the summit, sharing the view with Rocky the wonder pup pictured above. Not understanding social distancing, Rocky spent most of our two minutes together gnawing on my hands and elbows. I guess I was already working up a good salty sweat.

The weather was a mild 50ish degrees, but the forecast called for alternating periods of stifling humidity and thunderstorms. We did our best not to think about the conditions that awaited us, but inevitably the conversation drifted back to the weather whenever a new set of clouds drifted overhead. We knew we could be in for rough conditions if the rockiest sections of the course were wet.

About two hours in, we merged with mile 4 of the original Manitou's course, meaning that the additional mileage and elevation had added about an hour to our route. That was fine with me, but I had neglected to add that time onto the pace sheet that I gave our crew. Sorry about that, guys!

I've always been thankful that the climb up Blackhead comes early in Manitou's. With 1,071' of rocky climbing packed into just 0.81 miles of trail, it is one of the most difficult sections of the entire course. But doing it at mile nine meant that we got to enjoy the all-four-limbs scrambling like a couple of kids playing on a jungle gym.

We reached our crew for the first time at Dutcher's Notch, running an hour behind our goal splits thanks to me being bad at math, but otherwise feeling good and moving well.

We cruised up Stoppel Point and had an easy meandering descent to North Point, where I lost the trail for a moment on the rocky slabs and Devang got us back on track. I'm pretty sure I make the same mistake every time I run Manitou's and I'm always lucky enough to have another runner correct me.

As we passed over Newman's Ledge I told Devang the story of the Escarpment trail runner who absentmindedly ran straight off a ledge and landed in the bushes 50 feet below. He thankfully survived but became a cautionary tale for future Catskill runners. The inaugural member of the Escarpment diving team.

""I mean, I wouldn't even want to fall off one of these little ledges,"" I added as we descended toward North-South Lake. ""You wouldn't die, but you could definitely *oof*!""

I had fallen off a ledge.

Thankfully it was a short ledge with dirt at the bottom, so I only bruised my ego. The timing could not have been more perfect though.

Anyway, we made it to North-South Lake in one piece, having covered the Escarpment Trail Race route in 5:16 (incidentally we would have placed 164th if it had been race day). We then had a short climb to South Mountain and a long runnable descent to Palenville. It was on this descent that the rain first started, just a drizzle at first but then a steady downpour.

#The Hard Part (Miles 24-56)
The thing about the Manitou's Revenge 54 course is that each section gets progressively harder. The Escarpment Trail is just a warm up for the long wet climb up Kaaterskill High Peak, which itself is just an easy hike compared the the Devil's Path. Now with an additional 40 miles tacked onto the end, we knew we had to not just survive this section but to make it to the end intact enough to tackle the sections beyond.

The rain proved to be a mixed blessing since it provided some much needed relief from the usual heat on the climb up Kaaterskill. We made steady work of the ascent, trying to motivate each other despite the increasingly muddy trails. The Snowmobile Trail that skirts the summit was, as usual, a sloppy mess. Even in the best of weather that trail has been known to steal the shoes right off a runner's feet.

The rain grew more intense and the air cooler as we climbed. I was comfortable while we were moving, but I was starting to get concerned about the risk of hypothermia later on. After topping out, we made quick work of the 1,000' descent and rolled into Platte Clove with a sense of urgency.

I took a few minutes to refuel and put on a rain jacket, but I opted not to change my socks since the next section was guaranteed to soak us anyway. I was back on the trail in less than five minutes, and Devang was shortly behind me.

Now it was time for the infamous Devil's Path section, known as one of the most strenuous sections of trail in the country.

With food in our bellies and some warmer layers on, our spirits were starting to recover. We made the summit of Indian Head in just over an hour. The descent to Jimmy Dolan Notch was treacherously wet, but thankfully the sticky rubber soles of my new Speedgoats worked like a charm.

The rain settled a bit and turned into more of a mist as we progressed across Twin and Sugarloaf, but the trails would stay wet for the remainder of the weekend. After a hair raising descent into Mink Hollow (-1,149' in 0.79 mi) we had warmed up enough that we could take off our rain jackets for the ascent of Plateau, which is the mirror opposite climb (+1,112' in 0.79 mi). Normally this is the last uphill scramble of the race and it turns into a heart pounding affair, but today it was time to settle in and conserve some energy. My 43min/mi pace on this section reflects, I will argue, my amazing patience rather than a total lack of climbing ability. Sigh...

Anyway, the top of Plateau offers some decent running for a few minutes before turning sharply downhill toward Warner Creek. We met up with mountain badasses Aaron Stredny and Shamus Nugent who were running the 54 mile course self supported. We spent a talkative few miles together, all of us happy to have more company during a long stretch between aid. We then added a fifth member to our party, whose name I didn't quite catch. Here's a video of him though [video in blog].

We refueled at Silver Hollow Notch and smooched up our crew members (or at least I did; I didn't keep tabs on Devang and Otto), and then it was time for the last two climbs and descents before Phoenicia.

We all got split up on the climb and descent to Warner Creek, and for the first time all day I found myself alone and able to take the climb up Mount Tremper at my own pace. And with 40 miles left to go, I was in absolutely no rush.

After some uninspiring 25 minute uphill miles, I met Mike Siudy at the summit where he offered an assortment of beverages. Then it was time for some equally uninspiring 15 minute downhill miles in the fog as the sun set and my headlamp batteries died. Not cool, headlamp, not cool.

I survived the descent intact, but I was becoming increasingly aware that my feet were waterlogged after being soaked most of the day. I trotted into Phoenicia at a leisurely pace and arrived at the Parish Hall with 17:39 elapsed. Accounting for the extra hour long climb up Windham High Peak, that's a 16:39 Manitou's Revenge 54 finish, which was just about on our target pace and would have placed us 57th of 113 starters in the 2019 race.

#The Even Harder Part (mile 56 until my gruesome death)
Now it was time to reset and get my head on straight for the Wittenberg Cornell Slide traverse. Unfortunately Devang's feet were too shredded to continue on and there would be no crew access for the next 25 miles, so I would have to prepare for a long night alone. A full change of clothing made me feel like a new man, and a beer and half a pizza didn't hurt either. Alex and Mike walked me to the next trail head while I ate, and then I was off on my own.

I had run this section of the Long Path in 2019 as part of the Cat's Tail Marathon but that was 1) in the reverse direction, 2) during daylight hours, and 3) on relatively fresh legs. The point I'm trying to make is that I didn't really know what I was in for. What I learned is that this section of trail is surprisingly difficult to follow and doesn't have a single water source for 13 uphill miles. Yeesh. I should have at least had a second beer before I left Phoenicia.

It took almost 4 hours of climbing through wet grass and leaves to reach the open summit of Wittenberg. My feet were soaked through and I was totally out of water. Thankfully I had a beautiful panoramic view to raise my spirits.

Ha! Just kidding, it was 2 in the morning and still raining/misting. I couldn't see more than a few feet in any direction.

My pace suffered as I grew increasingly dehydrated along the rocky traverse. In the col before Cornell, I finally gave in and scooped up a puddle of muddy water in my filter. I chugged it down eagerly, trying not to pay attention to how murky the it was. Then I figured that two bottles worth of puddle water wouldn't get me any sicker than one bottle. Down the hatch!

The summit of Cornell came fairly quickly. The summit of Slide did not. I was thankful for a bright headlamp and a good pair of shoes as I clambered through the dark over some of the most difficult on-trail terrain the Catskills has to offer.

Five and a half hours after leaving Phoenicia, I reached my first real water source, the spring on the east flank of Slide. I guzzled down bottle after bottle of the freezing cold water. Finally hydrated enough, I was able to take in some food, but my rest break ended abruptly when I realized that my core temperature was plummeting. I scrambled the rest of the way to the summit, stopping for a moment to mentally visualize what the view normally looks like.

Now at the high point of the course, I could make up some time on the downhills, right? Wrong! My feet were totally shot. 23 hours of mud and water had exacted a ghastly toll. My soles were hamburger meat. I gently tiptoed down the Curtis-Ormsbee Trail, watching my goal finish evaporate into the foggy air. The pain was so bad that I attempted to call Alex and tell her to meet me at the nearest trailhead. I was certain that I wouldn't make another 11 miles to our next aid station. Unfortunately, despite teasing me with a bar of reception, my phone could not connect to make a call or send a text.

The only thing I could keep doing was to move forward. An excruciating four mile descent brought me to the Neversink River, where I refilled my bottles again. I found that my uphill hiking was unaffected by my foot issues, and I made it to the summit of Table as the sun was starting to come out 26 hours into my adventure. A short traverse brought me to the summit of Peekamoose, the ninth and final high peak.

All that was left was a 2,500 foot descent to reach Alex and tap out. I soldiered forward, the skin on my feet threatening to slide off with each step. I envisioned pulling my shoes off at the finish and finding that they had taken all the skin and muscle off with them.

I heard a woman screaming softly in the distance and realized with horror that the sound was coming from my own mouth. I'm glad no one else was around to hear me. Let's just keep this part of the report a secret, shall we?

I counted down the miles until I could stop moving. Each one took an eternity. I would walk for what felt like an hour and look down to realize that 30 seconds had gone by.

Just when I started to come to terms with the fact that I had clearly died and was in purgatory descending this god forsaken mountain forever, I rounded a final bend and saw the parking lot. I gave a feeble call for Alex and she cheered me in through the last few weak strides of my Catskill adventure.

* Final time: 27:50:58
* Distance: 81 miles
* Evelation: 24,022 feet

#Postmortem
I announced to Alex that not only was I done for the day, but I never wanted to come back and try this route again. Then I sat down and told her all the things I would do differently when I attempted the route again. So I guess that settles it. If I couldn't even swear off the Manitou's Revenge 100 five minutes after dropping out, I suppose I'll come back again and do it right. I'm not sure when that will be, but you can rest assured that I'll check the weather reports before I start.

Technically, this could be considered an FKT since I replicated Tom DeHaan's route two hours faster (though notably, he was self supported and I had a crew). But I find it much more aesthetic to add on the last 12 miles of the Long Path and run the ""blue line to blue line"" as Mike originally proposed.

The only detail possibly worth mentioning is when putting in a lot of ascent and descent my max cadence is highly elevated to anywhere from 190-210, but my average cadence is still coming out as it usually does. I’m not facing any injuries and training seems to be going fine but I’m concerned about my Cardenas being so low especially for being a minimalist shoe guy. Could this be my ideal cadence? Or is there something else I should evaluate that could be effecting my cadence? In my mind I’d like to get up to 170. It just seems no matter how hard I try I can’t change my leg speed. No amount of drills or speed worth is helping. Even focused and dialed in zone 2 training seems impossible to get my cadence up. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",1600487716

**Training**

I started biking at the gym in mid January once or twice a week to lose weight and going through a break up. Gyms closed due to COVID and I started running. I was starting with 5km and remember thinking 15km would be super hard. I had a goal of running a 50km Ultra in April 2021 and quickly realized it would probably be impossible.

I kept running, and began to really enjoy it. I then started to really get into trail running. I ran my first Marathon by myself in 3:36 and this gave me a lot of confidence. I then started running up mountains with some decent times and began to think running 50km could happen soon. 

**Pre- Race**

&amp;#x200B;

* Parents were camping at Golden Ears 20km from where I started running. This would be my ""Aid Station"" I gave them extra shirts, socks, trail runners to change into, gatorade, food, gels, water, and a towel. I hesitated doing the run because it was very smokey out due to the wildfires. 

**Race**

* Started at 6:30am, first 20km would be on the road. The first 4km it was very smokey, almost called it quits as it was a little painful on the throat. It eventually got better. Ran the first 20km in 1:50 I think, felt very good. Stopped for a bit to refuel, and hit the trails.
* Did one loop about 15km and felt really good, said hi to all the hikers and some ever saw me on the road on the way up and thought I was nuts.
* Refueled again at km 35, still feeling pretty decent.  Went out back for another 15km trail loop. Saw the same hikers again and lapped them, they were amazed, this fueled me. At km 43 started to feel a bit tired now. At km 47 a bug flew into my eye, didn't get it out until km 50 when I refueled      again. Still feeling decent at this point, was thinking I could get to km 60. 
* at km 52 hit the pain cave, felt really nauseous, this lasted until km 58, then I felt betterish... 
* My phone and therefore music died at km 60, luckly I had service at one point to fire off a text to have my brother pick me up as I didn't think I could make it 10 more km home.
* My phone and garmin fenix 3 said I was at 60km at this point and my garmin forerunner 245 said I was at 55km. I was gonna push until I reached 60km on the 245.
* Finally at km 65 My brother arrived and I did it, my first ever Ultra, something I never thought could be done and I did it!

**Post Race:**

* Didn't want to eat for an hour after, then became very hungry .
* Legs were sore, was very hard to sleep
* Still a bit sore.

Ultramarathon,NinjaMBA,Ultramarathons in Eastern NY,"So I'm trying to figure out which race I want to use to pop my ""ultramarathon cherry."" I'm based in Poughkeepsie, NY and I'd like to find something within a reasonable driving distance (1-3 hours, in an ideal world).

I've been digging around on Facebook and Ultra Sign up for ideas, but considering the state of 2020 and my own lack of preparedness for an ultra this year, I'm trying to find races in 2021.

Any recommendations for first time races? I'm open to trying any distances, but would prefer a 50 miler. I'm not closed off to the idea of having a 100 miler as my first, although I realize conventional wisdom would generally suggest to try a shorter distance ultra.

Right now, I'm eyeing the Tesla Hertz Trail Race in October 2021. Any other recommendations?

Ultramarathon,jackfrain,Losing 1.4kg during race,"Hi all,

Today I completed a 100km Challenge that was absolutely draining.

I lost 1.4kg during the race. I'm aware that's probably not so healthy to lose that much weight in a day. Essentially I'm looking for advice, do I need to try and put that weight back on or just continue as normal?

I'm not the thinnest guy ever, and could do with losing that weight - but I doubt that's the healthiest way of doing so.

Could anyone advise? What should my recovery plan be in terms of weight here?",1599680760

I live in the city and am currently under quarantine so don't have access to anything technical. However I am a keen hiker and have spent a fair bit of time in the past hiking the trail I intend to run.

Most of the running I have done so far has been on road so I don't have any trail specific gear. I currently run in Asics Gel Kayano. Any advice on a kit list for running this unsupported would be great.

Ultramarathon,MJS29,Completed my first Ultra distance run yesterday - 36 miles / 58km,"So I posted a while back that I had entered my first 50 mile race and got some great feedback and tips for training.

Training went well for a while but I think I peaked a bit early and then picked up some niggly injuries. August was a bit of a write off for training, I managed a bit of football and some CrossFit but not as many runs as I'd have liked.

Got back into it this week as I'm well aware I needed the miles in my legs ahead of the race. My plan would have had me doing 10 miles Saturday and 32 miles Sunday this weekend so instead I played football for 90 minutes, covering about 5 miles on Saturday and then did 4 laps of a local 9 mile route.

Really enjoyed it and was 10 miles more than I've ran before. I finished strong with more in the tank, though legs were in agony but I managed to power through the pain with a mix of walking and running.

Also got my nutrition dialled in and feel I ate the right amounts at the right times and had no gut/digestion problems

I've unofficially entered the Ultra territory. 12 days till I officially make it (fingers crossed)

Prior to the last 2 years id say i was an above average runner just due to military job and lifestyle. After my last trip to Afghanistan 2017-2018 where i did no running and all the lifting/eating i came home at 220lbs at 73” tall. Im still around 27bmi and 200 lbs but have completely cut most the heavy lifting out without sacrificing job performance. I ran a half marathon in 1:36 nov 2019, then stopped running while away for training for 3 months, came back in January and ran a 3:36 full marathon, didnt fee great about it, and felt super out of running shape, but full send as always. Now im trying to take this ultramarathon train up seriously after how much of a kick between the legs the no train up marathon was and was kinda curious how frequently run/walk is actually done in longer ultras. Im averaging about 50mpw + or - 5-10, and have done so since about april. With the long run being around 18 in my LTz2, i really feel i could run forever. The heat has caused my z2 runs to significantly slow down so generally by the end im fully capable of running for hours longer if i had to. 

Im doing the big beach marathon in January as a sort of tuner race although i understand the idea of doing a full marathon in prep to do a 4 straight marathon race is meh. But will be doing a 50m self race towards the end of feb/early march. And a self 50k in April as i start finalizing the keys100.  

Anyone else heard of/doing the keys 100? Im pretty excited to see how i handle the mental aspect of a 100mile race.",1599324290

Ultramarathon,Tomfur,Suggestion for hydration vest,"Hello everyone hope you are doing lovely,

I wanted hear some opinions on hydration vests. I have mainly done events that are ranging from 50k to 100k. For all those events and training runs I’ve been using a pretty cheap and extremely uncomfortable hydration vest and sometimes wasn’t even carrying it because of the discomfort.  I think it is long overdue for me to invest in a good vest that will last me for a good while.

I was thinking I will go with Salomon as I have looked into few other brands but everyone seems so happy with Salomon that I did not see any reason to make the decision more complex. My problem is that I absolutely hate bladders while running. I think the whole hose system is very uncomfortable and feels weird on me. I’d rather have 2 flasks in front and carry a few extra in the back pouches if need be. For that reason I was thinking S-Lab sense ultra series for the non-bulky back. 

I’d be happy the hear some opinions on the sense ultra and adv skin series and what would be the wiser choice for me. Also what would you suggest in terms of which volume to get? 

Also I figured you need a quiver for poles in sense ultra, are there any creative methods without using a quiver or should I just order a quiver also if I go ahead with the purchase?

Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I am running the 100 mile distance in the Angry Owl Ultra Marathon in Bush's Pasture Park here in Salem this Saturday. I have 24 hours to complete 100 miles. Would you consider donating .25 cents per mile, or whatever you can afford? If you donate this week your donation will be matched 100%, doubling its impact! Marion Polk Food Share can feed 300 people for $100, so if you donated $100 for 100 miles that would feed 600 people! If you are able to donate, please put Angry Owl Ultra in the comments section at the bottom of the donation form so the food share can track donations from this event! If you want to come and tell me how silly it is to run around in a big circle for 100 miles, my race starts at 9AM this Saturday. Remember to mask up!

**When:** November 22nd (Headlands 100 in Marin, Ca)

**Ultra History:** I've completed seven 50ks (around 6 hours each +/- 30min), including back to back weeks. COVID19 canceled the 50-miler and 100k I had been training for.

**Training Plan:** Sage Canaday 100m Plan (Although I prefer back to back 20+ long runs on weekends). Longest unsupported long run was 40 miles with 8ft ascent and it felt very comfortable.

**Training Base:** Currently average 50-70 mpw for the last year. Recently switched my weekdays to include a recovery run, speed workout, and easy run, before a day of rest proceeding back to back weekend long runs in Marin. 

**Nutrition:** Tailwinds, Cliff Bars. I shoot for 200 calories per hour. In training, my 2L bladder usually gets me out to 25 miles comfortably (takes around 5 hours so 1000 calories of Tailwinds).

**Pacer:** Currently training up my pacer, who can join me after 50 miles. Mostly moral support!

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. Can I use Tailwinds for all 100 miles targeting 200 calories a hour and supplementing with Cliff Bars and whatever else I can stomach at aid stations?
2. Should I train some midnight runs up in Marin? Is this worth preparing for?
3. Are poles necessary? When do those come in handy?
4. Are there any pieces of gear specific to the 100 miler I need to acquire and train with?
5. Anything I'm missing?

Ultramarathon,jbeech01,What type of training should I do?,"As above, I have been working my way into shape and want to get on a track to complete my dream race in 2021 or 2022. 

Background: 

I yo-yo quite a bit on my training and my weight. For example, I was around 245 lbs in December of 2016 and, although I hadn't run in a couple years, signed up for a full IM. I lost 50 pounds by December 2017 and crushed my goal with a 12:30 time. Then I promptly stopped working out. I usually don't run for about 6 months, put on the weight and then sign up for something big. I've run many marathons this way, did the Dopey challenge in 2019, and have done a few half IM and one full IM. 

However, I have now set a goal for a year or two out of being able to run Leadville. I know, I know but it's there now and I can't just pick something easier. With that in mind, I started running and biking in February and I've dropped about 20 lbs. I'm in decent shape and although I'm not at my IM weight of 195, I'm at 216 which is a good start. I'm 6'2"" btw. 

So here is my question, I've realized over the past couple months that I wanted to rebuild my aerobic base and boy was that humbling. Doing an 80 minute Zone 2 ""run"" where I had to walk a ton was not fun. But I'm in much better shape now and am trying to figure out what to do next. Should I do a HR training  Marathon plan through Garmin (using my HR strap) or do something through iFit on my incline treadmill. ( I just got the X22i because we don't have mountains here and if I'm going to do Leadville, I'll need some serious hills; the X22i goes up to 40% incline). The iFit programs don't look like they're HR specific so it would just be the normal ""run x miles"" today training. I've really enjoyed the HR training so I'm not sure how this would fit. 

Keep going with HR training or change to a normal training? 

Also, my goal was to continue to try and run this summer/fall, sign up for a marathon in October and then judge whether to enter the Leadville lottery in December. Any thoughts on all that would e appreciated as well also!",1596468568
Ultramarathon,FlyingRocketman,UPDATE: Ultra Marathon in 3.5 months. I've never ran a race in my life.,"Previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/gjjoly/ultra\_marathon\_in\_35\_months\_ive\_never\_ran\_a\_race/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/gjjoly/ultra_marathon_in_35_months_ive_never_ran_a_race/)

So im back from completing my first Ultra, and I thought I’d update you on the race and my experience.

Short backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

* I have a podcast with a friend and we decided to run an ultra-marathon without any previous experience
* We both have an extensive background from martial arts, so we’re not super out of shape in general - but we’ve never ran anything before
* The furthest i’ve ran previously was around 2,5miles.
* We had 3 months to train - i overtrained and had to sit out for around 3 of those weeks.
* The race was 62km over a mountainrange in the northern part of Norway called Telegrafruta

The first 15km went pretty well - but when i started the waterintake and eating (chocolate, nuts, gels etc.) i vomited around 5min afterwards. This was my first clue that something was off.

The first foodstop was at 23km - i informed them of my condition so that someone knew i was struggling with energy levels.

&amp;#x200B;

* Felt an intense urge to urinate from this point on, but very little came out and what did was cloudy and bloody.

I got some potatochips to bring with me from the first food station, and took some salt pills as well. I could only take microscopic amounts of water and food to avoid vomiting it up again right after.

&amp;#x200B;

* Queue second food station at 43km - was feeling somewhat OK at this point

At around 50km i got cellphone-coverage again (lost between 15-50km) and updated the even organizer and some contacts on my condition. Shared real-time location via GPS so they could track me.

Because of dehydration and low energy i ran off-track which took around 1hour to correct. I was pretty defeated at this point since the backtracking was across super-rough terrain (small glacier and some climbing).

The main organizer started running towards my location and met me at around 52km - he was pretty worried. We had some talks with rescue services and they almost insisted to send a helicopter to pick me up (no cost).

I refused and said i was not going to be airlifted out - i honestly felt fine at this point and was 100% sure i could finish the race.

We talked some more and they could tell i had clarity and presence of mind - combined with the event organizer at my side - and they let me finish the race.

Finished after 14,5h because of 1,5h of running the wrong path twice.

Decided to check into the emergency room for a checkup and got sent straight to intensive care because of rhabdomyolysis and kidneyfailure as a result from the lack of water and food intake - i basically ran 70km on some potatochips and a little water.

I was checked out the next day (today) after the tests were looking better - and i feel pretty good besides some muscle-soreness.

Yes, i realized this was an idiotic idea. Yes i realize this could have affected others besides myself.

No I wouldn’t have made the same decisions knowing what i know now - i would have broken off the race at the first foodstop.

Do i regret it? no. absolutely not.",1596406374

Ultramarathon,j4ckxandxj1ll,Got one year to train for a 100 mile route,"Hey :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an individual who loves to explore the boundaries of my body and mind. Recently, I got the idea of running a 100 mile race, and over the weeks I have really talked myself into doing it. I'm relatively fit, I do mostly strength and speed based training though, which is largely irrelevant for ultras.

Being new to the ultra scene, I have a few questions.

One, how many days a week should I train? Ideally I would train 3 days a week, I don't have more time.

What is a MUST distance that I must reach? E.g. ""If you can run 60 miles, you can push to 100""...

During the trainings, is there something I need to be wary of in terms of nutrition? I know that in long distance nutrition is very important, and I heard a lot of people learn what their body needs and go on that.

My Goal here is not to set a good time, or be in the top 50%. I fully expect to be crying and bleeding and not being able to walk for a few weeks after, but that's what I want. I know this is not the most orthodox way of running an ultra and I hope the pros here forgive me, but I will challenge myself and push myself beyond what my mind thinks is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to say, I am comfortable running 20km+, and I do day hikes with 50km ",1595266157
Ultramarathon,Web11002,"Zone 2 training, 70-80 percent of what??","Hey everyone! I recently did a VO2 Max test and the trainer who administered the test had an interesting opinion I wanted to share with the group.

The test was 20 minutes: 5 min warm up, 5 minutes increasing speed on the minute, followed by 5 minutes increasing incline on the minute, and then 5 minutes continuing at that pace. I did the test mainly so I could calculate my heart rate zones. All my training is currently being done in zone 2, or between 70 and 80 percent of my max heart rate.

Well, he never got me to my true max. After the test I felt I had a lot more to give and I still don’t know my VO2 max. What the hell did I pay for?? Here’s what he said, “You’re VO2 max is not a useful benchmark. You should focus on your VO2 level at your anaerobic threshold.”  Your anaerobic threshold is the point at which your body performance starts to decline. It’s where your body can no longer process lactate faster than its being produced, increasing soreness and fatigue. If you are trying to improve your endurance, this is your benchmark. You should not be training at 70 to 80 percent of you max heart rate, rather 70 to 80 percent of your heart rate at anaerobic threshold!

Kris writes with years of running and racing under his belt and is really a jack of all trades when it comes to the distance and terrain he races. With his homebase in Santa Barbara, California, Kris has come to specialize in hilly 50k-100k races. In 2018, Kris walked away with a top-ten finish at Western States 100, and more recently he finished the 2019 Spartan Ultra World Championships in 5th place and was the top American at Tarawera 100K.

He'll pop in here at some point and answer your questions, but I wanted to share this since people always seem to ask nutrition questions and there's a lot of things that surprised me (like how many people race 100s on just gels and sports drink).

Ultramarathon,badjuju__,Am I being unrealistic in running a 73km (flat) ultra in December?,"Hi guys I'm 35, ex military, and have ran on and off for most of my life. At my peak some years ago I was running around 50 miles per week and could run a 3hr:45min marathon in relatively hilly conditions. I've always wanted to run an ultra but for one reason or another never managed it. Most notably I tore a ligament a month out from the MDS in a sporting accident. 

Anyway I've decided that, for better or worse, this year is going to be my year. I currently have a decent base of fitness and run around 20-25km I can run 5k in about 25 minutes. By my own standards I'm not in great shape but I've always been a decent runner and I enjoy it. 

 I'm planning to build weekly total to about 80km per week at about 10% per week minus rest weeks and then taper down with a max long run of about 50km. I'll be doing hill repeats and HIIT to try to get a race pace of 6:30.

In your view how unrealistic is my plan? Assuming I figure out the right balance of training and nutrition of course. I'm pretty tough but I do need to be respectful to the prospect of injury. One of my weaknesses is that I can push myself too far physically.  Any advice welcome.",1591815111

I am not that familiar with this community, but I would like to reach out as I heard there might be interest here on what I am currently looking into.

As a result, I made that about my graduate courses.

For the time being, I am wondering if this community would care about having a portable device that would allow us to monitor electrolytes similar to a blood glucose monitor - on demand and portable?  If so, would you prefer something that is not at all invasive like an ecg monitor? but could only measure certain electrolytes?  Or would you be willing to accept something slightly more invasive that would draw liquid like sweat from your body (not painful at all), and be able to measure all of the electrolytes?

Probably one of those thread's that comes up annoyingly often, so I apologise in advance. I'm reading through the sub but even on the first page some of the threads are several months old so was hoping people are more likely to reply to me a new thread

Uk based, so currently still in lockdown although its been eased once and will probably be eased again by June so I have signed up to my first 50 miler in September and hoping it will go ahead.

I don't have a huge running background, I ran a half marathon race a year ago and have done a couple of 10kms. I've played football semi professionally and compete in CrossFit competitions so have a decent level of fitness.

Since lockdown over the last 6 weeks I have increased my running, I've done 2 of the IronMan VC cahllenges 3/40/10k run/bike/run at the start and 5/90/21k a couple of weeks ago. In between that I've ran a half marathon again, a 30km, and my first marathon distance. 

I took a week off after the last IronmanVC I did to recover, and then started a running plan to get my weekly miles up with some different paced runs. I did 28.5 last week and this week I've done 6 (+9 on the bike in place of a recovery run) with 18 more to go, next weeks about 30 etc.

Has anyone got any general advice for transitioning from Marathon to Ultra? I'm going to try and grab another pair of running shoes as soon as I can get in a shop, I track my runs with Strava and an apple watch. My fueling probably needs some work, I did the marathon on Lucozades and Haribo so probably not ideal.

Also do people generally run the whole 50 miles non stop, or is it coming for people to take breaks after a certain stage and have a proper re-feed? My IronmanVC took my 8.5 hours in total so I know how it feels to train for that long, and I took about 30 minutes recovery between bike and run to get drink and food in.

Ultramarathon,onward_wego,Recent lung removal: any others with this experience? --&gt; Hoping to run a 50m,"Hi all! 

I'll keep it short: lifelong athlete here, 30, otherwise fit and healthy. I had a bottom lobe of my lung removed two months ago due to a big ole cancerous tumor, and am just getting back into the swing of things. I'm hoping to run a 50m at the end of November -- longest I've run is a marathon -- and am wondering if there are any fellow runner friends on here who have had the same surgery, and how you found it affected your training. I'm bound and determined to do it. :) 

Any advice for a) a 50m first-timer and, b) someone with a bit of a limited cardio capacity? I'm not hoping to finish in any certain time, but rather just finish under the cut-off (13:00:00). 

&amp;#x200B;

Current running status: I've been jumping back and forth between 1min run/1 min walk; .5mi run/.5mi walk for about four miles. This is my first week back on my feet, and I've done this 4x total. 

Thanks tons -- be safe out there! Happy trails.

Ultramarathon,TylerCAndrews,New Running Book Club - Read great books with fellow ultra-runners and pros,"Heya Fellow Ultra-Runners!

Your friendly resident pro and book nerd here to announce that I've finally tackled my life-long goal - no, not going to the Olympics - starting [**a book club**](https://www.chaski.run/post/welcome-to-the-chaski-book-club)**!**

We're trying to create ways for runners of all levels to engage with each other, share ideas, and connect from around the globe. The book club is just one of many ways we're planning to do that. And honestly, I'm just a nerd and love to read and talk about books and so this is just a fun project for me.

We'll announce a book each month, suggesting manageable weekly chunks and lead guided discussions each week via the[ **Chaski Facebook Page**](https://www.facebook.com/chaskiendurance/)**.**

The first book will be:

**“What I Talk About When I Talk About Running” by**[ **Haruki Murakami**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)**.**

**Why?** It’s a short book (only 193 pages) and a wonderful memoir of a fantastic writer who’s also a passionate, long-time runner.

We'll give you time to get the book and the **first discussion will begin on Monday, May 18 (it's done via text comments, so you'll have all week to read and discuss).**

You can[ **register here**](https://www.chaski.run/book-club-signup) to receive only Chaski Book Club updates or subscribe to the[ Chaski Blog](http://chaski.run/blog) to receive all Chaski content (bookclub included).

**How will this work?**

Each Monday, we’ll create a new post on the[ **Chaski Facebook Page**](https://www.facebook.com/chaskiendurance/), which will include that week’s chapter(s) to read and discussion questions to think about.

You can read at your own pace over the week and then reply to the discussion questions (via a comment on that week’s post) with your own thoughts, read over the thoughts of the rest of the group and - hopefully - learn something new from everyone else’s ideas and engage in some real conversations.

If you’re arriving late, or want to easily go back, you can see all the Chaski Book Club posts and discussions in one place by viewing[ **#ChaskiBookClub on Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/chaskibookclub)**.**

We plan to read 1 book per month (though some longer books might have to be split) and at the end of each book have a live video-call discussion with whomever wants to join to talk about the book as a whole, get your feedback, and announce the next book.

**What’s the catch? How much will I have to pay? Will all the books be about running?**

The catch is that we’re a bunch of nerds that like to read :)

You’ll never have to pay a dime for the Chaski Book Club. We do, however, believe in supporting artists and writers, so please buy their books.

No, we'll read some running books, some books about other aspects of sport or endurance, and some books that seem to have nothing to do with running at all but someone suggested it or it seemed relevant. That said, we're all runners and will likely end up talking about all these books through the eyes of endurance athletes.

Hope you'll join me -- see you out there!

Love,

Ty",1589629554
Ultramarathon,kavakavakav,. Training at sea level...,"Hi guys, so I’ve been stuck training for my first ultra in Chicago due to COVID. I’ve ran several flat marathons before and I decided to sign up for a mountain race in July a while back. 53.5 mi Race with +\- 10k feet vert at 9-12k feet above sea level. Training has been going very well. I’ve been consistently doing 40 mile weeks and pacing sub 9 min/mile on my long runs. The only issue is I am training on a flat surface. I am dedicating my Tuesdays to intensive lower body strength training, and I am usually running unassisted with all of my gear and water. 

I will be at half elevation for 3 days and then full elevation for another 3 days before the race in July. Is there anything else I should do to prep that I am not currently doing? Thanks!",1589552919

I'm planning to step it up and do the Bigfoot 73 in August (73 miles, 14,410 feet elevation gain). My running route is hilly but not THAT hilly, so my plan was just to use a 100 mile plan (this one: https://www.ultrarunningltd.co.uk/training-schedule/100-mile/100-mile-training-schedule) with the days shifted a bit and hope that the additional mileage preparation will make up for the lack of hills. I was also going to add weighted stair climbers if my gym would ever open up again.

See my plan/progress here: https://imgur.com/qlTBlOy

Me: Novice. Kinda heavy at 200 lbs (6' 1""). Hoping to start the race at around 185 lbs. The runs I've been doing have been going well. That 50k I did a few weeks ago finished with a 9:14/mile pace. Other than that the long runs so far have been between 8:40-9:10/mile.

Reflecting on it now, this 100 mile plan seems a bit light. My concern is that I'm going into this thing with my long run (which I do five times) being less than half of the total distance I'm trying to do.

This is normally something like 10x400m or 5 x 1000m with 2 min Rec.

I know races like the Pony Express in UT allow dogs. And there's plenty of shorter road races where dogs can finish  with you or run the last mile or whatever. So I don't mean dog friendly in the classic ""they're welcome to spectate on the trail but keep them closely leashed"". I mean, are there trail runs or Ultras where my dog is allowed to run alongside me for some/all of the race? I know it's unlikely, as dogs on a race course is a huge liability for race directors.

I had one 100km race scheduled for the end of May this year. The last race I did was the end of August last year.

I'd put off signing up for the August race again because of work commitments. BUT it seems like I have at least a week bergen the race and work starting again in September!

Ultramarathon,gac1208,Losing too much weight,"Hi everybody.

Recently coming off a weight loss journey (50+ pounds). I have gotten into endurance running and also weight lifting. It has gotten to be rather difficult to maintain my weight (150lbs). I am a 5’9” 25M. Running roughly 30-35 miles a week right now. My goal is to maintain weight at 150, but cut my body fat down a bit. I’m running an ultra in September! Can’t wait. 

My workouts burn approximately 1,000 calories per day. Would this mean I need to be consuming roughly 3,000 to maintain my body weight (2,000 regular, then 1,000 to offset my workouts?) what foods would you recommend I cut out to cut my body fat as a runner and not face fatigue?

Thank you!",1582049170
Ultramarathon,chiefpompadour,Life Support to Ultra in 18mos.,"So, I’m a new runner with an insane goal and I would like some advice. In July of last year I went through a life changing medical emergency that landed me in a coma for two weeks and on life support for 3 weeks. In total I was in the ICU for 38 days and had to go to inpatient rehab to learn to walk again. One thing I realized through this ordeal is that my mind and body are capable of sooo much more than I gave them credit for and I feel this strange compulsion to test those limits. Logistically speaking, Mountaineering is out of the question so I decided an Ultra would fit the bill nicely. 
 My plan is to run the Arches Ultra 50k in 2021. I hate running and that is why I want to do it. So, Ultra community, I’m coming to you for advice. I’ve consumed a fair amount of info but I’m still open to any wisdom you’re willing to share. I ran/walked a 13:07 mile today (just one) for the first time in 3 yrs. and it felt like shit. My plan is to start prehab with my trainer next week to minimize risk of injury as I start on a half-marathon training plan. Do I need a running coach if I my only goal is to finish or will a well balanced personal trainer suffice? If I continue to lift will it be detrimental to my training? Should I get fitted for shoes now or wait until my mechanics improve? Has anyone here ran Arches Ultra before?",1581979520

I've tried it out a bit and it seems to do the trick, but my only concern is the large amount of baking soda my body will be processing (especially on the longer runs yet to come) due to its alkaline properties.

Ultramarathon,Trentongibbons,Apple Watch vs sports watch?,"I’ve been running for a year and a half now with my Apple Watch.   It tracks my distance, location, heart rate  and using intervals pro app I can create custom interval workouts.  Syncing with Strava is always seamless.  Aside from this it locates my phone (which can be useful if you often look for your phone like me) and I can pay at stores when I’m on my runs without bringing a wallet.  It also seamlessly loads playlists from my phone on the watch and I can listen with earbuds which also always connect seamlessly.  

It seems like everyone advocates for getting a real sports watch but I don’t understand what it does that is superior to an Apple Watch (besides battery life).  I’m worried I’m going to get a sports watch and find it less intuitive and have difficulty listening to music and syncing.  Except for battery life on those 5+ hour runs, what can a sports watch provide that I don’t have?  I really want to feel good about buying one.  Please someone convince me!!",1581829899
Ultramarathon,DrGabe1423,Advice for a stupid and lazy runner,"So... I started my journey running 5-6 months ago. I joined a half-marathon training program at my University.  I ran that and did ok (about 1:50). Since I’ve run another half and a marathon.

The thing is, I didn’t really train specifically for the marathon. I kinda just winged it with my half marathon training. It went ok. I finished In 4:36 which I know is kinda slow, but my goal was more to complete first and be fast second.

Now after some inspirational Joe Rogan episodes (Courtney Dauwaulter in particular) I want to run a 50 miler (the Daytona 100).

My stupid in head math says if I split the 50 miles into 26 and 24. I could run the first part in 5 hrs. And then walk the rest and theoretically finish in 13-14 hours.

I guess I like suffering. Am I crazy? Also I would be doing this after completing the sprint triathalon training offered this semester. And training a bit more during the summer.

The race is on Dec 5 giving me a few months after the triathlon training to really ramp up the miles.

Ultramarathon,Ultra-Trex,Race/Activity utility datafield for garmin using runners,"Just a PSA kind of thing.  Not sure if there's a very big potential audience but the feature enhanced version of my garmin datafield went public this morning. 

It's written primarily for my activities as an ultra runner but the basic functionality could be useful for any race down to 5k.   And by making it public it makes it easier for my immediate running group to get a copy so... public it is.  If you think you might get some use out if it, then feel free. 

 [https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/02dcb3a7-b862-4299-9a2d-66116050734a](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/02dcb3a7-b862-4299-9a2d-66116050734a) 

It's an extended feature version of this one I wrote [https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/6257a0bf-058c-4d8e-a9c7-a951852132e0](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/6257a0bf-058c-4d8e-a9c7-a951852132e0)

Note: No clickbait, I get zero anything from a click, a download or a drive by look.  It's not my thing to release a datafield with any pay to play features cut, this is the exact same version that sits on my watch. 

**Unfortunately the new extended version only works on newer garmins due to memory limitations.  The x45+music, 5X, 5+'s, 6 Pros, Marq's.**   The older garmin watches have a real world limit of around 28K for a datafield and even keeping things as lean as I can I'm now at 31k to 32K peak run time depending on how many data points are used for the look back window and update cycle. And scrimp as I might, I just can't find 3K to cut out of the memory usage. 

It's showing very good prediction data  for me for everything from a 5K  race to my longer runs.  It predicted my replay of my last 5K PR finish to within a minute after the first few minutes once I settled into my pace and a 50 mile finish within 30 minutes 4 hours in. That's the benefit of using the simulator to replay recorded activites; I know exactly when I hit specific distances for real and if the datafield is showing that same expected time hours ahead then yay math and averaging works.  Unfortunately the simulator dies on replays somewhere between 10 and 12 hours every time so I can't do longer races. :(

Features:

You got this: An runner set inspirational short phrase that will flash at you on the datafield while it's paused pre start and the datafield is on the screen.

Finish Time: Predicts your current projected finish time for the target distance based on a configurable look back time window and update cycle.

Weighting: You can set a weighted predictive average from 50% to 100% of the lookback window. This helps average out highs and lows if you have the weighting less than 100%.

Pace Warnings: If you're too far ahead of or behind your overall target finish time (or next checkpoint) it'll display how far ahead or behind you are. You can set how big a percentage off pace it should trigger on and change the color of the watch face and text. Defaults to red face for 'too hot' and blue for 'too cold'.

Better Elapsed Time: Elapsed or Remaining (predicted) time in hours and minutes (who gives a deuce about seconds in a hundred?) to work around Garmin's ridiculously tiny hours font when it goes double digits.

Race Checkpionts: Add up to 9 checkpoints over the course of the race with a distance, time and optional name. The display will predict how far ahead or behind you are to the next checkpoint time and optionally flip between the elapsed time and checkpoint time in one of the 3 fields.

Mileage Correction: Set up to 2 'mileage correction' checkpoints and correct the prediction using the pause button to trigger them. For example say there's an aid station at mile 52. So you can add a correction checkpoint of 52 miles. When you get to that aid station you see your watch has measured 49 miles. Pause and unpause the activity and now the datafield will predict on the corrected mileage. You can set a second correction checkpoint further down the road as well to re-correct it. Pause a 3rd (or more) time to disable corrections.

Non-Moving Tracking: It can track non-moving time in real time and display it on screen if it exceeds x% of your target time or always. You can also turn on a real time non-moving timer that will start displaying each time you're stopped for 60+ seconds. Non-Moving time is based on cadence, not GPS data to avoid GPS 'scatter distance' during stops. Non-Moving time is displayed rounded down to the nearest minute and only displays when there is 1+ minutes of it.

Color Configurable: You can of course change the color of the screen and text and have different colors for being hot, cold and on pace.",1581113469
Ultramarathon,davidjohnallen87,2nd attempt at an Ultra Marathon.,"Hey guys,

I gave Ultra running a go back in September 2019 and DNF'd at the Marathon finish, which was on the Ultra route and swept me up just like it meant too.   I felt really bad during that race, with a tough week at work and poor nutrition the night previously. 

I am going again on the 22nd February and in all honesty just looking for some words of encouragement or confidence on the back of my training. I have typically ran 30-40 miles per week for 16 weeks, culminating with 20-26-31.1 mile (25th Jan) runs through January weekends. 

Those runs have hurt my knee a bit but I am OK.  On the back of the 31.1m I had really poor performance because I had a trans-atlantic return trip in 3 days!!

I have only managed to run 8 miles in a given run since then, but I am hoping for a 20 mile run this weekend before tapering off for 2 weeks. 

I am mentally killing myself here thinking I haven't done enough as I only ran 20 miles since the 31.1 mile run and I am scared I won't be able to get the 20 miles done this weekend as a result.  Could you guys give me a bit of a confidence boost that my fitness won't entirely have dropped off a cliff since running the 50km and then only managing 20 miles in two weeks? 

I don't think I can handle another DNF :D ...",1580935216
Ultramarathon,thefresher12,Attempting first 80km this year.,"Hey all. So I'm going to have a crack at an 80km. I was a runner for most of my life. Nothing too serious, but could always knock out 10-20km no problem. However in the last year I've changed to only wearing barefoot shoes and sometimes zero drop vans etc. I've noticed I'm a hell of a lot slower. I'm running at about 6mins per km. And then usually one of my calves gets worn out. Is it wise to do first ultra in barefoot shoes? Or should I try something that is close to barefoot but not quite. Im guessing 6m per km isn't too bad for an ultra. But for 15km it's not too great is it. And at this stage I'm working to a plan I found online so gradually increasing etc. Any advice would be much appreciated.",1580862258

Ultramarathon,FullTwentyCharacters,I [19M] ran my first ultra(50k)!,"I started out over a year ago with a love for exercise and fascination with how cool our bodies are.  I read “Born to Run”, “Endure” and “Can’t hurt me”(if you know of other good ones hmu!). I got so much out of them, they changed my life and perspective. 

What I realized most is we are capable of more than we know and there’s a satisfaction in knowing you are able to endure(love that word lol) something difficult for so long. 

Anyway, I set out at 5:30 a.m. last Saturday carrying 2 gatorades, sour patch kids and a bunch of bars in a small backpack. I’m in the Midwest and the ground was covered in a mix of icy snow and slush which made it way harder! Within 10 minutes my feet were soaked and the trails were riddled with icy footprints, making it much more technical and physically demanding. 

I had the run planned out and just focused on being “in the moment”. Early on I maintained an easy 11:00 mile following some advice to walk every 10min or so. By the halfway point it took a conscious effort to stay moving at a 13-14:00 mile while dodging footprints and puddles. I was getting exhausted and maintained this state the rest of the way. Surprisingly I had never thought to quit, I finished with a 13:11/mi average (7:21:23) and a distance of 33.5 miles which I found out is over 50k!

Ultramarathon,Ves2341,Avoiding Calorie Deficit,"So I've been running consistently since this time last year, and in that time I'd say I've become more physically active in general with regular strength training added in as well. I ran a marathon last year and am eyeing another this year with a 50k likely thrown into the mix as well. I noticed during the marathon training that I was shredding weight. I'm a fairly skinny guy with a low body fat percentage so I took that as a sign that I needed to consume more calories to compensate for more physical activity. 

Well, I've noticed my weight trending down again. Not drastically but enough that I feel I need to 'catch up' with calorie intake so it doesn't nose dive as training picks back up. But I just can't seem to find a consistent way to do so. Any tips? I know, I know eat more. But I find it hard to fit more meals in with a hectic work schedule. I've added two smoothies daily with whey, oats, fruit, whole milk spinach etc as it's an easy way to add 400-600 calories. Should I just do more of that?

Ultramarathon,fimmx,Tips for strengthening your feet,"What strategies have been successful for you to strengthen your feet? In long distance races, after about 6 hours, my feet   start complaining. Loudly. Thankfully blisters are not an issue (yet), but my soles just seem to get really sensitive and painful. Short of spending hours on my feet, are there any other less time consuming workouts I could try to make them stronger? Is there a distinction between strong feet and strong skin on feet? Is painful feet a natural by product of long distance running and I just need to suck it up and get used to it? I run in Altras (Escalante, Torin and Timp) but hesitate to go the more and more cushion route only because it seems like a crutch and does not address the underlying cause. TIA!",1578074824
Ultramarathon,Barefootdan,2020 first 50k or 50M,"I'm looking to make a goal in 2020 to run my first ultra. But I am trying to decide on either a 50k or 50M as my first. Is running a 50M as my first a bit too much?

Some background on my running: I've done 3 half marathons over the past 2 years. Most recent was the Mesquite Canyon Half in March 2019. 1700ft of elevation gain with a time of 2:33 and I felt great at the end! I do the Grand Canyon hike twice a year (south kaibab-phantom ranch-bright angle) and while tough, I finish without much issue. I regularly run 2-3 times a week on trail at 3-6 mile runs (~750ft of climbing average each). Last spring I was training for a 50K and had training runs up to 13 miles without injury but fell sick and I had to stop training to recover over the following months. And not exactly pertaining (hopefully related due to exerting effort over many hours) to running but I completed a 100k mountain bike ride in August at just under 7hrs. 

I plan to sign up for an event in the winter months, think Oct-Dec. McDowell Mountain Frenzy in November is at the top of the list so far. So we have a solid 9 months minimum to prepare. I feel comfortable doing the 50k mentally, a 50M would be my real test and goal. 

So in the end, going from a 10-15 MPW to a 50M event in 9 months, dumb? Should I stick with a 50k?

Happy Trails!

Edit: I modified an existing 50miler program and scaled it down to current weekly mileage. I tried to keep the percentage increase for long runs and total MPW consistent. I took advice from below and added a 50k race into my training. Thoughts?

Ultramarathon,BuzzinLikeNeonNeon,Is 2020 the year for first Ultra,"Let preface this with I was given the running bug from siblings in my family. That being said I’m a total poser and hopped on the gravy train just before ultra trial YouTube channels were a thing. I was just super impressed with the amount of content and how in depth it was in terms of being helpful. That and all the earth porn.  I guess I’m reaching out to larger communities because its easier to admit that I think its “silly” to spend the cash for a group run where pretty much everyone gets a effort award.  Ive prepped for Ultras for a while now, and i have put my blood sweat and tears into the training, just cant commit to registering. My only race was not a good one i just felt like i was hurdling people for the first couple k, only later to be gassed from all the zigging and zagging. Any advice is welcome here.

Ultramarathon,jipsow,Legends of Reddit - Advice 1st 60km,"Legends of Reddit,

Came across an advert for a 60km road race. My SO said ""no way you could do that"". I aim to prove her wrong. I back myself 100% as have run marathons in the past and 60km seems small change compared to feats of many of the esteemed redditors on this sub. 
My questions aren't so much about training as they are about kit and support. It will be almost entirely self supported (3rd world country and I am expat here) with only a few water opportunities. 
A) kit suggestions to purchase (mid range expense but potentially longer term use)
B) shoes?
C) self supported running - food, gels, playlists, anything? 

Any recommendations on kit etc would be huge.

Little background on event -
- mostly road
- tropical country (high 20s low 30s temp)
- minimal to no support

Ultramarathon,NonultraAndu,Next Year's Training and Race Calendar,"It's that time of the year when I want to plan what's next, and I am in serious need of advice.

In 2019 I ran 3 marathons: 2 trail marathons and one road (plus some additional half marathons). I have ran one road marathon and a half marathon the year before, so my experience is quite limited when it come to training. In terms of training I started last year with the [REI Marathon Trail Run Training Plan](https://www.rei.com/content/dam/documents/pdf/expert-advice/marathon-trail-running-plan-printable.pdf); it went great and I was quite satisfied with the result, but I had difficulties planing how to proceed with the training in order to better run the next races. I therefore had worst results on my next marathons than on my first ones.

For next year I want to run my first ultra and I managed to register for Lavaredo Ultra Trail - Cortina Trail (50K race).

Now I'm trying to find the best **solution** and the easiest would be to get a coach to help me with the planning, but how to do it? The ones I found, want you to pay a subscription and I'm not sure I want that for a year; I'm not that big of a runner  so I feels a bit extreme. I think I could use some strategies for improving my running as well, so yeah, getting a coach sounds even better.

Another option would be to try to make my one training plan, but I am afraid that I'm not that experienced yet (considering this year didn't go that grate).

What would be your recommendations or tips: do I need a coach's  help? How to choose one? How do I tackle the nutrition plan? Are websites like Training Peaks helpful when it comes to these year long plannings?

Ultramarathon,chad311,I have mastered the art of super long slow and steady running – but that is all I can do. I have completely plateaud as an ultramarathon runner. I will do anything to break through my glass ceiling.,"I got into running when I was already over 30 years old as a way to lose weight. This slowly morphed into doing Ironman Triathlons, which slowly evolved into running ultra marathons. Each and every one of my PR’s in Triathlon and ultra-running has come when I was training for a distance that was very intimidating and lit a fire under me that really motivated and pushed me. My first 100-mile ultramarathon only took me 22 hours and my first Ironman Triathlon I finished in a little over 12 hours. I have never been able to beat those PR’s despite thousands and thousands of miles and hours of running. I want to make this year different. I will do anything to break out of the mold I am in. 

I have been running lots of trail ultramarathons for about 5 years now. I have done about ten 100-mile or longer events and lots of other ultramarathons of all shapes and sizes. The 100-milers have been in the form of brutal mountainous terrain with over 20k feet cumulative ascent and descent (IMTUF four times) and several 24-hour timed flat-as-a-pancake races. 

I am 36 and weighing about in at about 175lbs I am not really built for speed (5’11’’). I have found the ultra-distance races to be where I feel the best because my body type doesn’t hold me back and I can more than compensate for not being super light with mental toughness over the long-haul of these super long races. I love doing these super long races, honestly, and the journey it takes to prepare for them physically and mentally is something that I enjoy as much as the races themselves.

My training is very simple, which is why in large part I believe I have hit a plateau. Basically my training is just to run as many miles in a week as I can. Over the summer I will be logging sometimes 70 – 80 miles. I only run once per day, I have never crossed the threshold into two-a-days. Like I said before, I don’t really do anything fast or speed training wise, I just love to hit the road and not come back for about 3 hours which usually translates into about 15 or 16 miles for me. I can basically run like this non-stop, but can’t do much more than this (looooong runs at slow and steady pace). I can do 12 min miles for days…..and nothing else.",1575576642
Ultramarathon,personanonymous,2021 for my first Ultra?,"So I am planning to run a 50 miler in 2021.

Ultramarathon,Jpandjcfol,Formula to convert max running distance to max walking distance?,"Hi,

I am training for a half ironman for next year but I also want to do a 100km walking competition in August 2020.

I am wondering if I can train by running for the walking event or if I really need to train by walking.

And if I can train by running, I am wondering if there is a sort of formula that could help me estimate when I will be ready.

Ex.: if max running distance = 50km then max walking distance is 100km

I understand that it’s not that simple and that the comparison will never be 100% accurate but I am looking for a rule of thumb/proxy to help me add some clarity to my training program.

I know the ratio is not 100% because some friends who did finish the 100km walking competition would never be able to run for 100km (not even a marathon imo).

Anyone can help me estimate this?

Many thanks in advance",1574944789
Ultramarathon,marshall_parr,Advice for running my first 24 Ultra with a difference!,"TLDR: Training for my first 24 hour run, looking for suggestions on how to best focus my training.

I  will be running my first 24 hour ultra called Convergence ([https://www.convergence.run/](https://www.convergence.run/)) next May, so no time like the present to get a solid plan in place to get prepared.

It's not a conventional ultra, as it's 24 hours to run as far as possible from any chosen starting location and route. All runners are given a tracker and essentially the winner is the person which runs the furthest distance (as the crow flies), all finishing at the same location a maximum of 24 hours later.     

It's a self supported race (i.e No Aid Stations) since the route I chose is completely optional. I will be looking to cover around 75 miles at least which will get me a gold medal (60 miles+ as the crow flies).

I am currently running around 140 miles a month, with my furthest ultra to date being 36 miles in just over 6 hours. I have ran 4 ultras around the 30+ mile mark this year, so I feel I have a fairly good base to pick-up my distance next year. 

Can anyone recommend what kind of preparations I should be doing for this? I don't currently follow a plan, running a couple of shorter 8 mile runs 2 or 3 times in the week + a long run at the weekend (ranging from anything between 15 miles - up to 30 depending on how much time I have).

I am conscious that I need to increase both milage and time on feet to prepare for the event, but I am also wary of overtraining, so I'm not quite sure how to strike the right balance whilst training.

Any help would be appreciated :)",1574871864
Ultramarathon,williamcrumbunds,Suddenly - L/R Calf Tightness,"Some context - I don’t believe this is injury related. I’m an experienced runner - 10 years, last ultra was in July, typically running around 25mpw outside of training cycle. 

The problem - I’m suddenly experiencing extreme muscle tightness in both my left and right lower calves simultaneously after about .75-1 miles, by mile two it’s preventing me from continuing my run. After 10 minutes of walking it off, 75% of the tightness is gone, no residual pain or tightness after 24 hours. I took a week off, used ice and compression, no effect. 

A month ago I had a solid 100 mile month, and felt great. Things that haven’t changed since then, my diet or hydration, warm up routine, shoes (180 miles into my third pair of shoes I love and typically put 400+ miles on), pace, or running surface.

Ultramarathon,runnyrunnerrunning,"Completed My First Ultra. Background, Training, Race Comments and Post Race Aftermath Below.","Two days ago I ran the White Rabbit Ultra Marathon in the Yellow Mountains, China. Total distance 60km, total ascent 2,800 meters. I finished with a time of 10 hours 42 minutes.   

**Background:** 

Seven years ago I was quite fit and really enjoyed running. I did a few sprint distance triathlons, I finished ToughGuy twice in the top 10%, did a few cross country races and would run a half marathon most weeks; I think my best time was around 1 hour 40 minutes. I went on some longer runs but I never measured the distance probably somewhere between 30k and 40k, I just enjoyed running. I developed some knee and Achilles’ tendon pain. I moved to China and sadly completely got out of the habit for sport and started to drink and smoke quite a lot. 

I turned 30 a few months ago and missed the feeling of being strong and fit. I ran 3 10ks over 2 and a half weeks but my knees got a little sore ( I know I ran far too much too soon) so I got my old bike sent over because I thought it would be kinder on my joints. I did some interval sprints a couple of times a week for a month and joined some long group rides. Quickly my fitness and strength came back stronger than ever on the bike. Last month I was riding 100 miles solo quite comfortably. 

I followed the link in a cycle group to a running event with the options for 5k, 30k and 60k. As soon as I saw it I knew I had to try the 60k trail run. I approached it with the attitude of not thinking I would finish but being disappointed if I didn’t. More than wanting to finish the event I just wanted to see what my body could do, I knew it would hurt, I knew I might get injured; I just wanted to see what I would do standing in front of these circumstances. I also wanted to see how much it would hurt in a strange kind of way. 

**Training:** 

I live in Shanghai, it’s flat as a pancake so I didn’t really know how to prepare for the ascent. There are also no trails. Additionally I was afraid of hurting my knees and Achilles’ tendon again so I didn’t want to run too much. I thought it’s better to have the injury on the event and pull out than not get there at all.

I continued with my cycling to improve my fitness. I told myself I would run up and down the stairs in my apartment building but I never did. I did a 120km ride and then a 10k run to simulate running on tired legs and I also did one 5k sprint in the morning and another in the evening to try and simulate running on worn-out muscles. I ran one 10k quite slowly. Lastly I tried to improve my diet. That’s the entirety of my training...and it gets worse... last weekend was my wedding. Some of my friends and family came to attend my wedding so for the last two weeks I had been drinking and smoking ( I used to smoke a lot but for the last 3 years I’ve only smoked while drinking) and my training completely stopped. I did; however, walk a lot, over two weeks I think I walked about 100km showing friends and family around Shanghai.

I know running a 60k with a 2,800 ascent with this little training and knowing that my knees where not really prepared is utterly stupid but something in me just wanted to do it. I told myself if I start to feel like I’m getting injured I would stop. I just wanted to run into the unknown and if I had done more training and entered an event at a later date I wouldn't have scratched that itch.

**The gear:** 

I bought some 5L Chinese brand running backpack with a 2L water bladder. From a popular outdoor shop I bought a walking pole, wait strap with pouch and water bottle holder, two knee compression things and loads of energy gels. I bought some long swimming shorts because I used to run in them before and they completely stop my thighs rubbing. I used my cycling shirt because it had pockets on the back I could put my rubbish. I had ordered some popular brand trail running shoes but they didn’t arrive in time so I ran on my super soft soled, no grip, old running shoes I had had for a few years ( but I hardly ever used them so still kinda new). 

**Race day:** 

Around 150 people had signed up for the 60k. As I waited by the start I didn’t have many thoughts, I didn’t really know what to expect, only that it will hurt at some point, and then we were off...  


My race strategy was to take on nutrition every 30 minutes with 250ml of water, sip from my water bladder regularly  and only stop at the rest points if I had to. I wanted to run at about 70-80% effort on the flats speed walk with 80-90% effort on the ascents (I really enjoy going up and I can recover quite quickly, something I learned when I used to do hill sprints all those years ago) and recover on the descents (I'm awful at descending).

I felt great at the 26k point. I’d done the majority of the ascent and didn’t feel tired or sore. I My legs felt great, I was in really high spirits. The steps to the top just seemed to be designed for my stride length; I was loving life. I was really looking forward to getting to the 30k mark and being able to be half way in such a good position. My pace was good and at this point in the race I was in 40th place.   


Then it started to get difficult. The 30k point just didn't seem to arrive, the terrain started to get really rocky and my feet started to hurt. I still felt good but it was really frustrating not being able put the power down through my feet. The terrain was really inconsistent which was making it impossible to get into any type of rhythm. I would say the prevailing emotion I felt between 30 and 40k was just frustration. It hurt a bit but only a bit of discomfort, the checkpoints were coming so slowly. I was also a lot worse at descending than I thought I would be; I had no faith that my legs would hold my weight as I stepped forward and down and descending hurt my feet considerably more that the flat or uphill sections. Strangely I was still golden uphill, as soon as there was some ascent I was running confidently.

&amp;#x200B;

40k arrived and for the first time I had the feeling that I might actually finish this race. The cut off time was 13 hours so I had 6 hours to finish the last 20k. I decided that if I was going to finish I wanted to finish comfortably so I had a long rest at this checkpoint. There was a medic at the 40k check point and told him that my feet hurt. He applied some cooling spray to my feet and gave them a massage. I showed him where my feet where hurting but he said that there didn't seem to be anything wrong. He did tell me that my blisters were getting bad and if they got any worse I should consider pulling out of the race. I had expected blisters and bought some climbing tape along with me which stopped them getting worse. I also took the time  to take on some solid food. I ate a tiny bit of chicken &amp;  drank  the broth. Also, the medic and people at the checkpoint were quite happy to see a foreigner (especially one that can speak Chinese). We all gathered together and took photos. I left the checkpoint feeling really happy despite my feet being in quite a lot of pain. After all this I dropped down to 58th place.  


About 10 minutes later the mind games started. 40k originally gave me such happiness and belief that I could finish because I only had 20k left. Then my brain started telling me. 

***""You've still got 1/3 to complete. 1/3 is not that different to 1/2. you've got to do all this again and it's mostly downhill. You hate downhill. and your feet really hurt.""***

I firmly told my brain out loud.  


***""You can fuck right off, fuck off, shut up, fuck off!""***

I didn't really have any other negative thoughts from my brain after that. 

I tried to listen to some music. I had prepared a playlist as I thought I would have my earphones in the majority of the way (When I solo cycle and run I always listen to music). A couple of songs gave me goose bumps and some really euphoric feelings but I felt like music was disturbing my rhythm and I was enjoying the atmosphere around me so I took my earphones out after about 10 minutes.   


After I had quickly hobbled down the last of the decent I was feeling in pain but OK; nothing too bad. I ran few km on the flat and refrained from walking until I had my soul destroyed by 3 runners. One of the runners was a lady who was walking 30 meters and then running 10 and repeating. She very slowly overtook me and disappeared. At the time I felt like she was not competing with the spirit of the event, she should run! I know that what she was doing was a legitimate strategy, I don't know why it upset me so much. The other two runners rested and or walked slowly until I caught up with them and then they ran off into the distance. They did this again and again for about 5km. This upset me. I felt beaten and walked for about 2km before starting a slow run again. Not long after that I saw the couple ask for a lift on a little three-wheeled flatbed motorbike. I watched them climb on and ride off. About half an hour later I caught up with them. They were standing next to the trike and seemed to act a little awkwardly. I thought about telling them I saw them get on the trike but I didn't want to assume they were cheating so I said nothing. Maybe they were injured and besides, it's got nothing to do with my race.   


50k arrived. In the pre-race pack it was stated that the trail would close at 20:30; however, on the 50k marker it said that the finish line closed at 18:30. I asked and I thought someone said if I don't cross the finish line before 18:30 I wouldn't get a finishers medal (my Chinese is good but I still frequently make mistakes). This meant that I only had 1.5 hours to run 10K. To put this into context, the fastest I had ran 10k the month before was 1 hour and 14 minutes, on smooth roads. Now it was getting dark (sunset is around 17:45 here) and the trail was twisting through bamboo forests, muddy tracks, streams and rivers. 

I dug deep. really deep. I concentrated on my running technique, keeping good posture, lifting my knees and ignoring the pain. Spectators on the route were surprised to still see someone running. They gave me encouragement.   


Someone told me there was only 2km left. After hearing that I couldn't run anymore. I though I had enough time, but the finish line was nowhere to be seen. Another person asked me if I could see the lights in the distance as that was the finish line. It seemed more than 2km away so I had to start running again. The trail twisted and turned through fields of long grass, it was pitch black and I could only just make out the way markers by the reflecting light off my head torch. I was on the wrong side of the river and there was no sign of a bridge. I had to really really dig deep and run. I was almost running in a panic. Then a bridge suddenly appeared. Policemen started shouting and shining their lights at me. They where telling me to run with them. They were telling me the finish line was 40 meters away. I said out loud I would finish and still didn't quite believe it. Moments later I crossed the finish line at 18:16 and cried. 

**The aftermath:**  
The next day my left foot was bruised and swollen and really painful. I had an X-Ray taken and thankfully there were no stress fractures, just some soft tissue damage. 

Two days after I still can't walk. Every muscle in my legs hurt. 

My knees and Achillies' tendons are fine.  


**What's next?**

I want to run another ultra, probably go a further distance in the future, but I don't want to hurt like this again. When I can walk again I will begin a proper training program and build up to the distance.

Ultramarathon,FCOLYKILoveYou,Who Wants To Help Me Do the Impossible?,"Hi guys, if you were going to attempt a 100 mile race in 12 weeks what would your plan of attack be? It's probably going to end in a crash and burn failure and is dangerous and overall crazy but for personal reasons i'm going to attempt it anyway so any advice focused on increasing the changes would be extremely appreciated. Current fitness levels: very healthy weight and i've been extremely diligent about diet and lifting weights for about 2 years. A month ago I ran a marathon without any training in 7 hours, and i've been running about 28 miles a week for the last two weeks. At the cutoff pace for the marathon had no problem from heart or lungs or muscles (just tightness after about 20 miles) No blisters or injuries at all from marathon was just pretty sore for two days. Used to run cross country and believe my form is overall pretty good but will have a running coach double check in the next week just to be sure.  


For long runs is it more important to always stay on your feet or is it fine to split up the run some throughout the day or rest some? Not sure if that is a trade off between trying to keep my legs healthy (stretching making sure things don't get tight) vs doing continous non-stop runs. Is it more advised to go slowly simulating race pace and mostly focus on the miles (the pace for a 30 hour finish is like 3.3 mph which is not fast a struggle, i'm aware it's going to be insanely mentally tough to keep that pace up for so long however).

Ultramarathon,rsch,Help me survive Northface California,"I'm signed up for my first 50 miler in a few weeks, my training plan has gone to hell, and the midwest is flat.  I'm terrified.

Was very consistent with my 'average finish' training plan all summer up through a 50k in mid September (finished 6hrs, just barely faster than middle of the pack).  Since then there's been lots of fall travel and family commitments, plus the 50k killed my excitement for running 50k + 20 miles which has all led to big swings in weekly mileage.

In addition, the course profile looks rough. I've done a few days on the treadmill simulating one or two of the 10ish climbs with jump squats to help with the downhill.  I actively seek out hills but it's not enough.  50-75ft per mile for everyday runs.  An hour drive for once a week long run can usually get me 200ft per mile but nothing like the monster climbs in California (1,000 ft per 2.5 miles nonstop).  

Speaking of long runs, they've gotten neglected and are now mostly every other week (20-23 miles) at a 14 minute pace followed up with 10 miles the next morning.


Average weekly mileage for the past few months has been:

65 miles Oct Week 4 (expected, w/26 mile long run)

28 miles Oct Week 3

58 miles Oct Week 2

21 miles Oct Week 1

6 miles  Sep Week 4

12 miles Sep Week 3

47 miles Sep Week 2 (50k)

31 miles Sep Week 1

51 miles Aug Week 4

49 miles Aug Week 3

Ultramarathon,alpine_murse,Loss of Motivation (more of an aimless rant/ needing encouragement),"Im a climber and runner, I love moving fast and light in the mountains, it gives you freedom to see so many things. I can upon the realization that I wanted to run ultras when I saw a dude summit Mt. Baker in a morning and what usually took people 2-3 days. 

While deployed I ran to cope and relieve stress. I trained and went from bilateral stress fractures to running my first ultra, a 50 miler in the beautiful forests of Oregon. Running that ultra was truly eye opening to me, and was a very emotional closure for me to deployment. I was alone for 12 beautiful hours, I laughed, I cried out of gratitude to be on American soil and surrounded by people tht genuinely cared about you, and I suffered for something good. I finished the race and had an amazing time. Shortly after I summited Mt. Shasta in a morning and it was an amazing experience. It was a lifelong dream come true.

I took a month off and started CRNA school. I decided another 50 miler wasn't possible but a 50k was. I trained my heart out, doing a majority of my miles on the dreaded treadmill. It kept me grounded and sane. CRNA school is no joke and I feel like pulling my hair out at times; it is extremely stressful and everyone is shooting to do well. 

I strained a ligament in my LCL. Have a knee brace on, and now I can't run, bike, hike, or climb. My stress outlet is gone.

Ultramarathon,linked2090,Finished my first 55k ultra! (Whistler Alpine Meadows),"The run was quite long and challenging - I came in at just over 11 hours and accumulated around 9000 feet of vertical. 

The first hour of the run was in darkness and rain with rain continuing for the first 9 hours (or so) of the run. It started at the base of Whistler mountain, with an immediate climb up to the glacier. After descending the mountain, there was about 10 miles of mountain bike trails that we ran on which was probably the hardest part of the 55k due to being tired from the glacier climb and decent, and the trails being quite muddy from the rain and having lots of ups and downs, and switching directions frequently.

I think one of the best parts of the race was the first of the three aid stations and they had fresh pancakes! The views from the glacier and subsequent decent were fantastic as well despite today being rainy. 

It was a great run to complete! 

My longest run before this was the Buckin' Hell 30k which is put on by the same organizers, and I spent around 5 months training for the 55k which included around two or three 5-7 mile runs per week, and a long run every second weekend which I built up to around 4 and a half hours on trails. I also went to the gym and did at least one day a week with squats, deadlifts, and lunges. About 2 months before the 55k I started doing some weekly mountain runs as well which were 2500 ft of ascent over 1.8 miles (BCMC trail on Grouse Mountain). 

Very happy to have completed the run! Hopefully will try for something like a 100k next year",1569211860

Ultramarathon,makebaloney,Rebecca Mountain 50 Miler Race Report,"  

“What’s this in your bottle?”

“It’s Tailwind.”

“But why is there just the powder in there?”

“I forgot to fill it up back at Rebecca Mountain Tower (mile 24.5). I was too excited that I finally made it to my drop bag and ran out of the aid station without refilling anything.”

That was when I knew I would at least finish the race. From the start of the race at Pointer’s Gap trailhead I knew it was going to be hot all day. I got warm right away on the short, mile-long out and back that they send us on to spread out the pack before getting back on single track trail under the trees. I slept well the night before after a nice pizza (yes, the entire pizza) at Pizza &amp; Pint downtown, but I didn’t really wake up until I smelled rotting flesh near the turn around of the out and back. 

“I never thought throwing up in the first half mile of an ultra was an option,” I mentioned to a nearby runner who I caught gagging. I guess dead animals right on the trail can do that to you. 

Once I got into the woods and on the trail, I was fully awake, checking my watch to see the time so I could start my hydration and nutrition before the heat took too much out of me. The first few miles were easy; a quick line of people shuffling within a few feet of each other, making sure that they weren’t going out to quickly on a sure-to-be treacherous half day trek. Spirits were high between runners, each of us sharing stories of hot summer runs and our excitement for a cool fall (which has still not shown up). Many of the people were chatting about their previous runs on the Pinhoti trail, their successes and failures of during the Pinhoti 100, and the next Pinhoti 100 that was only two months away. I missed the option to sign up, but all the stories and the nice morning weather had me wishing I was brave enough. 

We passed a Jeep right in the middle of the trail and saw a couple guys in kayaks in the mountain pond attempting to kayak fish. They probably didn’t expect a train of nearly one-hundred runners to come by but didn’t seem too bothered by our conversations on what they probably assumed would be a quiet morning in the woods catching largemouth.

Right after we passed them, we made a hard left and the climbing started. The east coast isn’t known for its gradual switchbacks, but its straight-up-the-hill pushes. Luckily, this trail was switchback after switchback of gradual climbing; about 2,000 ft. in a mile or two. This is where the crowds started to stretch out, and the aid station at mile 6 was the last place until 40 miles in that I would run right next to someone. 

I hit the first aid station, topped off my nearly empty hydration pack, and had some orange slices, a popsicle, and a PB&amp;J that I carried in each had for the next mile or so. I thanked everyone and took off, mostly alone for the next six miles to the second aid station. Now that I had made it to the top of the biggest climb, I knew I’d be running on the ridge of Rebecca Mountain for the next 20+ miles. What I didn’t realize was how tough the trail would be. I was spoiled by the wide, groomed switchbacks on the way up, but most ordinary day hikers turn around once they reach the top. That meant that the rest of the ridge would be a rocky, rooted, and overgrown jog of up-and-down-the-hill running. 

Miles 6-15 have blended together in my mind since I finished. Besides the normal photo-op at the top of the peak where I pulled out my GoPro and got a selfie, it was all easy running and taking it easy trying not to slip on the rocks that were scattered on every single part of the trail. I was loving how good I felt and assumed everyone else was feeling good too. At 11:30 in the morning, right at mile 16, I realized I was in the minority of high-spirited runners. I passed a friend from home that was looking pretty hot, asked her how she was doing, and listened to her displeased grunt at the humidity and heat. Less than 30 seconds later I heard her throwing up, yelled back to see if she was ok, and she sent me on my way. 

At the mile 18 aid station (3rd one) I met a friend that decided I could join them, so I’d have a crew (Thanks, Taylor).

“Hey, I passed her at mile 15 and she didn’t look good. Super hot. Throwing up. She’s probably 20 minutes or so behind.”

“No worries, the others are only about two minutes ahead of you. If you could slow down a bit, I’d appreciate it. I’m only able to get about three beers in between each aid station for you guys and I’d like to be more in the 4-5 range.”

“Perfect. I will keep that in mind next time I decide I feel like sprinting.”

To my surprise, my friend came running in about two minutes later, looking better now that she cleared her stomach of whatever it was that was messing her up. I took off and let our crewing buddy help her out, thinking I’d see her somewhere between this aid station and the drop bags. Unfortunately, that was the last time I would see her on the trails, and it was the beginning of the end of the day for at least half of the runners. 

Miles 18-25 were the worst for most of the people. This was the first part of the race where I saw people going backwards on the trail, back toward the previous aid station since it was closer than continuing on to the halfway point. I don’t blame them at all. It was getting hot. High 90’s and super humid under the overhanging trees. I was still surprised at how good I was feeling. I started passing a few people, going back and forth with a couple runners, and started noticing a huge difference between the runners feeling ok and the ones that weren’t. From mile 20 on it was pretty easy to see who would continue past the tower aid station and who wouldn’t. 

I got to my drop bag, restocked on Ziplocs of Tailwind, grabbed my headlamp, and took of my shoes to inspect my feet. I felt like I had a couple heel blisters coming on, but my feet looked pretty good (as good as a person running 25 miles in 95-degree heat could, at least). I changed socks and took off. 

Two miles after the aid station, at about 2:00 pm, I went to take a sip and got a mouth full of powder. No water. Bone dry. Here I was in the hottest part of the day, no nutrition, no water. I was too far to turn back, so I decided to keep on going until I got to the next aid station. The trail was now a steady decline under the trees as I ran down the far side of the ridge. How bad could it be?

Well, bad. Halfway between the fourth and fifth aid station there is a brutal climb that is pretty exposed to the sun. It is probably only a quarter of a mile or so long, but at 3:30 in the afternoon with no water, I was struggling hard to take each step. That quarter mile felt longer and tougher than any part I had run so far and any part I would run after. 

By the time I made it to the 5th aid station I was dehydrated. I knew that I had made it there with no water during the hottest part of the day, so it could only get better from here. I took more time at the 5th aid station than any other, eating everything I could see and drinking cup after cup of water. After 15 minutes I took off, running a 7 mile stretch of gravel road that seems to continue forever and ever and ever. I was passed by two runners running together in the first half mile of the seven, and then I didn’t see anyone else for over two hours. I felt like I was on that road for days. Physically I was feeling a lot better, but the mental drag of that road was terrible. A mile from the end of the road, where you finally get back onto trails near Lake Howard, I got passed by a dirty Honda Civic. A dude in a wife beater and his wife wearing the same stopped next to me as I ran up. 

“What kind of marathon is this, man?”

“It’s a trail race out here in the middle of nowhere on these trails. There’s probably 40-50 of us left out here.”

“How far ya’ goin?”

“50 miles. It sucks.

“Yeah, F\*ck that man. Good luck.”

“Thanks.”

He shook up the dust as he drove off, and soon after I was back on single track, thankful to at least be in the park where the finish was. I was starting to get chaffed and it was getting dark. I figured I hadn’t seen anyone in a few hours, so there was no better time than now to get the Vaseline out of my pack and lube up everything between my knees and my belly button. I was feeling good and pulled out my headlamp, trying to turn it on. I pushed the button, and nothing happened. It was completely dark by now and I remembered that I had put one of my batteries in backwards on purpose so that it didn’t accidentally get turned on in my pack. I took it off and tried to get the battery out to flip it around, but my slimy hands from my crotch-work were no help at all. I was digging on the trail for a stick to pry the battery out and realized how foolish I must look. I couldn’t help but burst out in laughter. It was probably my favorite part of the race.

Mile 35 ish-50 are all in the park near Lake Howard. It is a windy, freshly groomed mountain bike trail, and it wasn’t on the mountain anymore, so there was very little climbing, descending, or fancy footwork required. At this point it was all mental because you can often hear the cheering from the finish line or the music at the aid station that you hit twice during the last loops. I put my headphones in for the first time to get myself in the zone and ran in the dark for the next three hours. The first time I saw another runner was about 200 yards from the finish. We linked up, walked in together, and were silently thankful that it was all over. It was a great day, a tough race, had amazing volunteers, and was my first 50 miler. Perfect.",1569003163

Is it feasible for me to take a week or two off, to let my minor injury heal? I’m nervous about taking too much time off, since this week and next should be my peak mileage weeks.

I started to have some trouble in August, when my long runs started to turn into 3+ hour jaunts.  Additionally, I got busy at work (I'm a resident physician in emergency medicine) and between taking call, getting called in for surgeries, and then doing a string of late shifts, followed by night shifts, followed by morning shifts, and trying to take care of my wife and young child I have absolutely hit the wall.  I'm physically a wreck right now.  My circadian rhythm is so screwed up I'm waking up at 2am every night with my heart pounding and cortisol raging because I think I'm supposed to be at work.  Mentally I'm hanging in there but physically I'm shredded.

Right now I'm struggling to drive home from work without falling asleep at the wheel and the thought of me running 50k right now is ludicrous.  I've gained maybe 6 pounds in the last month.  I feel like utter garbage.  Even as I write this at 4:30 PM, I'm struggling to stay awake.

Ultramarathon,lorenlorenson,Race Report - SouthCoast Challenge 100KM,"**Preface**

This was the first race I have ever done. Race. Not ultra. I have never done a park run, 5k, 10k, Marathon, Ultra or anything.... I've done a lot of running alone, but never with people. So, an interesting challenge.

**DONE:** Attempt to complete the course between 16 to 20 hours.

**Training**  
I've been a cyclist so I went into running a couple of years ago with a reasonable fitness base. I found that running hit a lot of other muscle groups though. Fast forward, I started running longer distances and got into a regular weekly routine of hitting 25+ miles a week with no goal. I started listening to ultramarathon podcasts (M-runs, Science of Ultra) and was intrigued by the idea of going long.

I started to build up to 40 miles a week as a base, and I signed up for the challenge. I topped out at 60 miles a week on terrain that was identical to the course. In fact I've trained on half of it and up other rivers to get a sense of how the trails play out. However, my longest runs in training were only about 21 miles and around 4 hours in length. I would back out of going longer on ""out and back"" loops. This left me a bit worried about how to handle the whole distance. Still, by the time I got to my 2-week taper it was a bit late. So I had to deal with it. I'd been running 40+ miles a week for over a year with several 60s approaching the race date.

**Pre-race**  
No sleep. I had tapered and I was stressed. I had about 4 hours sleep the night before the big day. I woke up a little bit tired and anxious.

**Race**  
[Set off early in the morning](https://goo.gl/maps/nii2YMXVHkD7Q7CU6). I heeded the advice I had listened to and read: go out slow, walk the uphills, run the flats. I did this. Going up [Beachy Head](https://goo.gl/maps/SnKU9TiBLBBiEi3N8) and across the first 23km of cliffs was a bitch. Great scenery as I hadn't run this end of the course and it felt new. Lucky enough to get away with the grass being dry as my Mizuno's aren't waterproof (wide and neutral for my flat hairy Hobbit feet, but not weather resistant!). The next section went from [Alfriston](https://goo.gl/maps/EV1JMYNbb8QYCcr67) up and over the South Downs toward [South-Ease](https://goo.gl/maps/hQFx5vanV6vxwa3QA). This part was pretty uneventful. Prior to the race I decided I needed something to listen to, so I chose an audio book that lasted a good 14 hours. I got three hours into it and turned it off. Love the author, love his voice, but not for that long! I started to run for the first time ever without a soundtrack and it was nice.

South-Ease aid station saw me change my socks. BEST DECISION EVER. Take spare socks and change them, even if the old ones are dry. Lovely sensation. Between South-Ease and [Brighton RaceHill](https://goo.gl/maps/XbCkiVcRwTWjz4ox8) became a mentally dark place. Most of it was against the wind and whilst it was (only) 500ft elevation gain over 6-ish miles it felt heavy. Especially as the scenery to the North didn't change significantly (there is a [chalk-face outside the town of Lewes](https://goo.gl/maps/kXtyhDPu2gFNAcKaA) that is easy to spot, which never went out of sight).

Approaching Racehill and down into Brighton is around 30 miles. That felt significant in my mind. I've never run a marathon so the 26.2 miles thing wasn't hanging over me. I'd beaten my training mileage so the next stop was down in [Hove Park](https://goo.gl/maps/W9SqFyGMjk2KATUo8) happy I'd just tipped the half way point realising as I did that anything over 26.2 is ultra territory and I was now 'technically' an ultra runner/hiker/jogger/person. From here on out I had experience with the route, terrain and everything. I knew where I was going and what to expect. W00t.

Coming out of Hove Park it started to rain, so out came the jacket, which promptly went back in my bag as it was too warm and the weather had stopped being rubbish.

This section of the course became harder mentally, but not because of the wind. You see, coming out of Eastbourne there was a bit of a party atmosphere. The weather was fine, it was hot, everyone was excited. There were lots of runners, lots of joggers, lots of walkers. There was a mix of people doing the full 100k (1 and 2 day affairs), half the course and a quarter course. This all dropped off after Hove. It was like the party ended as I headed up (alone) to [Devil's Dyke](https://goo.gl/maps/wAR5TaL6U4Tf9Fwi7).

The section between Devil's Dyke and [Beeding/Bramber](https://goo.gl/maps/9XRZSgsPbjcFRrYbA) was a no-brainer. Mostly trail, some long grass (this was the first point in the day my shoes had got a bit wet, but it was not an issue overall), and a couple of miles of tarmac road. The [Peartree Cottage](https://goo.gl/maps/9XRZSgsPbjcFRrYbA) aid station saw another sock change and prepping of lights and glow-sticks. [Top of the next hill](https://goo.gl/maps/3UvJZRFDpRdHdMbJ7) (on the course map the path goes west, dog-legs and continues north), 2 miles before [Chanctonbury](https://goo.gl/maps/pamMEXHfRYAfxRndA) Ring the light failed. Sun went down, out came headlamp and hand torch (a late addition, just in case).

Off into darkness! To help chase off 'The Black Dog' and mental spiral into despair I returned to listening to my audiobook. A good move that helped me across several parts of the course. By [Windlesham School aid station](https://goo.gl/maps/6tFpuaEnhfaduRqw9) I had met a fellow runner. It was literally as we were approaching the tents. It was surprising that he too had never run a race and ""just decided"" to enter an ultra. We hung out for a little while and refuelled.

As it was dark and ominous outside, I suggested and we agreed to head out on the next section together. We kept each other's spirits up for the remainder of the race, which was really welcome. I think this section, whilst familiar, would have been a lot less ""fun"" alone.

A couple of miles out of Windlesham and there was a firework display from [a local club](https://goo.gl/maps/7UN2yV7rz1TKhMn28) situated in a valley. Load music and explosions in the dark was a great distraction until the hot fiery things came back down to the ground and set fire to wheat stubble that was in the field next to the trail! [The place lit up like you would not believe](https://imgur.com/UbXBOgF)! We got on the phone and called emergency services, [used what3words to give a location](https://goo.gl/maps/p41QtqJqpQQeDmNu7) and moved on. It transpired later that the trail had to be closed whilst the situation was managed.

[High Titton](https://goo.gl/maps/uuqVwZzDFnsRnqw39). It's near [Amberly](https://goo.gl/maps/yBt7ec1Z5PeSedC3A) and the next [aid station](https://goo.gl/maps/KUuLfgzkhnso1hmUA). It's a 600ft descent (approx) on loose chalk trail. After around 50 miles it sucked. it sucks running UP it, but sucks more going down the thing. the aid station was dead. We moved on down [a terribly thin trail that followed the river](https://goo.gl/maps/Vuxr18weHVh719AfA) to [the finish](https://goo.gl/maps/Q8vUSX7xjPZGpEgh6). It was now that everything really started hurting, shin splints, patella tendinitis, that one blister on my little toe. Meh. This part sucked. It felt that everything was too far away and that the organisers had put the KM markers out wrong and it felt that we were never going to get there. Thing is the course was marked out fine, we followed the reflective arrows and glow-sticks marking the way.

It was a plod. Not so much a death march, but a tired grumpy hike fuelled by the imposing dark and claustrophobic feel of being under so many over-hanging trees.

**The finish**  
""You want to run it? For pride""

""Hell yeah""

We got round the corner and broke into a sprint. It felt like a sprint but I later said we probably looked like a pair of tired old ladies trying to run round a supermarket. 100km done. ""bubbly"" and medal received. ""bubbly"" tasted and spat out. Finish area was virtually dead. Job done.

**Post-race**  
Got in the car and promptly went to get some coke Zero, I was fed up with drinking Keto-aid or coffee. When home I had a tablespoon or two of ""extra thick double cream"" and fell into bed. Next morning, after about 2 hours sleep, was time for a bath. I didn't eat much that day until the evening and even then my appetite was a bit off.

One thing happened that was weird. My gut had become bloated and misshapen, perhaps from too much immodium, keto-aid and rehydration powder? It has since returned to normal. It has been about 6 days, walking still hurts, but the one blister is a non-issue and it is really now only patella tendinitis that is hanging around. And a horrible exhausted ""can barely lift a pencil"" feeling. Because I can barely lift a pencil.

Recovery is in fits and starts as I am back at work. One thing I must mention is my exhausted state has left me coping with people less well. I'd rather recover alone, which I can't and that sucks. Something I hadn't accounted for.",1567877487
Ultramarathon,jollmar,What's your best tips for backyard ultras?,"Hi, first time poster here. 

I'm thinking about running a backyard ultra in Sweden next year. It will be my first time running an event of that type. Looking for tips as for how to train and tips regarding nutrition, tempo, and general stuff that is good to know.

As for some background: I've been running consistently for about 4 years. For the last year I've averaged about 40-50 miles per week and I plan to stay in that zone for the training period leading up to the race which will take place in june 2020.",1567760933
Ultramarathon,Surena430,Because ultra training takes a lot of time and isn't always possible. Thought some would find my experiences relatable,"I guess the hardest thing for me to adapt to is not training for hard shit for awhile. For the longest time ultra running and training was a cornerstone of my identity and now with my current schedule, 14-18 miles a week is the best I can manage. It’s disheartening when such an integral part of your identity needs to be put on hold in the pursuit of a goal. That goal is of course graduating from MSU Denver. Going from running 30-40 miles a week and competing at such a high level to running 14-18 miles a week and lacking that intensity is a difficult pill to swallow, especially for such a type A, driven person like me. Going from running Mount Morrison and Mount Falcon weekly to South Table, South Valley and Green Mtn is hard for me. Sometimes it feels like I will never get back to the version of myself that trained for and completed 50 milers, a 100k, 100 milers, and the Grand Canyon R2R2R. But I know I will.",1567696706

""You want to run it? For pride""

""Hell yeah""

&amp;#x200B;

We got round the corner and broke into a sprint. It felt like a sprint but I later said we probably looked like a pair of tired old ladies trying to run round a supermarket. 100km done. ""bubbly"" and medal received. ""bubbly"" tasted and spat out. Finish area was virtually dead. Job done.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Post-race**

Got in the car and promptly went to get some coke Zero, I was fed up with drinking Keto-aid or coffee. When home I had a tablespoon or two of ""extra thick double cream"" and fell into bed. Next morning, after about 2 hours sleep, was time for a bath. I didn't eat much that day until the evening and even then my appetite was a bit off. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing happened that was weird. My gut had become bloated and misshapen, perhaps from too much immodium, keto-aid and rehydration powder? It has since returned to normal. It has been about 3 days, walking still hurts, but the one blister is a non-issue and it is really now only patella tendinitis that is hanging around. And a horrible exhausted ""can barely lift a pencil"" feeling. Because I can barely lift a pencil.

&amp;#x200B;

Recovery is in fits and starts as I am back at work.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Good, Bad, Ugly**

**The good** stuff came down to me over-prepping and not changing things at the last minute. I had stuff I knew worked, I used it. I could rely on being comfortable, not hungry and not thirsty for the duration. 

That good feeling of getting half way there.

That good feeling of changing your socks.

That good feeling of completing a race in one piece.

&amp;#x200B;

**The bad?** Going against the wind.

The dark, the wind, the aid station nutrition.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ugly?** That dark place I managed to avoid with audio book and company. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **What Went Well?**

Shoes, gear choices, personal nutrition, carrying S Caps. Being alone for the first 3/4s of the race. Meeting someone in the closing stages.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti-chaffing solution: [https://www.metanium.co.uk/](https://www.metanium.co.uk/) This stuff (the yellow one) just DOESN'T come off, and I didn't get any rashes which was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **What Went... Not Well?**

\* \*\*Garmin\*\* I had to recharge my Forerunner 230 twice to get there. Disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Aid stations food, drink, electrolytes\*\*

I must gripe about this even though it is a hole I dug myself into. I did this keto. I have changed my way of eating and trained and run a 100km fat adapted. WITHOUT carbohydrate fuelling. I queried this and thought about swapping out my nutrition for the race but I was freaking out about my gut going AWOL on me an ruining the event. So, I carried some smoked belly pork and cheese for back up. Really. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had contacted the event organisers about food available as I was High Fat, Low Carb and they replied in vague terms. I got to each of the aid stations (and meal options) to be faced with fruit, candy/sweets, Coke, juice, donuts, cakes, pasta, chips/fries, ""vegan baked thing"" and pizza. It was not until the Windlesham aid station that hot dogs appeared, which were not welcome that far in as they tasted not great at that late stage. I prepped for this and packed my own fuel: Smoked Belly Pork. And body fat. I decided to see if I could do it fasted and failed. I had breakfast and started refuelling on the starting line, just in case! 

&amp;#x200B;

The belly pork kept me going, it was awesome. All in all, I consumed around 3000 calories for that entire day including breakfast, the pork, some black olives in Hove, gherkins and the post-race cream. Ouch. The keto-aid was a mix of salt and lo-salt that I kept in my bag. I topped up at each aid station when I got coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using S Caps was great, I stayed on top of my electrolytes just in case. I had no cramping, headaches, or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

My headlamp was a cheap POS from a supermarket. I want to get a better one for next time, luckily I packed a hand held LED torch for backup. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **What Would I Do Differently?**

Less stuff. I didn't need a change of clothes (other than socks). We were blessed with the weather so I didn't need my jacket. I over-thought the situation, bought hiking poles and never used them. However, if I hadn't taken them you know I'd have cursed myself for 100km wishing they were in my bag.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd spend a little less time at the half-way aid station. Though I really did benefit from about 40 minutes break.

&amp;#x200B;

A smaller bag next time. But not too small.

Maybe try introducing carbohydrates into the race in the second half to see if it helps with energy levels and mental health. I think that the tiredness played on my mental state a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **What’s next?**

IoW? [https://www.ultrachallenge.com/isle-of-wight-challenge/how-to-join](https://www.ultrachallenge.com/isle-of-wight-challenge/how-to-join) maybe a rest first though.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Gear used**

Mizuno wave rider 22 because 2e wide neutral for my hobbit feet,

Osprey 25L bag,

A 2L bladder on my back (it wasn't a major issue refilling etc),

Asics technical t-shirt over Uniqlo Airism base layer (it works for me),

Boxers over Uniqlo shorts (totally not running gear but no issues),

Nike running jacket (just in case),

Hiking poles (just in case),

Ultramarathon,igotherps,Couch to 161k - How feasible is this in less than 1 year?,"Hi folks!

I'll leave all the details out about how I came to this decision, but I've decided to try to run the Sinister 7 race Jul 3-5 of 2020. For context of where I am now, I'm a seasoned hiker when it comes to multi-day hikes, and I'm used to putting in multiple 20+km days with 50 pounds on my back. So I'm fortunate to have some decent hill-climbing muscles already, but more importantly, I understand what 161km looks like. I'm genuinely terrified at the thought of basically doing more than two West Coast Trails in about 15 hours, after hiking it in 5 days.

But my cardio is pretty awful. I just ran 3.7 km today to see how I'd feel, and my legs came out of that feeling depressingly rubbery. I had to stop three times for 15 second breathers during this run as well.

This course is also not to be trifled with. It's notoriously brutal for elevation gain (6400m across the whole course). I love hiking uphill compared to down as it's just so much easier on the knees, so the downhill portions are my major concern. I also want to avoid running at night as much as possible, for my own safety, so it works out to roughly 15 hours for me to complete 161km. That means maintaining 10.7 km/hr if I want to finish in that time.

It's been about 15 years since I ran seriously. I used to do a lot of cross country and I do have the body type for it - I'm 6'1 and lean. But that doesn't mean anything if I don't give 100% effort into training. 

Right now, my short term 2-3 week plan it just to jog every 2nd day, keeping it to 5km runs with as few breaks as possible. This is just what made sense to me since the most critical thing I need to do is be able to become comfortable with running again. In the meantime I'm working on a more formalized training plan, which will include major dietary changes, entrances into various trail runs, gym workouts, and uphill/downhill running.

If anyone has any words of encouragement, tips or advice for training, all is welcome. 

Oh, lastly, I should state my goals with this. I just want to finish it, kind of as a bucket list thing, while in the process work on my 'heart health'. I've had anxiety about my heart plaguing me since my dad had a heart attack, and I think being in good physical shape will be the best thing for my physical and mental health.",1567475000

Well, an inflamed synovial lining in the right knee and a burst disc in my back were right around the corner.  So, 2019 hasn't been too great for running.  I haven't been on the trails since February, so I was literally just resting and gaining weight.  I'm now down 15 pounds through keto and trying to strengthen my legs, even though surgery for my knee and back may be my only options.

Ultramarathon,wanna-b-runner,"I ran my first ultra marathon, less than 2 week notice, no running training.","About 2 weeks ago, I got this crazy idea I would run an ultramarathon. I ran a lot when I was in the Army, but haven't been an avid runner in about 6-7 years. The last 3-4 years I have been doing a lot of bike riding/ racing (no pro, pretty minor, entry level stuff). This past winter I ran a few times a month, and since April maybe 5 times. Otherwise I mostly just rode my bike. My previous longest run was last year (13.1 miles, in about 1hr and 50min.) Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I was binge watching Billy Yang Films youtube channel and thought, what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I saw a 6 hr endurance run being held about 8 miles away from me. I contacted the organizer, asked a few questions, and quickly realized this could be a great chance, on a beautiful course, with a lot of opportunity for aid if needed. The course was 3.7 mi loop on a break-wall into a lake. An aid station about half way  through. I figured I could run until I couldn't and worst case walk if I had to. Leading up to the race, in my head, I told myself I could get top 3. When the race started I found myself running closely with 2 others, chasing the guy in 1st. I was so excited. I thought for sure I would do very well. For the first 15 miles, I was neck and neck with another guy going for 3rd place. Shortly after, I fell apart. I walked for a few miles, took in fluids and fruit and some gummy bears. At mile 18 I ran again for about 4 miles. After that I was pretty wrecked, but only half way through the 6 hrs. I realized I had a giant blister on my left foot and some chaffing on my privates. (Cheap shoes/cotton socks/and walmart shorts with no support... mistake of my life) The rest of my race consisted of people passing me, and my doing this awkward run/walk situation. At 5.5 hours I was at 29.6 mi, I decided to go for one more lap (it didn't count if I didn't complete before the 6hr time limit. Just after starting the last lap I realized it wouldn't happen, I finished 9 laps, 33.3 mi, in 6.5 hours. The last 24 hours have been quite painful, sore muscles, blisters, and some bad chaffing. I'm glad I did this race, and it may have reignited my passion for running. We will see.

Ultramarathon,Ultra-Trex,Considering a 100? Good video to view,"As someone who is still reasonably new to Ultras I scour race reports and videos looking for ways people have successfully and unsuccessfully done the longer end of the spectrum.

My first 50k and 50m really really were a learning experience that forced me to certain realizations and luckily I took them to heart before going longer.  

It didn't take me long to validate my own conclusions based on my training and racing that pacing is the primary cause of DNF.  Virtually every other cause that's not accident related that makes a runner drop has a root cause in bad pacing.   

I just came across a runner on YouTube and  his video I think is so on point, it's such a quintessential definition of the learning experience that anyone who is thinking of making that leap from a 50mile to a 100mile should really watch and process this video. 

I 100% believe everyone who hasn't yet taken the leap from a 50 will benefit.  

I have no affiliation with this runner, YT today is the first time I've come across him and this is not some click bait or views scam.  

If you still don't want to go view it then just take this point away: Pacing, pacing pacing.  A 100 is not 50.  It's an entirely different beast that will take your complacency and chew it and you up.

I pitted for a couple of people this past weekend that did the Habanero 100 miler. It is a brutal 100 miles that starts at noon in 100 degree heat!

So when we took it off of his wrist and plug it in it reset. So all the data that was leading up to that point was lost. It's okay because we were only about 60 miles in, who cares about losing 60 miles of a run? And all the stats that come with it. The other Runner had a forerunner 235, which cost considerably less than the Fenix 5. She was able to charge the 235 while running and it continued to track her run.

Ultramarathon,MilosBurrito,Looking for feedback on my 50k Gameplan!,"Thanks for reading! 

I'm attempting my first 50k trail run, the Tamalpa Headlands 50k, this Saturday. I abruptly and spontaneously signed-up yesterday - the challenge and course seemed too epic to pass up. The Reddit running community has been so cool and helpful to me over the years, so I would be foolish not to leverage this resource! I appreciate any feedback, coaching, or insights y'all may have for me.

**Background**

* 31 year old Male with little trail running experience. Most of my running experience has been on roads. I just completed my first marathon, the San Francisco Marathon, about three weeks ago and ran a 3:46. My peak mileage week was 53 miles before a two week taper. After a week of a reverse taper, my weekly mileage returned to 38, then 41 last week. These weeks include long runs, tempo runs, race pace runs, and 800 meter repeats. I ran nine 20 mile training runs over about 12 weeks leading up to the marathon, including a 23 miler, and not including the marathon itself. I also lift legs (squats, leg press, calf raises, reverse leg curls) after my long runs. I feel confident that the distance is something I'm conditioned for, although the elevation change and trail terrain will be new to me. 

**Race Information**

* Tamalpa Headlands 50k - about 6,500 feet of elevation change. Weather looks to be clear, starting in the 50s and working its way to the 70s. Although in the Bay Area, nothing is certain from a weather standpoint.

**Gameplan**

* One strategy a fellow Reddit member recommended to me was to walk/power hike the elevation gain. Running in San Francisco has definitely helped my hill running, although this elevation profile is unlike anything I've challenged myself to.
* Switch focus from Pace to Effort and try to keep my heart rate below 150 in Zone 2 as long as I can.
* Take in 300 calories a hour via GUs, Cliff Bars, Kind Bars, and Aid Station food. I have no idea how long this will take me, so I'm planning for 6 hours of nutrition. That's 15 GUs, 4 Cliff Bars, 2 Kind Bars, and a Fruit Bar or two, assuming they fit in my vest. GU every 30 minutes, Cliff Bars on climbs, then additional food early and often, stomach willing.
* For hydration I have a 1.5L bladder in my race vest I'll fill with Liquid IV. I also have two 12oz Soft Flasks, but I'm unsure if I'll want those with me as well, or if the bladder is sufficient and those pockets can be for food.
* For my abrupt taper, the plan is 4 miles today (which felt pretty good), 4 miles tomorrow, then a 2-mile shakeout on Friday.
* I'm also planning to mix in a massage sometime this week, or maybe even compression boots. Can't hurt, right?

I'm basically going to tweak my marathon nutrition strategy, start slow, walk the climbs, use my already tested marathon gear, and do my best to mentally prepare for a longer day. I'm 50/50 on bringing headphones. The biggest areas of weakness I've identified, just by virtue of a lack of repetitions, will be the terrain, trail-running in and of itself, employing a longer winded fueling strategy, and the gnarly elevation gain. The biggest challenge will be mustering the strength to walk my dog when I get home.

All that being said, I'm super stoked to challenge myself and will greatly appreciate any advice!",1566270557

Ultramarathon,brian_stelter,Extra protection for a growing blister on achilles,"Hey folks,

I recently picked up some new shoes (Altra escalante) and have been getting along well. Only gripe (self-inflicted) is that I ran wearing some too-small ankle socks on day 1 and gave myself a good shiny blister on my Achilles.  Despite lengthy thick socks on subsequent days, this uneven blister does an excellent job of catching the shoe (even through the sock) and gets a larger, shinier, red face each run.

Understand that new shoes can bring new pains, but this issue is mostly on me for running around with my sock slid down my heel.

Understand this blister will callous given time, but I want to keep on doing stuff in these shoes.  Therefore, I would like to beef up blister protection, and am not sure if better to tape/moleskin the blister or add some sort of pad to the shoe.

I stood on a foot scanner at the shoe store and it detected the difference in arch height/size. 

Previous:

Now:
Left: 11, normal arch
Right: 12.5 some arch, but lower

Ultramarathon,P-dubbs,[Race report] Burning River 100 - My First Attempt at a 100 Miler,"### Preface
This is not the race report I was expecting to write. After a terrible year of injuries, almost no sustained training, no pacer, and no real plan, I was expecting a race report about bonking, suffering for many hours, and eventually quitting or timing out at my first 100. It was going to have a long list of lessons I learned and plans for how to do better next time and an appreciation for the opportunity, despite the disappointment. This, however, is not that race report. This is the race report in which I somehow pulled it off and finished the Burning River 100.

### Training
In a word, my training for this race was terrible. I’ve been injured in some way since January and haven’t had a decent training cycle all year. Going into Burning River, my longest run outside of races was 12 miles, and that was back in the spring. I completed the [Forget the PR 50K](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/bbpmay/race_report_forget_the_pr_50k_hit_the_wall_hard/) in April and Flying Pig 4-Way in May. I’ve been running some short, fast stuff this summer, but that’s about it. I did run a couple of 4-6 mile runs on the trails last week, so that’s gotta count for something, right?

### Pre-race
**Thursday**: Packed drop bags, went to REI for salt, gels, and an extra headlamp.

**Friday**: Made spaghetti, put my drop bags and race day stuff in the car, and drove my dogs from Columbus to Cleveland where they would be staying for the weekend. I got to the expo in Cuyahoga Falls at around 4pm and picked up my race stuff (bib, tights(?), Burning River Goodrs, race poster). I dropped off drop bags in the parking lot across the street and then grabbed a sandwich at a nearby restaurant and walked through a farmers’ market. There was a rules meeting at 5pm, after which I drove to my dad’s house (about 20 minutes away), had an early dinner, and was asleep by 9pm.

**Saturday**: Got up at 2AM, got dressed, left at 3am and drove to start. Ate a sofritas burrito bowl for breakfast while waiting for the start, and met up with a friend who was also running.

### Race
## Starting slow
[The Start](https://youtu.be/IjU6HAWrHXg)

I had planned on sticking with my friend for as long as possible, and we took it very easy from the start. The course went a mile or so from HiHo Brewing in Cuyahoga Falls to the Highbridge Trail. We ran across some sketchy wooden bridges along the gorge and then down a bunch of stairs to a trail along the Cuyahoga River. There was a short road section and then we suddenly found ourselves at the first aid station (Memorial Parkway). This aid station had Hammer gels and water. I grabbed an orange gel and skipped water since my pack was still mostly full. We ran on the [Towpath](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm) for a bit and through some really beautiful woods as the sun came up. There were some long downhills in this stretch that I knew would be killers on the way back, but I was feeling good and tried not to think about it. We went through the North Hawkins aid station and got some real food, and after another few miles of downhills and Towpath we arrived at the Botzum aid station (“Aloha” themed). I had some PBJs, candy, pretzels, and grapes, got my pack refilled, and left the aid station solo.

## Getting into it
[18 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/HopxgGwdzwU)

While running I distracted myself by stopping to pick up any trash I found on the trail. It stayed fairly cool in the morning and the course was beautiful. We ran on roads past the [Hale Farm Homestead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale_Farm_and_Village) and I saw my mom and mother-in-law at the covered bridge. They said they would see me at the aid station up the hill. There was some solid vert up to Oakhill aid station, but I don’t remember anything too crazy. I got a good boost from the boatload of volunteers, crews, and spectators that greeted me as I ran into Oakhill. There, I grabbed my drop bag and changed into a fresh shirt, ate some avocado toast, and headed out with a pack full of ice water.

## The Marsh of Misery
[28 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/d_3tlPZcH4g)

I don’t remember much of the trails in this section, but I do remember the Valley Picnic aid station (“Margaritaville” themed) because I heard one of the volunteers say they had just run out of popsicles :( I ran onto the Towpath again for a long, straight stretch to the Bolanz corn field. There were tons of people out biking on the towpath, and someone was shooting a shotgun in the fields somewhere (according to another runner from Tennessee, it’s dove season?). We entered the “Marsh of Misery”, which was really just a couple of muddy patches. The mud was pretty deep (over my shoes), but I ran through it and survived. After a few more miles of trail I arrived at Pine Hollow and picked up my second drop bag. I ate some cherries and potatoes and said hi to my uncle who had stopped by with food. I lanced a blister that had developed due to the wet trail and plunged back into the woods while eating a sandwich.

## Turning up the heat
[40 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/8TggpH7OCIs) and [42 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/rtpSECobNlk)

The course made a several-mile-long loop through the woods and came out at the bottom of the hill below the Pine Hollow aid station. I ran through the meadows full of wildflowers and climbed the “Sound of Music” hill. I felt like the foliage in the meadows held in the heat and I was suffering in the sun while climbing the hills. I got my water refilled at the Kendall Lake aid station and got back on the trails. After this section I ran past the [Ledges](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/the-ledges.htm), which is my favorite section of the course. It was cool and scenic on the trail and I quickly got onto the sun on the Bike &amp; Hike trail. There was an aid station at 303 &amp; Bike &amp; Hike with pizza, but I passed on it because I knew my crew had some for me at the halfway point in Silver Springs park. I caught up to a pair of runners and ran with them most of the way to Silver Springs. The sun was beating down on us and the Bike &amp; Hike was a long, straight, boring stretch of asphalt with a slight incline to make feel hard. The course runs past Silver Springs Park to the entrance and it felt like the park was miles long. I eventually made it to the halfway point and met my family. I had some pizza and a slushee and smooched my dogs who had come out to cheer me on. My wife helped to roll out my IT bands a bit and gave me a bandana filled with ice for the return trip. I spent a good amount of time at Silver Springs (around 40 minutes) and was feeling decent as I started on the second part of the race.

## Halfway home
[56 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/bLLo-erM9Io)

Back on the Bike &amp; Hike I decided to walk 0.2 miles/run 0.3 miles to kill some distance. I kept this up for 4 miles or so and then walked a mile to cool off a bit and to try to get a feel for what my walking pace was. I ran some more with the guys I was with earlier and we stuck together until we got back onto the trail. Ledges was still beautiful the second time around, but I was definitely feeling tired by the time I got to the Kendall Lake aid station. I grabbed some quick calories and left with a group of 100 milers and pacers who I stuck with through the meadows and back into the woods.

## From Dawn to Dusk
[66 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/cz-tRCd7zcI)

I went on ahead from the group when they stopped to wait for someone to catch up. I hadn’t refilled my water at Kendall Lake because I thought I had enough, and had a pretty low point on my way back due to fading light, running out of water, and my Garmin being so off that I couldn’t judge how far it was to the aid station. I’m pretty sure someone went out and stretched out the trail to make it a few miles longer on the way back. Once I got back to Pine Hollow and ate some watermelon, fried chicken, and ramen I was feeling way better. I grabbed a fresh headlamp (this was a bad idea) and headed back into the woods.

## In the Dark
[70 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/lVQIsAl8xVs)

I started the next section mostly power hiking through some quick hills. Runners were pretty spread out at this point and every time I saw a headlamp in the distance I put in a run to catch up and get past them. I have a dim memory of an aid station in here somewhere (must have been Robinson Field), but I don’t remember what all I ate except for quesadilla. I ran with a relay runner and we chatted until we got back into the Marsh of Misery. Lots of people were taking care to slowly pick their way through less-muddy patches. I started to do the same but my foot slipped into the mud and I decided to ditch that plan and run straight through the middle. I also found a water bottle in the mud and carried it with me to the next aid station. I was feeling really good coming out of the mud. I got onto the long Towpath section and it pretty quickly turned into a grind, probably because it was so dark and everyone was so spread out. It felt like it went on forever. The Valley Picnic aid station had ramen and I took off still feeling good. Here I ran into my next major problem: The headlamp I had grabbed at Pine Hollow is a few years old and the battery was dying super fast, even though it had been fully charged. It was about 1:30am at this point and I would be in really bad shape if I lost my light, so I picked it up through the woods back to Oakhill. I just barely made it to the aid station, using a (&lt;10% battery) phone as a flashlight.

## From Dusk to Dawn
[Quick 80 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/_sxyc92tgxA) and [82 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/W8mb_O_2n4c)

Oakhill aid station at night was my favorite aid station of the race. The theme was “Blues Brothers” and the aid station included a projector showing Blues Brothers on the side of a barn on repeat, volunteers in suits and fedoras, perogies, pancakes, and bacon. This was also my last drop bag, so I grabbed a bunch of food and swapped out my shirt, headlamp, and socks, and brushed my teeth. I also got my headphones out and put on some music as I ran out of the aid station. I knew the next section had a bunch of downhill, road, and then uphill, so I powered down to the covered bridge and tried to run as much as possible on the roads. An orange sliver of moon was rising over Hale Farm and I stopped a couple of times and turned off my headlamp to look at the stars. I got back into the woods and did more power hiking and a bit of running to catch some people. I had a short stop at the O’Neil Woods aid station, but I didn’t stay long because I knew Botzum was only 1.6 miles away. I had forgotten that those 1.6 miles had a ton of vert, but I made it through and rolled into Botzum still feeling good.

## Vert and Hurt
[93 Mile Check-in](https://youtu.be/Y-Lk5E8WVZ8)

At Botzum I wanted to get out pretty quickly since I was feeling good. I ate some ramen and grilled cheese and got back onto short towpath section past the [smelly bio-energy plant](https://goo.gl/maps/8CFkxVUBJyYCPqkS7). From here I entered some super hilly trail that I remembered from the previous morning. I did lots of hiking with short sprints (less than a minute). My feet and IT bands were killing me and I later found that what I thought were rocks in my shoes were actually deep blisters on the balls of my feet. My lowest point of the race was during this section because it felt like it took FOREVER. My stomach started getting upset and the sun was coming up and I just wanted to be done hiking. Eventually I made it back to North Hawkins aid station where I had some grapes, quesadilla, and chips. I put on a podcast ([Ten Junk Miles](https://www.tenjunkmiles.com/)) and hiked up the [Parkour course](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/ohio/parkour-path-and-buckeye-trail) (long uphill section with little rollers throughout), which wasn’t enjoyable but also didn’t feel as long as I thought it would.

## Lapped by the sun
The sun was up enough that I didn’t need my headlamp when I crossed the railroad tracks and got back onto the last stretch of Towpath. Two relay runners ran by and I decided to run with them. My IT bands loosened up as I ran and I started to feel much better. I ran the 2 miles to the Memorial Parkway aid station pretty hard and ate more ramen and drank some Gatorade. This was the last aid station and I knew it was less than 5 miles to the finish. I ran the road section back to the trail, except for some long uphills. A bit of walking on the trail helped to recover a bit and then I ran most of the way back to the stairs at around mile 100. It felt like those stairs would never end, but I emerged onto the last section of trail and continued running as much as I could until I hit the road. After crossing the Cuyahoga River and climbing one last long hill the finish came into sight. I sprinted past my family and across the line in 28:16:39, finally completing my first 100 miler.

### Post-race
Honestly, I felt pretty good for having run over 100 miles. I’ve felt worse after hard marathons than I did at the end of Burning River. I guess this is what it feels like when you pace yourself.

I had a beer and a breakfast burrito at HiHo Brewing Co. and my wife drove me to my mom’s house in Lakewood. The drive was about 45 minutes and on the way I almost fell asleep and then suddenly got super nauseous. At the house, I took a quick shower and immediately passed out in a recliner for about 6 hours. My wife woke me up with a Panera sandwich and mac &amp; cheese. Once I had slept and eaten a bit, I was feeling much better. We picked up the dogs and drove back to Columbus where I crushed a ton of Shake Shack and slept another 10 hours.

## Good, Bad, Ugly
### What Went Well?
* **Nutrition/hydration**: My strategy was basically 2 Endurolytes, water refill, and whatever food looked best at every aid station. I’ve heard that after 60 miles it’s an eating contest, so I took as much “real” food (fruit, ramen, PBJs) as I could in the second half of the race. If I felt waterlogged I would have more salt/food until things balanced out. My stomach was good for almost the entire race, though it was definitely getting more challenging to sustain towards the end.
* **Pacing**: I went out slow and it paid off. Besides my feet, nothing hurt worse at 90 miles than it did at 40 miles. I felt like I could have kept running for another day if I had to.
* **Shoes**: I ran in Brooks Adrenaline ASR 14s, which have trail soles and a Gore-Tex upper. Perfect mix of support and durability for the trail. I had 2 other pairs of shoes if I needed them, but nothing was killing me in the Adrenalines so I stuck with them. My only issue was the widest part of my left foot was rubbing a bit, but thinner socks and looser lacing took care of that.
* **Bandana full of ice**: My wife filled a muslin bandana with ice at the halfway point that I wore around my neck. It kept me cool on the back half of the Bike &amp; Hike and I liked having some easily-accessible ice to munch on.

### What Went... Not as Well?
* **Garmin**: This is the first time I’ve used UltraTrac on my Garmin and it measured my distance WAY off. My watch was around 20 miles over by the end of the event and added 3 miles in the first 10. On the plus side, the battery lasted for the entire 28+ hours (with 15% to spare), but it made pacing difficult later in the race.
* **Phone battery**: I got a generic battery case for my phone before the race, but early on my phone stopped charging. The cell service was terrible and made it super difficult for people to track my progress. The race uses [RaceJoy](https://www.racejoy.net/) to track participant progress in real-time and I couldn’t get it to work correctly on my phone. I’ve heard it’s better in areas with good cell coverage, but I had a rough time with it for this race.
* **Miles 90-95**: I think I forgot to take salt at the mile 87 aid station, but even if I had this would have been a rough stretch. I knew it was a long way to the next aid station with a lot of vert, and I wasn’t looking forward to it. I probably could have done more to fix the issues that came up in this section, but my brain was fried.

### What Would I Do Differently?
* **Aid stations**: I spent a lot of time in the crew-access aid stations. I was a bit paranoid that I would run through an aid station and forget something important, so when I came into a crewed aid station I would spend at least 10-20 minutes there to make sure I had plenty of time to do whatever I needed to do. In retrospect, I probably could have hustled a bit more in the aid stations, especially at the halfway point, and improved my time significantly.
* **Headlamps**: Coming so close to losing light over night was terrifying. In the future I will definitely carry a backup headlamp/flashlight.

## What’s next?
My wife and I are having our first child in September, so that’s probably going to take up most of my attention this fall and winter. In the spring I am running the [Atlanta Marathon](https://www.atlantatrackclub.org/2020-publix-atlanta-marathon-half-marathon-5k), and I would love to volunteer for Burning River or Mohican 100 next year if possible. At some point I will try another hundred. I’ve been looking at the [Badger](https://www.tenjunkmiles.com/badger-100), [Vermont](https://vermont100.com/), [Keys](https://www.keys100.com/), and [Mohican 100](http://ombc.net/mohican-100-trail-run/mohican-100-trail-run-general-info), but it will probably be a while before it’s logistically possible. In the meantime, I will focus on training as much as I can while getting ready to be a dad.

Ultramarathon,brian_stelter,Timing of food and fat adaptation,"Hey folks,

I recently learned a bit about fat adaptation and have a basic understanding of how diet and training play into making this change.

My loose understanding:

1). Training at a sufficiently low intensity allows the body to rely primarily on fat for fuel.  Doing a bunch of this, the body learns to go faster (more watts) without calling on the anaerobic system.

2).  Eating sugar, particularly around/during training, can interfere with efforts to train the fat burning aerobic system.  For this reason, some folks recommend a low carb, high fat diet (and avoid sugars except for fueling high intensity work / races).

Let me know if I have misunderstood anything!

Based on this, I understand not to stuff my face with GU gels before my steady state cardio work.  However, this leaves me with many questions about what I can do around training without inhibiting fat adaptation.

1.  Can I eat something LCHF before my training, e.g. Greek yogurt, nuts, etc?  

2.  Would I be better off training fasted?

3.  Does snacking on trail mix (or similar LCHF) undermine the training benefit/fat adaptation of long duration efforts (say hiking 20 miles, 2hr bike ride, etc)?

Thanks for any input.  I have newbie paranoia about this stuff.",1563387468

Recently [a Harvard lab was able to collect marathon runner's stool and identify a performance-enhancing microbe](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/06/performance-enhancing-bacteria-found-in-the-human-microbiome). However, the gut microbiome is an extremely complex ecosystem and thus it will be many decades before we're able to replace whole stool with synthetic versions. 

The main issue is that since the gut microbiome impacts the entire body, donors have to be in exceptional health with little to no life time antimicrobial use. [Due to a variety of modern perturbations, our host-native microbiomes have been going extinct](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bat7ml/while_antibiotic_resistance_gets_all_the/). This is a climate-change-level threat, so if you say no, you should understand what you're saying no to. 

A number of research groups have gone directly to secluded tribes, such as the [Hadza](http://www.popsci.com/article/science/scientist-gives-himself-fecal-transplant-try-hunter-gatherers-microbiome). But using them as stool donors isn't currently feasible. So we have to find people in modern society in peak physical and mental health, with unperturbed, disease resistant gut microbiomes. The microbioma.org project is trying to find the fewer than 1% of people who qualify and connect them with doctors, researchers, and people who need FMT.

Due to the difficulty of finding high quality donors, nearly all the clinical trials, doctors, stool banks, etc. are using low quality donors. Which is both dangerous and ineffective. Many patients are left to find their own donors, which is nearly impossible for most of them. Right now, microbioma.org is a completely volunteer-based organization. The only people getting paid are the stool donors. 

If any coaches would be willing to bring this up with their athletes that would be greatly appreciated! Also what time of the year would it be best to approach coaches with this? 

And if you don't qualify but know someone who might, please pass this on to them! I've been following the microbiome research daily for 4+ years so I can probably answer most of your questions!",1563192019
Ultramarathon,rektourRick,Gear check - Catoctin 50k," 

Hey guys, I'm running the [Catoctin 50k](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=59189)  this Saturday and wanted some feedback on my gear. The course itself  shouldn't be an issue, but I'm expecting the heat index to be between  98-105 on Saturday with a bunch of humidity, and I am not a strong hot  runner. I'm thinking of taking the following gear

Shirtless, short shorts, buff to dunk in streams, 2 1/2L handhelds, 8 GUs to supplement aid station food.

The  aid station are at 6,9, 15.6, 22, and 25 miles so I think a liter of  water is plenty. My very hopeful guess is the longest split between aid  stations is no more than an hour and a half.

My 2 big questions

1. Am  I making a mistake using handhelds? I'd like to avoid a vest since  it'll mean wearing an extra 2 layers of clothes. There \*should\* be some  streams to fill up at but I don't know where they're located
2. Any  recommendations for gear to store ice in? I was thinking of getting  some arm sleeves or maybe an ice bandanna. I think I'll have a good race  if I can avoid overheating, but it'll be tough in that heat.",1563161738

Ultramarathon,brian_stelter,Aerobic Base Building: am I doing this right?,"Hey folks,

I have recently started very low heart rate steady state training per the Maffetone formula, and am not sure if I’m doing it right. I don’t feel worn down by the training, so naturally, second guessing myself and would appreciate input.


In my case, 180-27-5 (or 10) = 143-148.. and just to be conservative (starting off the couch), I hug the lower end.

My daily workout is usually one of the following:

1.  4x30’ inclined treadmill @ &lt;148
2.  4x30’ exercise bike @ &lt;148
3.  10+ miles of walking outside @ easy HR, active recovery pace, chew the fat.

Because I am not doing much running due to body weight, there is no major wear and tear to recover from.  I have been doing one of these each day and feel pretty great!

However, as above, I am not sure if I’m training in a way that makes sense. My goal is to build a massive aerobic base and eventually get to running the long stuff. Right now, I’m too heavy to run too far, so my first 50k could be some time off.  

In the meantime, I want to be doing the right things and have some questions:

1. Is 4x30’ a good setup for a steady state workout, or would it be better to eliminate the breaks and try for 120’ continuously?  I would just need to bring multiple water bottles to gym to last me without several refills.

2. Is this a “good” amount of volume for aerobic base building? I am second guessing my work because it’s been pretty painless.  Expect this will change once I slim down and add/increase running miles.

3. Any comments/ideas on how my approach could be better. My schedule right now is flexible (job hunt).

Thanks!!",1562981007

Ultramarathon,WaryAdventurer,Where did I got wrong?,"I’m a little frustrated, and I’m hoping someone can offer some suggestions/alterations. I’ve been heat training all spring and summer. I live in a very dry environment and the average temperature is around 98. I am diligent with my hydration and electrolytes. I feel like I’m very heat adapted, current on heat research, etc.  I plan all my runs mid-day, and I run almost everyday. I never run under an hour so I’m in the heat quite a bit each day. I haven’t had an issue until yesterday and today. 

Yesterday I had a hill workout, and it took me about 3 hours to complete. The temp was around 100 for the duration of that time. I was really hydrated and felt great. I was trying to find the gnarliest hill I could find in my area, and it happened to be on a road. About 2ish hours in a started to feel a little woozy. Not “hot” (I never feel hot, I love the heat) but possible heat exhaustion symptoms. I figured it was because the road surface was hotter, and I was just reacting to the refracted heat from the pavement. 

Today I had a nice, short run. I almost took a small water bottle because I was going to be out just a little over an hour, but filled my hydration pack with water and ice, just to be safe. Four miles in and I collapsed! I remember getting up but not falling. I turned around and headed back (to work, all bloody..lovely) but felt more and more dizzy and nauseous. Sweat rate went down, headache set in. I was a bit out of it. I live and work in a super remote area, so I didn’t see anyone to flag down for help, and I also have a training plan to keep, so I just ran back. I was a mess when I walked in the door. Classic heat exhaustion symptoms and my heat rate took a couple hours to come back down. My pee, however was clearish, and I was super hydrated. 

I’m bummed because I really enjoy running in the afternoon, I work at a very running friendly place where I can leave work and complete my runs which doesn’t interfere with family time, and it just makes me happy.

I could not sleep last night due to hot weather. I got up around 5am and did 180 mins of (fasted) cardio at 140-150HR. My HR may have spiked a bit but I don’t think very far outside this range.

Given my conditioning level, the heat, and perhaps inadequate hydration/electrolytes during, this much work kicked my ass and hours later (plus a good nap) I am feeling it. HR is up and I am feeling super sluggish. Realize I overstretched myself (perhaps overheated too) with the third hour. Assuming I went too far, what can I be doing to 1) maximize benefits of this overkill work and 2) get back to equilibrium for a more measured workout tomorrow?

I've posted the UK one before but these are pretty big updates I've done recently.  This is a big deal for me because I love using races as excuses to travel and hike.  Being able to see ""ok, I can do this race in the desert, then this race in the PNW...""etc. helps a lot and I figured other people out there would like to be able to do it, too.

So you can see every race course (a step up from run100s start points) and you can see what races actually overlap and use the same trail/road (ie.  Cool Moon, Rio Del Lago and Western States all share some of the same miles).  Because maybe you want to get on the WS trail any way you can or maybe you want to see just how close different races actually gets to each other.

You can also have it show races by month so when you're planning your year's calendar it's a lot easier.  

There's even a couple races in here that haven't happened yet, but since they submitted to ITRA, the data is actually available.  That's kinda cool.

Hope this helps some people with their racing.  If I'm missing anything, let me know.  There's a link in each of the maps to find more info about all the races, too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Training**

This was my first ultra involving any running. I walked a 65k in the Peak District at the beginning of April and felt okay, so started building up some long runs after that, culminating in a 42k training run/walk (my first marathon) about five weeks ago. On the advice of the community here, I tried a 50k three weeks ago but was only able to manage 28k before my lower legs forced me to walk. I took a week off, ran a couple of short runs the next week and a couple of very short runs in the last week. I figured the 50k was too close to my 42k and that it was super important I rest and go in under-trained rather than start the race tired.  


**Goals**

Having taken 16 hours to walk 65k in April with about 2500m of elevation, I knew that finishing shouldn't be an issue. I knew time on feet wouldn't be a problem, so the running was the big question. The 42k I did in training hurt towards the end (and I'd tapered for two weeks for that), but I figured I'd be stronger because of it. But, still, beyond 50k was a big unknown for me and I was really excited about finding out what it would feel like.

1. Finish within the cut-off of 16 hours. Success.
2. Finish within 12 hours. Success.

&amp;#x200B;

**The race - strategy**

I take a while to warm up so went out slowly, walking the first minute, then running for four minutes. I repeated that cycle for 20 minutes before I switched to 8 minutes of running and 2 minutes of walking. I found my walking pace was almost as fast as half the field's running pace, so was slowly moving my way up the field almost from the start. I felt quite smug when I was the only person walking from the start line and there turned out to be a massive queue to get through a gate at the end of the field anyway!

&amp;#x200B;

**First 50k**

This felt good. I think there was a cock-up with the first aid station being at 16k rather than the advertised 22k. In the confusion, I (and others) ran straight through it without filling up. With the next station being 38k, that meant about 4 hours running with only the single litre of water I'd put in at the start. But I found a shop and bought 500ml of ice cold water which smoothed things a bit. The rest of the first 50k went really well for me, and I came out of it feeling a million times better than at the end of the 42k I'd ran/walked in training.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second 50k**

Despite feeling good (-ish), I did slow down considerably over the nest 50k. I maintained the 8 minutes running, 2 minutes walking until about 60k. Between 60k and 70k I was fighting cramp, and switched to 7 minutes running, 3 minutes walking. Apart from an occasion where I had cramp in both hamstrings (and fell over in front of a group of concerned-looking girl guides), my walking periods came in just before things were about to tighten up. It was about 65k that I realised I was dehydrated and  started to double up my water consumption at the following checkpoints. The cramp disappeared about 70k and never came back. All this time, I did pass the odd competitor. I couldn't see anyone in front of me, but didn't think anyone behind me was going faster. Not that I would've changed my pace anyway. Shout out to the very fast looking runner in front of me who was struggling with the navigation - we bumped into each other three times only for you to disappear again!

&amp;#x200B;

Cley beach came at 82k - I'd ran some of it in training and thought it pointless to run across the shingle. A marshal pointed out the tide was out and suggested I run along where there were occasional ribbons of sand. It was great advice, but I'd already decided I'd walk the 6k of shingle. A runner in front of me was running it, but they didn't seem to be pulling away from me much at all, so I think I made the right decision, knowing how sapping it was running on the shingle. Off the beach, on to some little hills towards Sheringham and the finish, and I felt well enough to run probably faster than I had all race. Thinking I could do a 25 minute 5k to the finish. Only to bonk with about 1k to go. I just completely felt flat, dizzy, no energy whatsoever, and had to walk, slowly. Knowing it was too late, I stuffed fudge and water down me to try and trick my mind into thinking there was some fuel coming, only to turn a corner and a marshall say ""Come on, the finish is only around the corner and you're in the top 10."" I thought she was joking, but did manage to summon up a decent running pace, see my family just before the finish and my two kids run up to me and run with me across the finish line. Amazing! 

11h 16min and seventh place. Unbelievable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts**

Despite the bonk at the end, and some water issues, I pretty much nailed my race management. Running/walking kept my legs stretched. I didn't run too fast and I didn't walk too slow. I never spent long at checkpoints. I was using Tailwind, with one stick pack (200 calories) every two hours, mixed with a litre of water. But I stopped the Tailwind at 80k, thinking I had enough in the tank to finish. I should've continued the Tailwind for another hour and I'd have been alright. More water next time, too.

&amp;#x200B;

If you got this far, thanks for your patience. You can probably tell I'm over the moon with how I did. And this is good evaluation for me. Any suggestions for future improvement? What I should try next? I think I'd prefer something shorter and harder/faster next. This looks more my style:  [https://www.letsdothis.com/e/dark-peak-30-ultra-trail-19421](https://www.letsdothis.com/e/dark-peak-30-ultra-trail-19421)

**Equipment**

Shoes:  
Inov-8 Terraultra G - performed brilliantly. I have several toenails about to come off but the shoes are roomy and I don't think they are to blame. Just my feet aren't used to the distance.

&amp;#x200B;

Pack:  
Orange mud endurance pack - comfortable pack but the front pockets only take soft flasks and I don't get on with those so I was using the bladder in the back. It's a faff and not something I would want to mess around with again. Checkpoint staff were very helpful with getting the top of though! I think I'd prefer a pack where I can carry two 500ml hard flasks instead. Any recommendations? I already have an UD 500ml bottle that I really like, so something that can contain two of those would be ideal.

Ultramarathon,Chobo_Knows,First Ultra Complete,"Goddamn!, My first Ultra is complete! I finished in 15 hours and 32 min, Elevation of 2700 M about 8,800 ft, 39th/ 236 (81 DNF)! I posted on reddit about a month before the race and got some amazing feedback about preparation and what to expect, thanks for that. Before this race the longest training run I did was about 3 hours and a lot of people responding said that was a problem! Actually in the race it wasn't at all, I felt amazing at 42k since most of the first part was hiking! 

I've been so pumped that I finished and finished strong! I def. have a runner's high right now and want to jump into another one, how long do you all recommend before I hit another one? Is a 100k doable in October?  If I do sign up for another rae in October how much time should I spend for recovery, today I just had my first run 5 miles, it's been about 5 days since the Ultra!

Ultramarathon,bondom3417,Post Race Recovery Time/Activity,"Hi all, completed my first race 6/1 (a little over 50 miles) and was looking for a timeframe most people use to return to somewhat normal running.  I sprained my ankle and was still on it for a week after the race doing slower recovery stuff (I know dumb, it was a mix of I didn't realize what it was and I was sore in general a bit so didn't realize the extent) and took last week almost entirely off.  This week I've been hoping to maybe do something once the ankle gets better (it is getting there) but didn't know what sort of timeline to go from as I've read different things.

1) Assuming an individual is using proper running form and training, does the stress of ultra marathons increase your risk for permanent joint/muscle damage? I love distance running and am stoked to join the ultra community, but I'm afraid of ruining my joints.

Ultramarathon,Booerz,How to plan my training for a 50k trail race (exactly 1 year from now),"Hi ultrarunners!

I want to run a 50k trail race in June 2020; 1000m elevation and 36k on single track forrest trails. 

I have completed 4 trail half marathons in the past. Since giving birth a year and a half ago I have worked up to 30k weekly km. My plan is to train for a half marathon in October and then a practice marathon distance some time in the spring, do you think this is a realistic goal?

Ultramarathon,Hero_without_Powers,Can one 100k totally wear out a shoe?,"Shoes usually last für around 1000 km for me, maybe a bit more, since I tend to be lightweight. Recently, I did a 100k in comparably new shoes (I just did \~ 200k in them at that point) but ever since then they feel worn out. They are not nearly at the distance at which I usually switch shoes. I always have two pairs of shoes and wear them in turn so the soles have some 'time off'.

The 100k is slightly more than what I would run on average in these shoes during one week. Therefore, I thought, these shoes would just last one week less but somehow they already feel worn through.

So my question basically is this: Could it be the case that the 100k damaged the sole so much that it is just worn out?",1560349168

Has anyone done any 160km ultras with no real elevation gain, which they took pretty easy? If so, how did the legs and mind feel after, and how did they feel the next day?

**RACE REPORT**

Finally a decent result under my belt after some tough races and coming up short over the past few months.

After a day of suffering at the Lake Sonoma 50m, the body recovered quickly and I started to get back to training to see if I could work some speed into my legs for my upcoming road 50k. With a month and a half between races, it was a tall order and a tight timeline to try and transition from trail runs with a good amount of elevation gain to fast and flat road!

Right as I was starting to feel good and build the miles back up again, a nasty cold hit me hard. I felt the effects for over a week and it forced me to cut back on the intensity of my workouts during that time period. I just wasn’t able to get the quality I was looking for. Eventually I kicked it though and got back into the groove. Two weeks of decent training went by as I found my legs; I managed to put in a strong effort. I was looking for one final week of build before tapering, when out of nowhere, an injury decided to show up and sideline me. On the longest run of my mini-block the Sunday 3 weeks out from the race, I noticed some pain starting to develop under the first metatarsophalangeal joint on my left foot. I didn’t think much of it during the run; it subsided after I finished and I went about with my day.

The day after though I went for a typical Monday afternoon recovery run. As I was running, I heard a loud noise up ahead just across the road from me. I kept on cruising, not paying much attention, then another bang. I look over and someone was lying at the side of the road not moving. Oh damn, those were gunshots. In downtown Calgary during rush hour commuter traffic? What the hell? People started running. I did a quick 180 and sprinted out of there. Ouch, my foot though. I felt it here. The pain came back and even worse than before. I made it 5km and the pain kept building. I had to limp back home. Yikes, not good.

I went into recovery mode. Physiotherapy, alternating heat/cold on the foot, rolling, topical creams, and a week completely off running followed by another week of gradually increasing mileage is what it took to get my foot feeling ok again (and there were still some random twinges happening in the foot too). Not exactly great coming into a race! I wasn’t feeling confident anymore. I felt like I was struggling more on my runs and that my usual flow wasn’t there. Part of it was definitely mental; I knew I still had the fitness, but taking that break really knocked me down a peg. Regardless, I had a week left to turn things around. I focused on consistent running and hoping that I would at least get the chance to toe the line. Fortunately, in the last several days before the race, the pain in my foot disappeared completely, and I figured I could give the race a shot.

Originally, I was aiming big. I wanted to run a 3:05 which I felt would be right around the time required to take first place. However, with the quality of training being subpar, I wanted to at least finish (still with a half decent time hopefully). I also wanted redemption from last year, where I hit the wall hard and spent some time puking at the 38km mark (and subsequently DNFing). The game plan was to run the 30km conservatively and then pick the pace up after rounding the turnaround point at Bowness, leaving me 20km to chase down the leaders if I had more left in the tank.

Race morning, up and at it. 4:45 AM. Fueled, geared up, and out the door. Nice and cool out. Maybe 5°C, sun just rising. Beautiful! I walked down from my place to the bus and hopped on to get to the start line at the Stampede Park. On arrival I headed into the grandstand. The elites had a section inside for pre-race preparation, which I definitely took full advantage of (I’m not used to that, typically with trail ultras it’s super low key). Stretch, warmup, some chatting with the other elites. Then it was time. We were escorted to the corral. I downed two gels, took my position, and waited for the countdown.

Boom, we were off. I knew Jacob Puzey would go out fast, and away he went. I wasn’t going to get roped into trying to stick with him off the start this year! I held my pace \~3:45 min/km. We ran north out of Stampede Park, east through East Village, then north past the zoo and to the first turnaround at the TELUS Spark around 5km in. There were a few hills, but everything was feeling ok. I was in second place and Jacob wasn’t too far in front. No problem.

Back I went, through Bridgeland, onto Memorial Drive, and then back downtown to run west on 11th Ave. 8km in, time to fuel. The gel went down easy. Awesome. I passed by my buddies at the Mito aid station, grabbed some water, and kept going. Still feeling good. I saw Dave Proctor and the Outrun Rare crew in East Village and waved as I went past (I thought it was wild that he was up and at it so early in the morning cheering people on after breaking the 12h and 100 mile treadmill world records the day before at the Calgary Expo… crazy)! Ok, running west on 11th Avenue. Oof, headwind! Yikes. I was hoping it would just be for that small stretch through the skyscrapers, maybe with the wind being forced through at street level. I pushed through, and made it to the Kensington turn to get onto Memorial. 15km in here. Things were feeling a bit worse than expected. My pace was a few seconds slower than what I was looking for at this point, \~3:49 min/km. All good though, keep pushing.

Jumping onto Memorial, ah damn. The headwind was back, and it was strong. That open and lonely stretch of road, running west, it drained me! From this point, it was around 15km of west/northwest running all the way to Bowness Park before I hit the turnaround at 30km. I slowed down. I tried to justify it due to the headwind, telling myself to stick with the plan of turning up the pace as soon as I hit that turnaround. The wind would be at my back, right? It should be easy from that point onwards! So I pressed on. 16km, gel number 2. No problems there. A few of my BVH teammates out for their Sunday run found me and cheered me on. I kept on grinding, all the way to the marathon turnaround and then past it, where we ducked onto some paved pathways. I took in my 3rd gel around the 25km mark. Hmm, my stomach was feeling heavier than usual. No matter, and I brushed it off. This section of the course featured some twists and turns, and at one point I just about missed a sharp right hand turn onto a pedestrian bridge. Thankfully there was a bit of a chalk arrow to guide me. Phew! It was tough to fall into a rhythm though. Somewhere on these paths, my buddy Chris passed me. He was looking strong, much stronger than myself. He dropped me immediately (after some encouragement was shared between us both).

I crossed the final bridge and knew the 30km turnaround was up ahead. Chris was still in my sights, less than a minute in front of me. And there was Jacob, on his way back in. I thought he might be 3 minutes ahead at most. Buuut I was still feeling worse than I should have at this point. I told myself, this is the point where I need to pick it up. Let’s get these legs moving. The body didn’t cooperate though. I hit the turnaround and tried to get things going, but it just wasn’t happening. Ok, time to fall back to just a pure grind. No giving up. Flashbacks of me on my hands and knees puking my guts out last year ran through my head. That wasn’t going to happen this year, no way. I urged myself forward, back through the pathways and onto the marathon course.

I was still taking in a bit of water at most aid stations, and at some point along this stretch downed my 4th gel. I had packed 5 in my shorts, but for some reason I was missing one. It must have fallen out at some point? I didn’t even notice. Even if I had it, I figured I wasn’t going to be able to take it. My stomach felt bloated and really heavy. Was it possible that I was taking in too much? Typically I’m the other way around, not consuming enough calories in the race, so this was a different feeling for me.

I continued slowing down but kept forcing my legs to keep going. I was on the marathon course now, and large groups of people were out running the marathon, now on their way back in themselves. I had to weave through the traffic for the next 5km until getting back onto Bowness Road and then Memorial where things opened up again. The 40km mark went by, and I knew I should be able to grind this out regardless of how long it took. It was just going to be 10km of suffering though. Time to dig deep and embrace my time in the pain cave.

At this point I was wondering where the promised tailwind was. Where did it go!? For the amount of headwind on the way out, I thought I might feel it coming back in. Unfortunately, I didn’t. I wasn’t able to use any of that momentum to carry me through the final grind in (or maybe it was still there and I was hurting too much to notice it). To make matters worse, my foot pain started flaring up again. Oh no, not good at all. It reminded me of when it first started hurting in training. Slow, gradual, building pain. Ugh. I pushed on as it wasn’t too bad, but it still was a constant reminder, compounding on all the other hurt that I was feeling.

Some of the BVH crew found me again, and kept me going. I was counting down the kilometers now. I hit one of the aid stations around 46km in and took a sip of water. Ooo that didn’t sit right. Immediate gag reflex, and a bit of my vomit found its way into my mouth. Don’t puke, don’t puke. I willed it back down and was left with that awful burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Oddly enough, I wasn’t feeling my foot pain anymore. That’s a win, right?

Back under the Center Street bridge, ok we’re nearly there. I passed by Dave and the Outrun Rare crew again, and they fueled my final push to the finish. I wasn’t speeding up by any means though. My pace had suffered greatly. 3:55 min/km, 4:00 min/km, 4:10… 4:20. But I was going to make it.

Back down into Stampede Park, onto the race track, and through the arches. A hard fought 3:17:39 and 3rd place overall. I was done.

I shared a beer with friends in the grandstands, took my place on the podium (prizing consisted of a cowboy hat and a 6 pack of beer, woohoo!), and then made the journey home for some rest, happy I was able to redeem myself this year at the Canadian 50k championships.

**THE DAMAGE**

* My left foot pain flared up again in the race. I went to the podiatrist, went through my history as an ultrarunner, and he looked at both of my feet. He noted that the left was swollen in the area I was experiencing the pain. He then ordered that I stop running until further investigation was done. He issued me referrals for X-rays and an ultrasound. Once complete, he would run through the results with me and go from there. So I’m grounded for now. Right as the summer racing season is about to begin, 1 month out from the Sinister 7 100 mile Canadian championships, and 3 months out from CCC. Ugh. The mountains were nearly snow free too. I hate waiting, but that’s what I have to do. No sense making anything worse. It doesn’t mean I have to like it though! I should find out later next week the fate of the rest of my 2019 racing season. Keeping my fingers crossed until then.

**THE POSITIVES**

* I finished, grabbed a spot on the podium, and would say I can check this race off of my list of ones I wanted redemption at. Hooray!
* 50k personal best, not too bad.
* I know with a proper training block, I can run it even faster. I can do way better, and that’s exciting.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

* Nutrition/Hydration:
   * Did I eat too much? I should see if I can lock this down a bit better. It’s a constant battle for me. Eating too little, now possibly eating too much? Hmm.
* Training:
   * When I get back up and running (hopefully sooner rather than later), I need to find a coach that will help me build smarter than I have been myself. I’ve been putting this off for too long. Time to do my research and find someone that aligns with what I’m looking to achieve.

Well, I got through it, but at what cost? I thought I was healed, and my foot felt fine going in, but now I’m sidelined for an indeterminate amount of time. I’m in full recovery mode once again. Hopefully I’m able to get back on my feet soon. I love running too much to stay away; it’s going to kill me if this recovery is longer than I expect.

Ultramarathon,daydreamurr,Who is in the wrong here? Race Director vs Misled runner,"Hello friends and fellow ultra athletes of reddit. This past weekend I participated in my 3rd official ultramarathon and ran into a major hiccup out on the course. Out of the little respect I still hold for the race via the awesome volunteers and effort to organize the race it shall go nameless. 
So here’s the story. In the weeks leading up to Saturday’s event I studied and memorized the set course as provided by the RD on ultrasignup and used a map linked from the races official race timing website since the races actual website had no course map. The one provided on their site was simply one of the state parks maps. This course is an out and back riddled with a couple loops. 15.79 miles out and 15.79 back. Simple enough right? However as someone who has gotten lost during a race before I went out of my way to ensure to the best of my abilities that it didn’t happen again. 
My race starts and I’m positioned firmly in the top 10 as I reach the 25k turnaround point. This is where I will admit I am at fault. Runners were coming towards me and even stopped to ask me if we were supposed to go back down a trail that was in the course description. A few agreed that we were and as I approached it saw no barricade suggesting it wasn’t part of this years course nor did I see race ribbons (as I descended down this trail however I did come across a young hiker with several of them in his hand so I figured he may have been taking them from the course). As I approached a crossroad littered with race volunteers I was directed to run straight and not back up a stretch of single track to complete a loop even after confirming with him that I was running the 50k. As I ran down the trail I could feel something was wrong and one of the runners who had been discussing whether or not to take the trail before the turn around asked if we were going the right way. I replied that it didn’t look like it. Demoralized and frustrated I decided to drop to the 25k and head back to the finish after discussing the mix up with an aid station volunteer and race official they confirmed that we were in fact off course. I even showed them the map and questioned why I wasn’t directed up the single track or told to go back up the trail and back on course. I also discovered as I hiked to them that we were racing trails that were left off the course description and maps all together. They suggested I talk to the RD who again will go nameless out of respect. I crossed the finish line after hiking back and informed the RD that I had chosen to drop the 25k and that the course had several descrepencies between what was directed via course description and what it was on race day and that I would appreciate a partial refund. She refused and insisted that no where on her race websites did it say to take that trail.  I conceded not having service to pull up my evidence on site besides the course map I had saved to my phone. The rest of my weekend consisted of swallowed frustration and of course a disappointing GOTs episode. I decided to email the RD with all the evidence, a detailed account of what happened, and a respectful request that we work out some sort of solution. No response. 
I understand that I am at fault. I understand that these events take a lot to put on. But what I find unacceptable is the lack of consistency with what this RD has out on her websites listed as official and her refusal to even attempt to understand why her competitors are getting lost. I more than likely won’t be recieving a response from her and that’s fine I just will not return to any of her events. I would just like to know if I’m in the wrong alone in this as I’ve been made out to be by this person or not. It is a shame cause it it was a perfect day out there and the course, for the most part, was beautiful. I’m still a little bummed about how this turned out for me but am happy for those who had a more positive race experience.",1557866140

Ultramarathon,Nwilson90,Ultras as the goal,"I searched and couldn’t find my answers so sorry if this has been answered. I’ve recently started running(like first 5k ran straight in April) and I know ultras are a long ways off but they are the goal because even in my fittest, 3 sports HS athlete days I wasn’t above average fast so I want to go for distance.  Realistically for a 29-yo ex-athlete( a decade of very little), how long of running X miles a week before I should consider training for something like a 50k. I’m currently at about 15 miles a week with my longest runs being 4 miles. On an unrelated note but hopefully someone here has experience, as a heavy runner(~250lbs) how much faster will my shoes need replaced compared to the standard 3-400 miles?

Ultramarathon,runner_1005,Hundred miler shoes,"I've got a hundred miler coming up and I'm hunting for some new shoes. I've done most of my recent trail ultras in La Sportiva Mutants, and when they're good they're great - but I'm having occasional rubbing issues with them, and I'm not overly impressed by how quickly the tread wore down. So I'm looking to draw up a short list to try on, and hopefully get some training miles into. 

My next race is likely to have a good chunk of rocky, wet, fell type running involved - with long periods of more usual UK trails in between. So grip on wet rock is important which rules out Hoka Challenger type shoes.
Drop wise, 6-10mm should be fine. I should consider Altras but feel like zero drop is not a variable I want in training right now. 

I'm considering Inov8 Roclite 305, La Sportiva Bushido 2, and maybe some Hoka Speedgoat 2's. Scott have caught my eye but I know little about them. Whilst I get on with SC4's, all the other Salomons I've tried have been too narrow fit.

Any others that should be on my short list - or any on there that shouldn't be?",1557695886

Ultramarathon,neftyoil,Wanting to get into ultras but relatively new to running. Looking for advice,"TLDR I suppose: I am 26, I know everyone is different and I won’t get to the point I could’ve had I been running since teenager. But at about what age range do you stop seeing significant gains in PRs? Also, I want to run trail ultras. Would it be best to gradually build up to longer stuff after being happy with shorter distances? Or should I just jump straight in? What would be best for my long term growth as a runner and for ultra running? 

just for reference: just started to train running as my main thing about 6 months ago (previously it’s been sports that do include running/endurance as a significant part of the sport, with about 30-40 miles/week of running). If you compare me to athletes from those two sports, my fitness was one of my best attributes relative to people I was competing against (1715-20 for 5K during those times)

My current goal: within about two years I want to run sub 16, see if I have that in me with correct training and a bit of weight loss (I am heavier compared to most runners my height (even comparing me to athletes of those other sports who’re my height I am a bit heavier).

I I guess age isn’t too much of a factor, but for long term development (5-10 years), would you recommend me developing my ability at shorter distances before moving up to ultras, or recommend just to jump straight in?",1557627728

Ultramarathon,Againthehuntbegins,I am now an ultra marathoner - 50k Armstrong Redwoods - finished!,"First off, thank you to this sub - I’ve probably read every post on here twice and I can’t believe how supportive and encouraging this community is.  Now I actually belong, having finished my first ultra yesterday.  I’m an ultra marathoner!  🤣.  Albeit a very slow one.

I had no idea how hard this 50k was.  There was 8,000 ft of elevation - most of it packed into 3 climbs that were 2,000 ft over 3 miles.  Note to self - try to train on similar terrain next time!  And - pick an easier one next time!  And - figure out my salt next time!!

I started off slowly and felt like I was doing a good job pacing myself and not getting too excited.  It was a beautiful course and lots of beautiful vistas with fog rolling in over the morning.  I finished the first of 3 loops without much pain and felt strong going into the second loop.  I was at about a 15 min pace and still thought I may finish under 8 hours.  I was drinking a ton of water, ate lots of pb&amp;j, chips and candy.  I was also drinking a lot of coke which may have been my downfall.  

Then the second loop - I was still in a good headspace and felt strong.  But around halfway through the second loop I started to get weird cramps under my ribs.  My knees and calves and feet hurt a lot but I figured this was normal.  But I also noticed that my sweat was insanely salty and it burned my eyes.  I was washing it out with my water.  I was still drinking a lot but I wasn’t drinking a ton of the electrolyte drink they offered as it didn’t taste good.  I was averaging at least 30 ounces of water an hour - also wasn’t peeing much.

Then towards the end of the second loop I was really starting to suffer and a woman ran by screaming ‘the cutoff is at 3:10!  I had forgotten about the cutoff to go back out for the final loop!!  So I dug deep and started hauling ass for the start/finish line.  I had 3 miles to go and I sprinted(which was like 10 minute miles - a sprint for me at that point 😂😂).  I made the cutoff by 1 minute!!!  It was the best feeling.  And the race director said - ‘you’ve got one minute - get back out there!!’.  So I did.

At this point I knew it was a 9 hour cutoff to finish and the last loop was smaller so I just needed 18 min miles to finish under the 9 hour mark.  It was just me and another runner and the sweeper - this amazing guy who runs the Healdsburg Running Team.  Nicest guy in the world and I felt like I had my own private motivational coach/guru to help me finish.  

But by the time we got to the aid station at the top and I only had 3 miles of downhill to go and had 40 minutes to finish under 9 hours, I had almost completely shut down.  I couldn’t catch a full breath and it felt like I had spasms under both ribs in my back.  I could barely walk.  The woman bolted down and finished under 9!

I thought about trying to do it but I could barely walk.  So I resigned myself to just finishing.  The race director said anyone over 9 hours would get an unofficial finish and a medal.  So at least I would get that.  It was pretty emotional but at one point I just decided to enjoy the leisurely walk in the beautiful woods.  

I finished at 9:20 and there was just a handful of people breaking down the finish line but to me it was the most beautiful moment.  I talked to the super kind EMT for awhile about my ribs and I also got a world class massage from a therapist there.  

Sorry for the long post - I could write pages and pages about my first ultra.  I’m still coming down emotionally as I sit in my hotel room and try to process what the hell I just did yesterday!

I met so many nice people and I really felt like I chose the best race to break my ultra cherry.  Even though it was brutal, I embraced the suck and pushed through to the finish.  

A special shout out to Dennis who is 60 years old and
helped me immensely during and after the race.  He finished in under 9 and I felt a great connection with him - as well as everyone else there!

Thank you to this community for your kindness and motivation and information!

Next up is a 12 hour timed race in 2 months where I’m hoping to do 50 miles - but who knows?  Maybe I’ll only make it 32.5 miles!  🤣🤣

Ultramarathon,myrtleeeb,You have the power over your mind,"When you reached that point when you're so tired and your body hurts everywhere, how do you push and motivate yourself to finish the race?   


When I was running my first ultra, I reached the point where I was already accepting that I'm never gonna get that medal. Can hardly move my legs anymore, I was dehydrated, the heat was almost unbearable, and I just really wanted to give up.   
Then at the last aid station when I was about to raise the white flag, another runner told me, ""at the point **when you think you cannot go any farther,** and you truly believe that you can't go on -- **you've used about 20% of your body** and what your body is actually capable of and **it's just your brain stopping you**"".  
 

And wow. That fueled me. Before I know it, I was at the homestretch. All the pain, cramps, crazy thoughts, shortness of breath disappeared. I just realized that I've done it. The feeling of euphoria rushes through my body and I'm just as excited to do it all over again.   
I was reminded of a line in Alex Hutchinson's book, ""Endure"", that ""achievement is not possible without discomfort"".

Ultramarathon,ketomagyar,Running a marathon and a 52 miler 1 month apart - how to recover/train/taper?,"I just ran my first marathon on Saturday in 3:51. I loved it, but my ultimate goal is a 50 miler and then a 100 miler. The marathon felt great, I was well prepared and didn't start out too fast or hit the wall. I kept hydrated and fed and everything came together nicely, despite the heat. I'm grateful to never deal with injuries, and I think a lot of that is to thank with training at a low heart rate and high cadence. 

It just so happens that there's a 52 miler in my area in 4 weeks. It's Possum's Revenge, and has some elevation but nothing too crazy. I know it's not recommended to run two races like this so close together, but I'm a young guy and feel confident it will go well IF, my recovery goes well. There are plenty of registration spots open, so the plan is to train like I'm going to run, but only register and run at the last minute if my body feels ready to go. I want to roll my marathon training right into this 52 miler.

Assuming I do end up running, how do I balance the next 4 weeks of recovery/training/tapering? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",1556553345

My game is coming along great so far mecahnics-wise. As far as theme goes I’m leaning heavy on the Barkley ultra for inspiration, but for gameplay purposes I’m doing 5 days at 20 miles a day.

The mechanic for packing weight is divided into 3 sections : 1,2 and 4 weight.

**RACE REPORT**

Oh damn. Not again. California is hot, didn’t you know? 

After a day in the pain cave at the Black Canyon 100k followed by a short recovery, I got right back at the training. I hit it hard. With 7 weeks in between ultras, I had 1 week of recovery/light running, followed by 4 huge weeks, before bringing it back down with a 2 week taper. I crammed some great training in a short amount of time to better prepare myself both physically and mentally for the race ahead. By the numbers over those 4 weeks: 665km, 8669m elevation gain, and 100+ hours of total training time. I hit some solid interval sets, I had some big trail days, and even put down a 10k PB at a local road race (just for fun!), along with the usual strength training, stretching, and foam rolling to round it all out. I was tired, but happy going into the taper. I was confident that my fitness was there, and that I just needed to get out and perform on race day. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy though. Even more stacked than the Black Canyon 100k, the Lake Sonoma 50 miler featured a huge list of strong runners from the US, and even a couple of big names coming from across the ocean.

My original game plan going in was something different than my last several ultras. I wanted to take the first half a bit lighter and save some strength for the second half, and then reel in some other runners all the way into the finish. It’s been a successful strategy for some big names, and I wanted to see if I could apply a similar method to my race. However, with the forecast on race day expected to be the hottest day in the area so far all year (&gt;25°C), I made a last minute call to go out a bit quicker than originally planned to capitalize on the cool morning. I still wanted to keep some in the tank for the return trip though. 

The taper felt fine. I caught a cold a week and a half before the race but managed to kick it with plenty of time left before race day. The body felt rested and ready. Pre-race also seemed typical. There were nerves of course, but nothing unusual about that. Par for the course at this point! I think I’ve learned by now that I’ll always have those nerves, and that I should just embrace it. I flew down to San Francisco the morning before to give myself enough time to go through the motions of my pre-race travel routine. It was relatively stress-free on the way down from Canada. I went 3 for 3 with being pulled aside at security regarding my gels though! Overall things went smooth and I had an uneventful time with the flight down and rental car pick up. As I headed out of the city I went up and over the Golden Gate Bridge and navigated my way to Healdsburg for package pickup. I ran into Jared Hazen behind me at the check-in. Neat. I figured he was going to crush it, especially after his day at Black Canyon. After grabbing some free swag I was off to the hotel in Cloverdale for some afternoon rest and gear prep. I wrapped up the day with a great pre-race meal that was being hosted at Spoonbar and put on by the race organizers. They did it right! Probably the best pre-race meal I’ve had to date. Unlimited pasta, pizza, and salad. Perfect! After I had my fill I retired early to see if I could get some solid sleep before the inevitable early wake up call. 

Race day. 4:30AM. Up and at it to fuel, get the gear on, and get to the start line. It was cool out, just how I like it. I knew it wouldn’t last though! Managed to get some sweet parking right at the finish line. Perfect. Not too long after the parking lot filled and people were parking along the road. Yikes! I went through my warmup and then it was game time. 

The start line. Things were crowded. A lot of people were hanging towards the front. I didn’t worry though, the first 200 metres weren’t going to make or break a 50 mile race. 7:00AM, we were off and along the paved road to help spread the runners out before diving into the single track. Smart idea to have the course set up like this. I got caught up in the crowd for the first small section, but by the first turn I was able to get into my rhythm and get going. 

As predicted, there was a really fast group that went out hard. Hazen and the boys were going for it! I held back, determined to run my own pace. I still was going at a solid clip (~4:15 min/km average for the first 4k on the road). I was keeping an eye on the lead pack as we made our way along the road section, running with a couple of others who seemed to be doing the same thing. A drone buzzed overhead. I thought that was cool and that the footage would be great seeing everyone throwing down at the beginning. Around 4 kilometers in, we ducked into the single track. Excellent, the trails. Beautiful rolling, wonderful trails. It was absolutely gorgeous in there. I was taking it all in as we made our way towards Warm Springs Creek aid station. The track took us down towards Lake Sonoma, tucked away and shaded from the sun. Things were still nice and cool, and the trail was interesting. It was rolling, mostly dry, with a few sections of mud and a couple of small river crossings. I knew my feet were going to get wet, no way around it! I held a good pace, but made sure I was sticking with my target and not letting things get out of hand. I found a couple of other runners (Damon Valenzona, Drew Macomber) and stuck with them as they were holding the pace I was looking for as well. We cruised along, up and down. I was feeling good. I noticed though that my downhill running wasn’t as fluid and fast as it could be though. I made a mental note and continued on, not worried about taking a few extra seconds and ensuring my footing was proper so I didn’t have to take an early exit from the race.

Just before Warm Springs Creek aid, the biggest river crossing. Nice and refreshing! Got the boots soaked and carried on. Squish squish! Into the aid station, quick top up of the fluids, and I was back out on course. I was sitting in 15th position at this point, with everyone in front of me within 6 minutes. 

I made my way towards Wulfow aid. Another river crossing, some more ups and downs. Relentless. I was beginning to understand the race slogan! I noticed that the north side of the lake was very exposed. Things were still cool enough, and I kept it going at a strong (but not full out) pace. I turn a corner and boom, I’ve caught up to Senseman. That was exciting to see. I was still feeling good, so seeing him gave me a boost of confidence to keep it up. I passed him and pushed on. He was right behind me though, keeping on my heels. My fluids were still full enough at Wulfow, and I knew Madrone aid wasn’t too far off so I went right through. I was downing my gels as I ran and taking in hydration, and thought I was keeping on top of it. In between Wulfow and Madrone, Senseman passed me again. No problem. I knew he was right up ahead, so I held my course. 

Madrone aid station, ~30km into the race. Ooo things were starting to heat up. I was holding 12th position, and right behind Senseman and King. I topped up the handheld and continued to push. I knew the three biggest climbs were ahead of me. I was onto a combination of dirt road and single track, still with no shade or cover from the sun. There were a couple of really muddy patches too that had been torn up by horses. I had to watch my footing running through though! I got a bit muddy of course. The first climb didn’t seem too bad. The second climb seemed ok too. Tough but manageable. I kept the legs moving. I was able to take them without walking the majority (only one very short section I turned it into a power hike). At one point I saw both Senseman and King just ahead of me. Nice! I made it to the top in one piece, and worked on getting over to the No Name Flat aid station. In the second uphill section I saw Hazen, Spehler, Evans, and Kersh all flying downhill, pretty close together. They were still killing it, and looking strong too. Wow. Unreal!  

No Name Flat aid station, I was half way. But I was feeling it here. Man, the energy was just draining quickly. I figured it was the heat. It finally arrived. I had my sun hat on, my sun sleeves too. The stomach seemed ok, so I put down what I could at the aid. I also received some scoops of ice in the sleeves. The arms went a bit numb from the cold, but it was so nice and relieving. I doused myself in water. But that was it. I had to keep moving. In and out, I kept things quick there still. I was in 14th position, at a time of 3:17:39. I was just under 8 minutes slower than where I was hoping to be at this point, and 25 minutes back from the leaders. 

It was from here on that I started to slide into another day of hurt. I fell behind on nutrition and hydration. My stomach just wasn’t having any of it. I was nauseous. I was hot. My body seemed like it was in pain from the constant jarring on the downhills. Ouch. I kept moving back through Madrone and got sponged down with some cool water. A shock to the system, but again, nice and relieving. I continued to fall apart on my way back through Wulfow and onto Warm Springs Creek aids. I kept repeating to myself, it’s ok, it’s ok, just a temporary low point, keep going, over and over. People headed the other direction probably thought I was crazy. Unfortunately, it wasn’t temporary. I never did hit that next high that I was so desperately needing. I wanted to start ramping things up in the second half, or at least keep it consistent with the first half. I just couldn’t pull myself back together though. 

By Warm Springs Creek on the return, I had slid to 22nd position. People kept on passing me, and there was no fight left in my body. I couldn’t get any momentum back. I spent some time to try and fuel, as I knew this last section was going to be a nightmare. It was. The majority of the last 20km I was walking or slowly shuffling. I tried to keep cool in the rivers, but at this point it was just survival. I knew I could finish, but it was going to take some suffering. I didn’t quit, but it was a really demoralizing push to the finish line. 

I managed to make it through and finish, but my time was nowhere near what I was looking for at that race. I was hoping to make my mark finally in the US, but it just didn’t happen for me. Disappointing, but I have to take it in stride. Back to the drawing board. All I can do is take the lessons learned, look forward to my next race, and try to turn things around there. 

**THE DAMAGE**

* I lost my right big toenail. I ripped it off a few days after the event. It feels good now. 
* A few blisters. Not as bad as Black Canyon though. I think it was inevitable with the 12 river crossings.
* Usual post-ultra soreness! Nothing out of line though. 

**THE POSITIVES**

* I finished. Better than a DNF.  
* Between Black Canyon and Lake Sonoma, I’ve kicked off both my large toenails. Excellent, I won’t have to worry about them for awhile!
* My feet held up much better this race, even with the river crossings. The Speedgoat 3s felt great; way better than the Challengers did for me at Black Canyon. I think I had the proper shoe choice here! I stuck with my Injinji toe socks. They’re great. I also used Squirrel’s Nut Butter and lubed the feet up. Seemed to help! 
* It was another learning experience. Hooray for learning! Adding them to the list of things I need to apply at my future races. 
* My body recovered really quickly. I think this was due to my limiting factor being the heat. It caused me to slow down (which sucks), but may have saved the body a little. 

**LESSONS LEARNED**

Heat Management

 * I didn’t fare well in the heat. It was rough. The morning felt great, but as soon as things started cooking, I crashed and burned. I need to either stay away from hot races early in the season, or figure out a way to heat train in the Canadian winter (it will have to consist of indoor running which is tough at my current residence). 

Downhill Running

 * I didn’t feel strong on the downhill sections. The body was sore and aching by the second half of the race. With the whole thing being either uphill or downhill, I need to better prepare the body for the downhill running. I found it tough to train downhills in the winter. The snow cushions the body running downhill on the trails. Also I tend to dial back the speed of the downhill running too due to not wanting to injure myself in the unstable and slippery conditions. Regardless, I need to figure out how to trail the downhills even through winter, or pick flatter races in those months of the year.  

Nutrition/Hydration

 * I still need to work on this. The heat played a large factor in my intake of calories and fluids. I need to lock this down better in the future. 

**CONCLUSION**

Another day, another race under the belt at least. There’s some more things to work on. That’s ok though. It sucks putting in huge amounts of effort in training and not having it pay off on race day, but that’s the way it goes sometimes. Time to focus on my next race, the Canadian 50k road championships. I’m back on the road for a bit, time to get some speed into these legs!",1556496027

Ultramarathon,tbnrg,Beginner struggling with digestive shut down,"I ran my first 50k recently. It was some brutal terrain and elevation but I finished just under a disappointing 8 hours.

I slammed into a wall about 2/3 of the way through the race due to not consuming enough (probably 400 calories worth of gels, electrolyte powder in my water, and potato chips). I got to an aid station just putting one foot in front of the other and stretching out quad cramps, grabbed a big stack (probably 400 calories) of peanut m&amp;ms, a couple gels, and more electrolyte powder, and started walking. I knew I wouldn't finish unless I got these down... I pop one in my mouth and it turns to dust. I gag and use my powder/water mixture to wash it down. Eventually I force them all down, get a second wind, get my gels down, and start moving again.

I get to the final aid station about 5k and one BIG climb from the finish. Same plan, grab a stack of peanut m&amp;ms and start walking. This time I literally couldn't force them down without vomiting. So now I'm running on empty dragging my feet through the final few miles, watching people zip past me as I keep stopping to stretch out my seizing quads.

I do eventually finish. I buy a Gatorade, but I can't even drink it except for a couple baby sips. It's another 3.5 hours until I can actually take adult-sized sips and eat a sandwich.

I had a similar problem with a marathon I did last fall. I was cruising along at a 3:40 pace, then hit a wall about 3 miles from the end. The only thing I had been able to consume is about 300 calories of tailwind and a few small cups of Gatorade from the volunteers. I ended up finishing just under 4 hours.

How do people get their calories and electrolytes in when they're literally gagging and burping in response to the tiniest bits of food? I muscles FEEL strong enough to do better than I've been doing. I just can't seem to get my intake under control. Any advice you guys have would be awesome.",1556225968
Ultramarathon,mattkingofmen,100 miler - Avoiding the Death March,"I have completed 2 flat 100 mile races in the 21-24 hour range, but both times I had the same problem. Right around mile 87 or 88, I start to feel really sluggish. I still have motivation to run, but my body physically won’t let me. Every time I try to run some more, I can’t catch a breath and it’s an incredible effort just to slog at ~15 minute pace; I can only keep it up for about a minute. So both of my finishes have been 10+ mile death marches at 20 minute pace or slower. I’m trying to figure out how to break through this barrier. These are some thoughts I had:
* Not enough run training – my peak week was about 70 miles, including a 30 mile long run; I’m wondering if jumping up to 80 or 90 for a week will help.

* Do more strength training – only did some light deadlifts and a little core (ab wheel and plank); wondering if heavy squats/deadlifts will help

* Do more flexibility work – haven’t really done much stretching other than 5 minutes or so after some runs

* Go out more slowly – I feel like I went out at a slow enough pace; felt great all the way through 70ish miles. I’m not sure if going any slower would help, although I’m betting more frequent walk breaks would help a little bit.

* Caffeine – during the last 100, I started taking caffeine in the form of cups of coke or mtn dew around mile 32. I do think this is too early since by mile 80 or so, it was having no effect, although I made great time in the middle third of the race.

* Didn’t eat enough? – I don’t think this is the issue. I’ve grabbed a lot of food around mile 87 and it didn’t help me avoid the death march, but maybe it just wasn’t enough.

Has anyone experienced this and found a specific remedy that worked for them? I’m sure each of these contributes a little bit but I really would like to know which would give me the biggest gain for my time. I’m also a bit worried that I will injure myself if I try to get in a bigger training week.",1556221043

Ultramarathon,emvey,Anyone experiencing chronic low T due to regular ultramarathon training routine?,"Hi all, my first post on reddit,hope i didnt make anything wrong.

I am a regular runner, occasionally joining to ultra's.Last September i had increased my weekly mileage considerably to get better timings at races, up to 70-75 km per week which is nothing compared to routines of many ultra runners.

After  a while, a month or so, i noticed i lost my sexual drive, started to feel tired during the day and had some difficulties in cognitive abilities(difficulty in remembering even simpliest things) 

First i visited my urologist whom then directed me to endocrinologist after diagnosing low T that might be affected from pituitary gland.( After 2 blood tests)

After third blood test, low T below the range has again been observed with lower LH and FSH (within the range but in the low end).

Doctor's conclusion was pituitary axis might have 
been negatively effected due to recent endurance trainings and adviced me to quit running for at least 3 months to give blood for further diagnosis.

Now, i am at rest until the end of June looking forward to get better test results, along with better energy,sexual drive and cognitive capacity:)

I am aware that endocrine system is very sensitive to all factors including stress and negative thinking, etc. And i may be extending my recovery period unintentionally while my mind is stuck on this for two months.

Thus, i wanted to know if any others have faced with such complications through their training routines and if yes, how did you overcome this?

Ultramarathon,Tchaps1993,Nutrition during 100K in 15hours,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aiming at a maximum time of 15hours for a 100K on the 8th of august. (would love 12hours but 15hours is max)

Now my training is going wel, and i planned to alternate running and walking between aid stations.(1hour each)

I calculated that i will lose aroudn 7000Kcal during these 15hours, i simply thought that i could drink and eat heavy Kcal food at the end of a run phase and let it digest during the walking phase.

&amp;#x200B;

But now that ive done reading they say that you can only digest 240Kcal each hour during ultra's and your source should be Carbs.

&amp;#x200B;

But every documentary that ive seen they eat burgers,pizza and other fatty foods. 

(like gary robbins in barkley and the docu about the alpachian trail)

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions, can i only eat 240Kcal every hour? And what about fatty foods? 

Im used to eating a lot because i did bodybuilding so 500ml drinks of 600Kcal i just sip in 20seconds. But it seems that i should stay away from all those.",1555662787

Ultramarathon,bugbu,Two months until 50M,"Hello. I'm running a pancake flat 50 mile race that's basically all road. The race is on the 8th of June. Some of it is on pavement, some on dirt road. 

Above all I want to finish that run under the 12 hour cut off. It would be great to get under 10 or even better than that. But I've fallen in love with the feeling of running long and that's what I'm looking for with this challenge. 

Background:

* 22 year old guy
* Been running three years
* Longest run is a road marathon six months ago (3:56)
* Distance ran in past 365 days is 2500 miles or 4000 km (thx smashrun)
* I've done three hour runs for funsies maybe 20 times.
* I can comfortably run and sustain 50 miles / 80 km weeks while feeling good and not getting injured (knock on wood)
* typical week is 6 days running, shortest run usually about 50 minutes, sometimes doing double days and a long run of 2-3 hours in the weekend
* In 2019 I've done 5 runs in the 3 hour range, longest being 3,5 hours and averaging about 50 miles a week
* Oh and I bike commute to college so normal week is about 2-3 hours of bike commutes

 

What I'm thinking for the time until then:

* Keep running and peak with a week of something like 75 miles/ 120 km
* Do additional (1-3) more long runs of 3-4 hours while testing everything out (race start time is at 8 am, food, water and so on.)
* Get increasingly anxious about running 50 miles

**Is there something glaringly obvious I should consider?** 

**Should I do a run up to or even over 4 hours?**

**Should I run my last long run 3 weeks out? That's what I did for my marathon and it worked out fine. Are there different ideas with ultra distances?**

Any feedback is much appreciated! If you have experience with road ultras, please share what it was like. I'm also interested in hearing about those who jumped from marathon to 50 miles.

Thanks!",1555261879
Ultramarathon,lazzybone,tips for someone who has been running my whole life but never as a runner.,"1) to clarify the topic sentence: I have been running either because the very nature of my primary sport (soccer) requires people to run. I have also been running as a supplement conditioning tool to other sports. I also ran track for a few years but never really trained for it outside of track season. If PRs matter, let me know but I dont think they matter too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto my question: TLDR version: should I build up my speed/gear my training more towards shorter (mile/5k/10k) distances for now, or should I just focus on Ultra training?  

&amp;#x200B;

for the past year I have gotten into running as my primary sport. I have only raced 5k 2 times thus far since making it more full time (due to life circumstance, location, fires, and other variables). However, both times I have felt more fit than normal, and I believe I couldve improved my PR significantly throughout the past year if I had more races (I did PR in 5k by 5 seconds). Sometime between the two 5ks, I started looking at ultra marathons: watching vids, reading, etc. And they sounded pretty interesting based off of what people were saying. Therefore I ran my first 50K a few weeks ago and I absolutely loved it! I definitely want to do more ultras, and I want to do them as well as I can in them over the long course. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I know my ability over shorter/quicker distances is not where it could be. I know (based on how my running feels now compared to 1.5 years ago and how my last two races went), that if I were given 3-6 races over the course of the next training block that I could for sure improve my time significantly. I kind of have a thought process that if my speed in shorter distances is better, that will make me a stronger runner in general and will help to prepare myself for longer distances (this is just an example not actual times: if I can run a 5k at 6 min/mile pace, how can I expect to run a 50K at 7:30 min/mile pace? But if I can bring down my 5k pace to 5:00/mile or even 5:20/mile then how much easier will 7:30/mile feel, and how much longer will I be able to hold that pace?) That is what I am thinking could make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all is this: what would be a better long term benefit. If I spend the next 2, 3, 4 years working on my shorter distances and training for shorter distances? Or would it be more beneficial for me to just jump straight into ultra marathon training?",1555219755
Ultramarathon,SpecialFX99,I need some perspective after failing my last long run before the race!,I'm training for a 50 miler which will be the third time I've gone that distance or more.

The trails were all sloppy mud and this was the first day this year when it's been hot/humid/sunny during a long training one. I just ran out of gas. Am I doomed for my race or should I just chalk it up to a bad combination of circumstances and not worry about it? I know better than to try and make it up.

Ultramarathon,huppa13,Chafing Question (inner arm),"Howdy everyone, fantastic fueling hints/tips from y'all last go so I thought I'd ask here again. Did one of my longer training runs on Friday on friday (28km) and after I had some horrible chafing on my inner arm. Kinda in the triceps/bottom of my arm where underarm hair extends to (weird description, I know). I had had a problem on my left arm in this area after a shorter run on Wednesday and had myself taped up fairly well. Tape eventually fell off during rainstorm this run on Friday. When I was showering I noticed both arms were raw. 

&amp;#x200B;

I assume this is from my running vest. Any suggestions? Wear sleeves? Vaseline? 

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps this is the vest I'm using.:

I'm really excited about having decided to participate in this amazing race in Kazakhstan 12 May: [https://www.peaksandpenguins.com/the-greatest-race/](https://www.peaksandpenguins.com/the-greatest-race/)I'ts 70 k, elevation 1450 meters.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of experience, I did two 50 K races last year with climb/descent of about 3000 meters. I finished both in the middle of the pack, with pain on the outside of my right knee during the last 1000 meters of descent or so. 

During this winter I have not been running much, only 5-10ks on threadmill 1-2 times a week. I have however been cross-country skiing and am generally fit.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: How can I best prepare for the 70K in only 6 weeks? My thinking is that I should surely manage the distance, by a combination of walking and running - and only 1450 meters of  descent should be bearable for my knees - and good strenghtening for races later in the summer.

Ultramarathon,ribenademon,How Foolish Am I Being?,"Hey,

I've decided/been encouraged by others to take part in an ultra event in October. It's 50 miles and you have up to 16.5 hours to do it. I am very up for it and I am mentally disciplined in terms of being willing to train. The course area is coastal and I am very familiar with large sections of the course as I live nearby. It's advertised as being walkable, but I think most people who do it are runners.

I've never run any sort of marathon, furthest I've run before is 10km. I am a big hiker and I am personally confident I can do the pace/distance at a mixture of fast walk and hustle/jog certainly if I train. But you know, that's me being confident from hiking, I've never attempted something so epic before.

I've found https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/ultra/a774983/16-week-50-mile-ultra-marathon-training-schedule/
Does following this with some additional big hikes following the route sound like a good plan/likely to lead to success?

I would measure success for me as finishing within the time limit, and super, mega success being 14 hours to finish.

How nuts does this sound?

How can I improve my chances of success?",1553372995

Ultramarathon,huppa13,Running 50k in the city on my own (questions),"Good morning lovely people!

As the title says I'm planning a run of 50k here in my city. I've never run formal races just like to run on my own and have over time worked my way up to this distance. I did 26.2 (4h57m) a few years and recently did 13.1 (2h16m) two weeks ago.

 I was disappointed with the 26 2 bc I was too ambitious with my hill climbing ability and was forced to walk several parts. This time I've been selecting and trying certain parts of my planned route during my training runs.

Black bladder black... (Supposed to be ""bla bla bla"" but I'm leaving it).....my questions:


1. I'm shooting for under 6 hrs, does that sound reasonable? Or too cautious?

2. Fueling tips on what to take? Took nuts yesterday on a run and found difficulty eating and  swallowing them. Basically ended up with crunchy peanut butter in my mouth.

3. I have a vest that carries 1L bladder and two 500ml water bottles. In the past I've put a sugar/salt mixture for rehydration.

The trail is dirt and in *very* good condition (like an ordinary track you might find the general public on), with no major technical challenges. It's a constant slope — we will either be heading up or down at all times, with virtually no flat sections.

Ultramarathon,newbornrunner,It doesn’t always get worse.,"I finished my first ever ultra race: 24h indoors timed ultra. This was basically a couch-to-24h story in one year.

Out of all the things I had read about ultra racing, the most important one was that ”it doesn’t always get worse”. What I somehow missed was that it can get darn hard before it gets better. And then it gets ever worse, only to get better again. And again..

I didn’t really appreciate the distance and how the difficulties don’t scale linearly from 6h to 24h. This is very clear from my comment history. I was naive, stupid, and arrogant. Now I’m in pain and know better.

Anyway, to the race. First 9h were smooth sailing. I ran just like I practised (ie. too fast, as I still struggle to maintain slow but efficient pace), covering over 75km during that time. Half an hour later I was sitting in the loo, spraying brown liquid all over the toilet. An hour later I was totally dehydrated, energy depleted and clueless how to get my body to work again.

At 12h mark I was eventually able to get my body moving at sustainable pace again, but running caused another spray painting episode. Finally at 13h, I had covered the first 100km and decided to have an hour break to fix my sh•t (literally :).

Coming back to the track was a humbling experience. All the walking I did to recover from the previous episode had caused major blisters to both of my feet. Running felt good in legs and feet but was pretty much impossible due to my stomach, so I just had to suffer the pain of walking.

During the next 9 hours, I slowly and painfully covered 5km at a time, rewarding myself with a short break after each one. I used these breaks in ingest as much sugar and water as I could, as my stomach seemed to work best when I was not moving at all.

Two hours to go, I was approaching 140km mark. I got some encoraging word from a fellow runner calculating that I should have enough time to reach 150km if I just maintained a steady 9min/km pace.

Something clicked in my head. I decided to hit it. Now was the time to test if my stomach could take some serious running again. Suddenly I felt no pain in my body and I was flying faster than at any point during the race. I was literally one with my shoes (Hoka One One).

I ended up hitting 150km half an hour before the race ended. What ever was behind this final push disappeared as magically as it had appeared. I walked the last few laps for the final result of 152.5km.

I was a bit behind the magic 100mile mark (”you can basically walk 100 miles in 24h” —newbornrunner before he was born again he the fire) but given my noob background and the circumstances it could have gone worse.",1551025418

**RACE REPORT**

It was a tough day.

After wrapping up a decent training block (for the Canadian winter at least), and hot off my 2nd place finish at the San Tan Scramble 50k, I headed down to Arizona to chase a WSER Golden Ticket and compete against a stacked field of competitive ultrarunners. My game plan was set. I wanted to push from the beginning with the boys and see if I could go head to head throughout the day and come up big. It was something I hadn’t done before in my previous ultras at that distance. It was risky. I knew that. But I wanted to make my mark in the desert, and I figured with the first half being mostly flat and downhill that I could push pace and stay relatively intact.

Pre-race wasn’t terrible, but the nerves got to me a couple days before. I didn’t sleep very well coming into the race. The taper was ok, but the extremely cold weather from the polar vortex made it trickier to get what I needed in the last couple of weeks. I made it down to Phoenix after a delayed flight, quickly stopped in at race package pickup, and retreated back to my Airbnb to eat and get to bed early.

Race morning consisted of a very early wake up to get to the bus that would take us to the start line. The morning was cold, something that I was hoping for coming from the temperatures here in Canada. I fueled up on the bus, and went through my typical routine once we arrived. It was windy, cold, raining, and very muddy. The mud was sticking to the bottom of everyone’s shoes. This could be interesting.

It was finally time. Runners were called to the start line and all the boys were there. Hazen, Mocko, Senseman, King, Jones, Daniels (and more). I took my spot right in the middle of them, at the front of the gate. Let’s go. 7:00AM we were underway. The pace was fast as expected. It was cold and there was a headwind, but I was happy to be moving to get warmed up. We made our way along some sections of road before ducking under the I-17 and onto the trails. I was holding my own; a few of the guys went out quicker but I was putting down low 4 mins/km like I wanted. I was happy.

We crossed Big Bug Creek, and got a nice dose of water 5km into the race. Things were muddy on the trails at this point. Slip sliding along, I made my way through to Antelope Mesa. At times I could see the leaders ahead (Daniels, King). No problem. I made my way through without stopping, and Hazen came dashing out right in front of me. I thought, perfect let’s see if I can stick with him. I was top 5 at this point, but things were still so early that it didn’t really much matter. We made our way through some beautiful rolling trails. It was fun. Things were fairly dry now, and this section of the course was mostly downhill. We were flying. I was feeling good. At some point along there I dropped Hazen (think he had to make a pit stop), and I continued on alone into Bumble Bee Ranch.

After a very quick top up of the fluids at the aid station, I carried on my way. Out of nowhere, there was Senseman. He must have been at the aid still? Perfect, someone else to see if I can stick with. I stayed behind him as we made our way up a gradual hill. All of a sudden he stopped. I wasn’t paying much attention, but damn there was a barbed wire fence/gate! Whoops, I almost ran into Senseman (I need to open my eyes a bit more). We hopped it and carried on. Not too long after he dropped me. Hmm, I wasn’t feeling as good as I did before. I was still putting back the calories on schedule, and I didn’t feel dehydrated at all. Regardless, I pressed on into Gloriana aid and continued on my way.

It was somewhere in between Gloriana and Soap Creek that I bailed hard. I kicked something on the trail with my left foot and went down onto my left shoulder (always with the left shoulder it seems). Ow. I did some damage to my left big toenail (subungual hematoma?), and scraped myself up too. I think I knew at this point what was coming next… a world of pain for the rest of the day. I became very aware of my left foot at that point. I had a major hotspot on the arch as well (turns out it was a giant blister had formed, possibly from the river crossing, or maybe the shoe choice). The fluid buildup and pressure started underneath the toenail. Damn it. I carried on though. Hazen passed me a short while later.

I hit a bit of a climb towards Soap Creek aid, and then a long gradual downhill section. I should have been flying as I headed down. My pace should have been a lot faster. But I was in pain. I had to take it slower than I wanted. Yikes.

I made my way into the aid station, and saw my friend Karl standing there. I was shaking my head as he said I was doing great and to keep it up. The mental games had started. I told him I wasn’t feeling it, and things weren’t going great. He said to meet him at the next aid station. I quickly got out of Soap Creek and back onto the course, but less than a kilometer on, I was on the sidelines puking my guts out (and when there was nothing left, dry heaving). I felt terrible. It all hit me so quickly too. I was in pain, my stomach wasn’t agreeing with me, and my confidence was gone. Karl saw me doubled over as he drove by, and shouted out to just get to the next aid station.

It was supposed to be an easy run to Black Canyon aid. It was mostly flat, and almost all road. But damn, I was so finished. My pace slowed to a crawl. I wanted it to end. I was running a calorie deficit now that my stomach was empty. Dehydration was likely. But I figured I could get to Black Canyon and drop there, at least at where the finish line was now that the High Water Route was in effect.

I got in and Karl was waiting for me. I told him I didn’t think I could continue; I was so depleted. My face and hands were tingling. But he wouldn’t let me give up. After downing most of a can of coconut water (and not enjoying any of it, but at least it stayed down), he told me to get moving again. So I slowly shuffled back out, and he tagged along for the next couple of kilometers (fortunately pacers were allowed at this point) before heading back to the aid station. I sort of got back into it, but then it got tough again. I made it down to the river and then back up to the Black Canyon aid. I again was met by Karl, who still wasn’t letting me DNF. I knew that it was going to be a long and painful day if I continued, but the WSER lotto ticket still needed to be punched at some point in 2019. No other goals at this point mattered; the race plan was out the window.

I was sent on my way back towards Soap Creek aid and then Gloriana. I was in the pain cave the entire way. The body hurt and I wasn’t able to get many calories into my body. Brutal. Slowly I knocked off the kilometers though. I did what I could, but it wasn’t much. I saw a couple of runners I knew headed towards Black Canyon aid and exchanged pleasantries as we passed, but it didn’t distract me from what I thought was a death march at the time. I tried picking up the pace and sticking with a couple of guys that had some solid tunes going, but it didn’t last long as I quickly fell back into my slow shuffle.

I ran out of hydration in between Soap and Gloriana. My mind wasn’t working properly I think. I didn’t realize the distance between the two (or that I was going so slow that it would take a long time). I only had one handheld on me, and I polished it off pretty quickly after refueling at Soap. At least I was getting the liquids in, but then was super depleted by the time I did arrive at Gloriana. I was watching for the leaders to come by as I headed up the road towards Gloriana, but must have missed Daniels. I saw Senseman, and then Mocko. They would have had 12km left at this point, and Mocko was 3 minutes behind Senseman. I wondered if he would be able to close the gap. I continued on my way and finally made it to Gloriana.

I stayed in the aid station for over 30 minutes. I was having quite the mental battle with myself to get back out on course. I was shaking, and felt extremely cold. I slowly replenished myself with fluids and as many calories as I could take without losing it all again. The warming tent was finally fired up and I huddled around the propane heater. I seriously considered pulling the plug on my race. I didn’t think I could make it back to Soap Creek with one handheld, and I didn’t have any other equipment readily available for me (I wasn’t expecting to need more than one bottle on me or that I would still be on course at this point as the temperatures started to drop again… another mistake). Eventually something clicked and I said f it, time to go. I started back up and kept it going all the way back through Soap and into the finish line. Along the way I accidentally kicked a cactus due to the congested single track with runners in both directions. Needles went through my shoe into my right foot. I had some fun pulling those out. In the end, I made it through with a total time of 10:45:56. It took 3 hours and 46 minutes to finish the first 50km, and then 7 more hours for the last 50km as I hopped on the struggle bus for that grueling journey to the end.

It wasn’t the day I wanted unfortunately, and nowhere close to the time I was looking for. I was hoping to be able to push for longer and throw down a solid 100km PB at the very least, and even be in contention for a WSER Golden Ticket. I am thankful that I did finish and punch my lotto ticket for the 2019 season though. I’m also extremely thankful for the moral support from Karl; he kept me running when it was the last thing I wanted in the moment.

**THE DAMAGE**

* I’m going to lose my left big toenail. I’ve poked a hole through the nail to relieve the pressure and drain the fluid buildup. It’s feeling good again and I can walk on it. It will fall off within a few weeks I’m sure.
* I have many blisters on both feet. My left foot has a huge blister on the arch, and then there is an assortment of others all over my toes/feet.
* I was sunburnt on my back and legs. In my sleep deprived state early in the morning before the race, I missed some spots as I was applying sunscreen.
* I have some scrapes and bruises from my fall.
* I have the typical post-ultra general soreness in the legs and body. Nothing worrying though, it feels similar to most of my previous ultras. Par for the course.

**THE POSITIVES (always look on the bright side of life *whistles*)**

* I managed to finish and punch my 2019 WSER lotto ticket entry.
* Surprisingly, that still was my 100km PB (only my third 100km race).
* I’m pretty sure there’s some cool video footage of me on the single track towards the beginning of the race when I was loving life. I hope I get to see it.
* It was a learning experience. Now to make sure I learn from these lessons and apply them to my future races.
* I didn’t get seriously injured or die. That’s good.
* I already want to get back out and run another ultra. My thinking is that I’ve just gotten through a really bad ultra, so bring on another and it should go better, right?
* I liked my racing outfit. I thought it held up well. The Rabbit FKT 3” split shorts had some great pockets to them. Very handy. The singlet was nice too. The Salomon XA+ cap with built in neck guard was great for sun protection (much needed for my delicate Canadian skin which hasn’t seen the sun since October).

**LESSONS LEARNED**

**Foot Maintenance/Blister Prevention**

* Did I have the proper shoes? I’m not so sure. I need to find something that drains and dries well after river crossings to prevent the painful blisters that popped up for me. Maybe I didn’t break in my shoes well enough before the race either. I will be looking at my shoe selection carefully before my next race, and not select something without having logged a lot of miles in them first.
* Did I have the proper socks? I do like running in the Injinji toe socks, and have run all my ultras in them. I think they’re fine, but will be taking a look at my sock selection too.
* How can I prevent subungual hematomas from happening on course? Once every couple of ultras I bang my large toe(s) really hard, and have to suffer the consequences as the painful fluid buildup occurs over the rest of the race. Typically once the toenail falls off, I have several months of running without worry of it happening again. I guess I should just kick them off before the race right (haha). I will be looking into this more though as I can’t have it affecting my races as much as it does. Maybe it comes back to shoe selection too (or just watching my foot placements more)!

**Nutrition/Hydration**
        
* Did I have the proper nutrition/hydration? Back to the drawing board for this I think. I need my stomach to be happier. I think it was more likely that I was just pushing hard and puking was because of that, but I’ll still be looking into my nutrition and hydration plan before next race.

**Pacing**

* Did I pace myself properly? Probably not, but for this race I wanted to go out fast. I know it’s a fast course, and I know the first half is a lot faster than the second half. Maybe I should look into the Mocko strategy in an upcoming race. Start a bit slower, and work your way through the field as the race progresses. This will take even more restraint, but it’s something I could explore.

**Training Block**

* Did I have the proper training block? I actually don’t think it was completely ideal. It’s tough in winter to get the trails you need due to the snow, and the distance in a single run that should happen due to the cold. I now think I should have thrown in more of both.

**Mental Conditioning**

* Did I defeat myself mentally after things got rough? I think so. I went into a dark place pretty quick after puking, and going down hard definitely rattled me. I need to continue working on a positive attitude when running these long ultras. Things don’t always go according to plan, but something I should be able to control more is my mental game.

All in all, I have a lot of things to work on here. I’m already excited to get back into it once my body recovers. I need to get back out there and try again; I’m not going to give up. Onward and upwards!",1550709817

I am a big guy (250-260 now) with the long term goal of running ultras.  I have been walk-running to get miles in and chew the fat off.  I can run but my HR gets above the low/aerobic zone before long.

I recently walk-run-walked 26.2 miles continuously.  I feel good knowing that I can keep things moving for several hours, but am scratching my head about where to go from here.

I am torn between two approaches:

1). Keep walking / jogging long distances to shed pounds and build aerobic capacity.  Worry here is that I need to run to eventually run fast/far

2).  Practice running, even if I can’t do too much of it yet.

Ultramarathon,sbush85,How to responsibly build mileage for 50 mile and 100k goal races within the next 6 months,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly experienced ultrarunner with two goal races within the next 6 months, and I'm looking for advice on a smart, responsible training plan after a couple years off the grid.

&amp;#x200B;

Which ultramarathons, you say? Well, I was lucky enough to get drawn for the [San Juan Solstice 50](http://www.sjs50.com/index.html) in yesterday's lottery, which is 21 weeks away in June. I'm also registered for the [Never Summer 100k](http://gnarrunners.com/never-summer-100k/), which is 26 weeks away. The former is a ""B"" dress rehearsal race that I intend to run at a comfortable pace, whereas the latter is my ""A"" goal race (and a Western States qualifier).

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, San Juan Solstice is a [50-mile course](http://www.sjs50.com/course-info.html) in the San Juan Mountains (think Hardrock) with 12,000 feet of vertical gain and 12,000 feet of descent. Never Summer is a [64.2-mile course](http://gnarrunners.com/never-summer-100k/course-map-profile/) in the Rocky Mountains with 13,000 feet of vertical gain and 13,000 feet of descent.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my experience, I have [nearly 20 ultra finishes](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Stephen&amp;lname=Bush) under my belt since 2011, so I'm not worried about finishing the 50 mile or 100k distance. My concern is scaling my training in a responsible way over the next 6 months so I don't burn out or sustain an injury while in the process of rebuilding mileage and finding my rhythm again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been taking it easy since I moved to Colorado, and I haven't logged serious mileage for about 2 ½ years. My current training base is limited to weekend hikes in the Boulder, CO area.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I have 21 weeks to get into decent shape to finish San Juan Solstice, then another 5 weeks before Never Summer comes around. Again, I'm not worried about the *mental* side of sticking out 50 miles to 100km – I've been there many times before – but the *physical* aspect of building from an almost nonexistent base and getting back into finishing shape while avoiding a major setback or mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize there will be a risk of burnout or injury regardless of my exact training approach – I'm looking for advice to help minimize that risk.

&amp;#x200B;

That's about it. Thanks so much for any advice you can offer me!

# Training

After the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, I shut it down for a few weeks to give myself a bit of recovery, only running to help maintain my base (and because I like running way too much to completely stop… it’s impossible for me)! I picked it back up afterwards and started my build, mostly running road due to snow hitting the Canadian Rockies (it’s tough to hit my pace targets while slogging through the snowy trails). I focused more on speed while building back to a peak week of 145km. The plan for the San Tan Scramble 50k was to use it as training for my upcoming A race, the Black Canyon 100k (hunting for a WSER Golden Ticket). I figured a desert race 1.5 months in advance by the same race organizer as the BC100 would be a perfect way to get my feet wet in 2019  and get that confidence up. Unfortunately, a week before the race I  pulled my hamstring and shut things down almost completely, hoping that  it would heal in time for the race. I was very worried, but knew that the hay was in the barn and rest was much more important than trying to go through a standard taper.

# Pre-Race

My pre-race was very normal, just the way it should be. I don’t like surprises, and try to keep travel stress to a minimum so I can focus on prepping myself for the race ahead. I booked a flight and flew into Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport, arriving at lunch on the Friday before the race. I picked up the rental car, went and grabbed some sunscreen, and spent the rest of the resting, fueling up, picking up my race package, and prepping my gear. The hamstring was feeling ok, but I hadn’t actually tested it in a week, so anything could happen race day!

# Race

I rolled into the venue at 6AM, after getting up at 5AM for a quick breakfast. It was cold, around 5 or 6 degrees Celsius. Yes! My Canadian blood was loving it after flying in from the Calgary winter (which has been mild, but still). Heaters were on and all my fellow competitors were huddled around in winter gear, looking a bit frozen. I did my usual stretching and pre-race shaking out, and jumped into the corral with a few minutes to race start. I took a look at the competition, from the entrant’s list I knew there were a few guys that might be able to do sub 4 hours. But no one was stepping up to the front of the line! I went right to the front. Let’s do this.

Right at 7AM we got underway for Lap 1. Within the first kilometer, I dropped everyone. The plan was to hit the first lap hard before the sun rose. I wanted to capitalize on the perfect temperatures before the day started heating up. The first  lap was uneventful. I was loving it. It felt great to finally stretch  the legs after a week of minimal running. The hamstring felt fine! I was carrying my handheld and some gel, so I didn’t spend any time at the aid stations as I ran through. The desert was also an interesting change in scenery, and I tried to take it all in as I ran. The course featured a clockwise-counterclockwise-clockwise loop direction, so I knew I had the opportunity to see how much of a lead I had on the other runners each lap. I came into the finish and immediately turned around, eager to keep that gap I had created. My first lap time was 1:12:24. A minute or two faster than the initial plan, but that was no sweat. Things were working for me.

Lap 2. I had a gap between myself and second of 5 minutes. I passed him… wait a second was that Cody Reed?? I kept going but it really looked like him. I didn’t see him on the entrant’s list though last I checked, what’s going on? I kept pushing and felt pretty good for most of lap 2. I kept cool by dumping water on my sun sleeves and head, but could feel it heating up (by my standards at least)! Towards the end I was thinking, oh boy it’s going to get even hotter. But I have to keep moving. My second lap time was 1:15:17, a few minutes slower. No problem, I figured my first lap would be my fastest. I just  wanted to maintain around a 1:15 for my third lap and I would be good!

Lap 3. Oooooo things started to be a bit of a grind. I passed by the mystery bearded man again. Ok that has to be Cody Reed. Super cool that  I’m racing a Coconino Cowboy, but I knew he was hunting me! I needed to push if I wanted to stay in front of him and show that I can run with the best. But I could feel the gap was closing. I was slowing down. I kept up the gels and hydration and continued trying to stay cool. On the climbs my groin was super tight and painful though. Not pleasant at all! Regardless, I kept fighting. At this point I was just hoping to have enough of a lead to hold him off. About 500m-1km from the last aid station, I took a look back. Bright orange shorts, there’s Cody. He’s pushing. I figured it was a matter of time before he got to me, and then I’d have to see if I could hang on.

Cody caught up to me right after the last aid station. We chatted for a second and I confirmed that yes, it was Mr. Reed himself. I told him he’s killing it and that he might have me here. He lit me up haaaard, leaving me in the dust, all the way up the biggest hill in the race of course. At this point I think I resigned the fact that I was racing for second. By the time I got to the top I couldn’t even see him! I pushed as best as I could down and into the finish. 2nd place! I’ll take it. Turns out Cody was only 3 minutes in front of me, but he put that distance on me in the last couple of kilometers. Crazy!

# Post-Race

My first race of 2019 was in the bag, and I couldn’t be happier about how I performed. Going in not at 100%, and not knowing if my hamstring would even hold up, to battling a Coconino Cowboy and placing 2nd overall (and 3rd top time in race history, behind Cody Reed and Charlie Ware, two ultrarunning beasts!), I would call it a success.

For the rest of the day, I enjoyed it in the sun at the finish line, eating all the delicious Freak Bros. pizza, chatting with Cody about 2019 race plans, and watching the other runners come into the finish. I had a late  flight back to Calgary, and by the end of the night I was asleep in my own bed. Perfect.

Thank you to Aravaipa Running for hosting the race, and to the volunteers for your help on course! I had a great time; it was definitely worth the quick trip down. Oh and big congratulations to Cody on the win and new course CR! I have a feeling this will be my best year yet, and am excited that it has started with a bang. Since the race I’ve been focused on recovery, trying to get my body back into gear here for one final big push into Black Canyon 100. Watch out!

Also took up Jiu Jitsu 3 years ago but wanted something even more painful.

I got shown the light from Goggins - his podcast with Rogan a month ago woke me up to what seems to be a magical land of pain called ultra marathons.  And an overall desire to see what I am capable of.

Ultramarathon,-Overlast-,"50K, 1 year after first marathon","Hi, I need some advice

Some information about me:
Age: 20
Sports history: played soccer and tennis untill I was 15 ish, then occasionally went to the gym.


Last year, a friend of mine challenged me to run a marathon with him. We both had very little running experience at the time. The marathon we signed up for was in 4 months, so we started training. I had problems with some well-known injuries like runner's knee and shin splints. Our goal was just to finish and we both did,  in 4:28. 

After the marathon my legs hurt a lot longer than they should (couple of months). I did not run a lot because of that, but I started running again at the end of last year.

This year (in 3 months), we are going to try to finish under 4 hours. However, and this is where I need some advice, I would really like to run a 50k this summer, and the only one that I can participate in (due to a very full agenda) is 6 weeks after the marathon. 

Should I run the 50k? My goal would be to just finish without serious injuries.

Thanks!

Ultramarathon,Simco_,How was your 2018? What you got planned for 2019?,"2018

Got in a good group of races that begins to give me a feel for my ultimate ultra goal of doing the Grand Slam.  Finished my first training season with a coach and am really glad I made that choice.  I feel it's a worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to jumpstart their performance and who may suffer from accountability issues.  Several days I wouldn't have run except I knew I'd have to tell my coach I chose not to.

Here's some mini-race reviews.

**Zion 100**:  Visiting Zion National Park is fantastic and worth the trip.  There's like two or three great views in the race.  Course is predominantly MTB trails or jeep road.  

**Bighorn 100**:  DNFd at the turnaround.  Learned altitude isn't just throwing up or migraines but can also just be lethargy and no motivation.  Beautiful course and the forest is a good day trip if you happen to find yourself with an unexpected extra day.

**Ute 100**:  Visiting Canyonlands, Arches, etc. and then going into what is basically CO terrain is really awesome.  The gravel roads here are brutal but the course overall is fantastic.

**Grindstone 100**:  This shit is hard even though it has like 25 gimme miles.  

I kept up with all the money I spent related to each race and I thought it may benefit some people to see those numbers.

Ultramarathon,fricklefrog,Questions/advice for someone looking to do a 100 miler,"So I know what I want to do is not necessarily the smartest or best way to do it. What I want to do is this: jump straight into a 100 mile run/race by the end of this spring without running any other ultra distance beforehand (maybe a couple training runs that are longer but not official events). Like I said, I know it’s not the best idea, but I want to do it just because I know it will hurt and I want to see if I can actually do it or not.

So, you probably have your thoughts on someone jumping straight into a 100 mile without racing anything over 10K thus far. I am open to hear your thoughts, and I will take them into consideration

Also my running coach has problems with it as well. She wants me to run at least one smaller ultra beforehand. My biggest concern is I don’t know how I should respectfully go about discussing it with her. Is it fine to say “no, jumping straight into 100 miles is something I want to do.” Or is it best to take her advice fully... or just to tell her that I considered her advice but want to jump straight into it? Maybe I could say I am willing to do a 50k but as a training run? But I want the 100 mile to be my first official ultra event. ",1546265817

Ultramarathon,newbornrunner,How to spare lower back muscles during a 24h,"Hi.

Due to some circumstanses I (40y male) will be participating a 24h indoor race next February. I don’t have a long history of running (~1 year including one 4h marathon last fall) but my training (6h-8h a week) seems to be going okey.

The issue I noticed during my last two 5h training runs is that my lower back is pretty spent after the run. I tried different run/walk cycles (15+5 vs 2+4) but didn’t notice any difference in back soreness.

I feel that I can reach 6h but not sure about 12h, let alone 24h.. Is there anything in technique, training, or otherwise that I still could try to improve the situation?",1545635395
Ultramarathon,nothingtosay23,Want to attempt my first 50M race. Could people help me with a couple questions?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

First time posing, excuse any errors. Could people help me with a couple 50M race questions?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Trained and ran a 50K 3 weeks ago. I really enjoy running and want to attempt a 50M soon, while I have built up my stamina and have time to train during the day. However, between my 50K and now I've had to take a break (at least from a rigid training schedule). I had a bit of pain behind me knee I wanted to heal and needed to study. I still ran during these 3 weeks, I'd estimate between 6-10 miles, 4 times a week. With this background information in mind, can people give me some suggestions on how to build on my 50K training and aim to run a 50M? I don't have a specific race picked out, but I would prefer to run one in January or February. I really don't know how many more weeks I need to train, how long my longest run should be seeing that I ran a 50K recently, etc. I don't know if I lost some stamina and need to rebuild it.
2.  I run in midwest, and the average temperature I've trained in is between 35-40. Most of the 50M races I've seen, in the next two months, are in the southeast/southwest, with average temperatures in the 70s. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous this is gonna be pushing how hot I can run in, especially over 50 miles. Has anyone dealt with this potential problem and can lend me some advice? Maybe I'm making too big of a deal out of it.

Ultramarathon,emilysost,60K training suggestions,"I am thinking about signing up for a 60K next November in Central Park, New York City. I am not experienced -- I've run on and off for 9+ years, but only ran my first marathon this year. I've got another marathon in May but I'm already thinking about what's next after that.

I live in NYC and run in Central Park multiple times a week, so the 60K seems perfect. However, I'm seeing a lot of training plans for 50K and 50 mile distances, with little in between. I don't trust myself to make my own plan -- should I use a 50K plan with longer long runs? Or train for a 50 miler and be over prepared (this is more intimidating as I work full time and schedule can be pretty tight)? Any thoughts are appreciated.",1544316418

Ultramarathon,SpagettSpookedYa,Advice on first 50k,"Hi all, 

I've made the decision that I'd like to run a 50k. I ran my first marathon last March, and generally I'm in shape now that I can run a half marathon on the weekend; so I'd have some training to do for sure but I'm not starting from zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Charleston, SC, where my training is likely to fall off a bit in the summer when it becomes super hot and humid. I don't mind traveling for the race as I don't think it's something I'm likely to do again. My question for you all is: How the heck do I pick a race to sign up for? Would it be smarter to pick something in May 2019? Or wait until after summer and train for something more like March 2020? How do I know which ultra courses are worth the effort, and which ones might be kind of crappy? 

&amp;#x200B;

Marathon seemed easy to pick – I just ran a road one where my parents lived in Indiana.

My Garmin Fenix 5s is 10 months old. The problem I'm having now where it will not charge is something that started happening a couple months ago. At first it wouldn't charge unless I held the cord 'just right' and then very carefully set the watch down on the table without moving it. Very recently, a few times, I have actually had to hold the charging cable into the watch with some concerted firmness, and after about 30 seconds it would start charging as long as I held it like that.

Sadly, it is at 1% and I cannot seem to get it to recharge. I have the original charging cable and an additional replacement cable, neither one works.

**Report:**

What a ride! You would think 3 days of solid racing through some extreme conditions, tough competition, and a crazy course would break you, but I was so happy to be out there. I was able to take it all in and enjoy the experience the entire time out on course. Events like these can really turn you sideways in a hurry, and I knew coming in that the weather could play a big factor both physically and mentally. Being able to prepare for the expected conditions ahead of time and telling myself that at the very least I wanted to have a weekend of running and fun in the mountains definitely played a factor in my success. Proud to be able to stand on the podium with some awesome runners!

I’ve went ahead and broken down each of the days of racing below.

**Day 1: Blood (4.5km, 1000m gain)**

I arrived in Golden to some cold and wet conditions, with some off and on rain. To be expected though! I had planned for this. With 4 hours to kill, I spent my time at the bottom of the Kicking Horse, checking in, relaxing, and checking my gear for the upcoming climb. After suiting up with an hour or so to go, I stayed warm in the chalet with a steadily increasing amount of runners all seeking shelter from the conditions. I found some running friends to talk to while I passed the time, trying to relax and go through the usual pre-race routine of stretching and staying loose. 10 minutes out, I took a couple of gels and went for a bit of a warmup run. I hadn’t run a VK before, so I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect. I knew that I had a full weekend of racing ahead of me, so I didn’t want to destroy myself the first day. I did have a target of 50 minutes in mind, and to keep the top runners within a couple of minutes. I was fortunate enough to have a running buddy (thanks Alex!) suggest using poles ahead of the race weekend. I bought a good pair and got some solid practice with them prior to race day.

Alright, time to race! Typical lineup at the start, and we’re off. I have my poles in hand and ready to go. I stick with the lead group. I knew one runner (Eric Carter, holds the CR for the climb) was just doing the VK, and to not worry about him. I look over and find myself running with a dude wearing a straw hat, flannel top with the sleeves ripped off, and jean shorts? Who the hell is this guy? I find out later on that his name is Justin, and he’s quite the character on course (and really fast too)! So four of us are together for the first kilometer or so (Eric, Dave, Justin, and myself). Eric breaks off from the group at the flat section 1.5km in. Dave follows. I stick with Justin and keep grinding, knowing they’re up ahead. I’m feeling good at this point, no concerns at all. It’s cold but I’m not feeling it. I have lots left in the tank.

We round the corner at 2.5km aid station and I’m right on my target time, ~21 minutes. Perfect. The steepest section of the course awaits. it’s 30-40% grade. You’re literally running up a black diamond ski run. I’m glad I had poles at this point. It’s steep, wet, and slippery. I’m just a bit ahead of Justin at this point, and we start passing some of the ‘Half Pint’ runners, those that are doing the 2.8km climb and started further up on the mountain. Most stepped aside as we called out that we were passing. Great etiquette for the most part.

3.2km in now. Here’s where it got fun. We jump onto some single track. I know Eric is in the lead with Dave behind him, but couldn’t tell where they were at this point. It’s foggy, there are lots of other runners from the other race, and wait, what’s this? Snow? I heard that there was snow at the higher elevations, but couldn’t actually see it due to the cloud cover. Crazy! I get into the single track ahead of Justin, but after a quick glance behind, I knew he was right behind me. It’s a race for 3rd! Not long after, Justin catches me and calls out to pass. I let him by, but stay right on his heels. I check my watch, and know we’re down to the last 500 metres. I’m not going down without a fight!

After a bit more climbing, I hear the gondola. I can’t see anything still (so foggy!) but I was thinking, this is it! The course is flattening out, it must be the finish. I see the flags, they’re only 50m ahead! Fortunately, the course widened out for me. I quickly shift gears and manage to sprint right by Justin in the last couple of meters. 3rd place by 0.9 seconds! I’ll take it! 49:42 chip time, 18 seconds ahead of my target. Awesome! Feeling tired but not completely drained. Even better.

Dave is waiting at the top for us. Justin and I immediately jump into the gondola with him and we head down to find some warm clothing and shelter, with introductions on the way down. Day 1 is done!

**Day 2: Sweat (58km, 2500m gain)**

What a crazy race! Such a fun time slogging through the mud and rain, and running ridgelines with snow up to my ankles and shins. Super happy with the result. Was trying for a sub 6 result but the conditions didn’t make it easy! No worries there though, probably had more fun running in these ridiculous conditions.

The morning of the race was typical. The body was feeling pretty good from the VK the afternoon before. My stomach wasn’t happy with me, but I realized it was just the nerves. Damn I still have to work on that. Still managed to fuel up alright, and then headed over to the start line.

Conditions at the start were as expected. Cold and rainy. Knowing this ahead of time, it was fine with me. I enjoy the cloudy cold days for running more than the sun anyway.

Off we went at 7:30am. I was part of the lead pack, along with Dave, Justin, and Joren, with others in behind. The first few km of road were uneventful, other than Justin diving into the bushes yelling “cops” when he saw our police escort. Hilarious, gotta love when guys have fun at the beginning. Lightens things up. No one was pushing pace too crazy, seemed like we were all getting warmed up and into the rhythm.

Into the single track, I had my first fall of the day. Wake up call! The trails were really slick with lots of mud and water. Good to know. Dusted myself off quick and kept at it. Dave went down hard on a bike boardwalk a few minutes later. It looked painful. Ouch! Justin was still hooting and hollering away as we made our way up. Hahaha awesome.

At this point it was just Dave, Justin, myself and Joren. We slogged our way up to the first aid station, already soaked at this point. No problem, to be expected. Dave made his move and ran right through the aid station, breaking away. Justin broke off shortly after. I secured third position with Joren a bit back in 4th. I was on track for what I wanted my pace to be at this point. Perfect. Grabbed my poles too from my drop bag for the upcoming climb.

Into the climb. I feel like I’m not the greatest at climbs. I think I held my own, happy that I had poles (thanks for the suggestion Alex!) with me due to the sheer mud and water and some super steep sections. Joren caught up and powered on by me. Goat! I was sitting 4th position. Damn. Ok left foot right foot, keep on going.

Made it to the second aid station. Quick stop again, refueled, and on my way. The pizza smelled so good, wish I could have stayed for a slice! Still pretty well on time, maybe 5 minutes back from where I wanted.

Up we go again! More climbing. Never ending! I knew once I made it to aid station 3, I would be fine for the second half of the race. But wait, snow! Damn this is getting crazy! Snow accumulation up to the ankles and even shins as I made my way up to the top and along the ridge. It was crazy but super cool. I was cold but damn how awesome is it to be racing on the top of a mountain traversing a ridgeline in September postholing, slipping and sliding and just trying not to fall off the mountain or roll an ankle. Ok estimated times are out the window. That’s ok though. I figured everyone would have to be careful and slow down to make sure they survived this section. Passed some dude who had built a snowman. Perfect.

I kept grinding away, hands freezing, but taking it all in. The craziness of the conditions actually kept me in a really good mood. Weird to think about it now I guess, but damn it was great up there. Too bad it was so foggy, apparently the views are amazing along the ridge! At last, I hear the gondola. Excellent, I’m at aid station 3.

I ripped into aid station 3, quickly refueling, dropping my poles off, and got out of there. Time to get off this mountain and thaw myself out! Chatted quickly with the runuphill.ca guy and he gave me some good intel on the guys ahead. Thanks!

I powered down the mountain. Boot skiing, sliding, all the way until below the snow line. I was on the hunt for the podium again. Feeling great to not have to climb anymore. Towards the bottom of the ski hill I caught up with Joren. Perfect! Said hi and kept on rolling. Still feeling good.

Kept it moving and started pushing the pace to see if I could gain some ground on positions 1 and 2. The km were just rolling by. Still feeling great. Good headspace. Then boom. I went down hard. Really hard. Bailed and landed on my left shoulder. Damn it. It hurt. Did a quick assessment, I could move it still. I think that’s a good sign. It hurt, but I needed to keep moving. A quick thought of Kilian Jornet at Hardrock 2017 crept into my head. The fall rattled me though. I got into aid station 4 and got out as quick as I could.

The next several km were starting to get a bit more grindy. The shoulder stopped hurting so much, but I fell off my pace. I didn’t want to go down again. I picked my foot placements more carefully as I went down the single track.

At this point I was catching up to some 30k runners. Spirits were lifted. They were awesome and let me go right on by. Words of encouragement helped break up this section. Fantastic! Everyone is so nice on course. I love it.

A helicopter kept buzzing overhead. I thought that was odd. I heard from one of the 30k runners that someone was injured and it was search and rescue looking for them? I never saw the injured person though. I hope they’re ok.

Kept on moving down the single track, counting the km on my watch. I knew I could keep my pace, but the paranoia of someone catching me kept my head on a swivel.

Finally, the road! Time to stretch the legs. I knew once I hit the road I could throw down some faster km on the stable ground. Off I went, putting some 4:10s down as I made my way into the finish. With one last look behind me, I knew I secured a podium spot. Hell yeah!!

Finish line, boom. Done! 3rd place. 6:08:00 chip time. What a crazy course, what an awesome race. I’m happy with my result. Didn’t break 6h but hey, I’ll take those crazy conditions for the experience at least!

Congrats to Dave and Justin, you guys are beasts! Nice job on first and second place.

As always thank you to all the volunteers and organizers, you were all so helpful and friendly! It makes things so awesome when you get into an aid station and everyone is in a great mood. Especially with the weather as it was. You guys rock!

Time for more recovery for the rest of the day 23k tomorrow to wrap up Golden! Needed to stay sharp and throw down again to secure 3rd overall.

**Day 3: Tears (23km with 700m gain)**

Up and at it, not as early as day 2 though! Body was feeling good considering, but my left shoulder was being cranky from the fall the day before. I made my way back to the start line at the square, and off we went.

Dave thought it would be funny to throw down 3:30 – 4:00 min/km pace right off the bat, just to see if anyone would join! Of course I was sticking with him, and Justin was right there too, along with another runner just doing the 23k, Adrien. I needed ~5 minutes 30 seconds lead time on Justin to take 2nd overall. We enter the forest and start slogging it out.

It was uneventful for the most part, Dave, Justin, and I just talking away as we raced. At about 8km in, Justin needed to re-tie his shoe lace. Dave and I pressed on. I started pushing a bit harder, trying to widen that gap that was given to me. Dave and I continue shooting the shit, talking about past races and future plans. Helped pass the time on a day where it could get achy and tough if you’re solo. The single track trails we were on were very flowy, and we were able to keep up a solid running pace throughout.

It was getting close to the end. Dave and I were on the switchbacks down towards Golden. I didn’t see Justin. How much of a gap did I have? I had no idea. I emptied the rest of my handheld, and as soon as we hit the flats with 2k to go, I pushed. I broke off from Dave immediately as I was initially doing 3 min/km pace. I wanted to see if he would stick with me. He yelled out something along the lines of “it’s all you!” and with a thumbs up I kept on going. I managed to stretch my legs and average ~3:30 min/km for the last 2 km of the race. It felt good.

Finally, a win! I came across the line at 1:47:48 for first place of the day. About a minute after, Dave came across for second. Now where was Justin? I watched the clock intently, counting down the time. I still needed another minute and a half when he rounded the corner! Justin crossed the line 3rd for the day, and secured 2nd overall for the weekend.

So I wasn’t able to put enough of a gap between Justin and I to take over 2nd place overall, but I had a great time anyway! 3rd place overall isn’t too shabby! Thanks for the awesome competition and sportsmanship out there guys, it was great!

### Next Race

Next up for me is the Toronto Waterfront Marathon (completely different than my bread and butter in the trails)! After that I've registered for the Black Canyon 100k in February to continue chasing my Western States dream.

Ultramarathon,Matosinhoslover,Race Report: Wienerwald Ultra Trail,"This race was my second ultra and my first distance longer than 50 kilometers. I had signed up more or less without knowing a lot about the region or the race. This was the first edition and I had never before been to Wienerwald – the forest around Vienna.

I found the event by browsing the ITRA homepage and looking for a race that would give me another 3 UTMB points in order to get into the lottery for the OCC 2019.

My first impression was that the area seemed to be beautiful, yet quite easy to run. Probably easier than the coastal terrain of the Jurassic Coast where I ran my first ultra in June this year.

I convinced a friend to come with me for his first ultra distance and we traveled to the village of Purkersdorf, just outside of Vienna.



**Kilometer 0 to 15:** The race started at 7 a.m. on the main square in Purkersdorf. There were 130 participants for the 55 k, 35 for the 110 k and 12 for the 100 miles. Overall it was a classic line-up of nervous and over-equipped trail runners. The first two kilometers led us out of the town and of course everyone started to run at a way too fast pace, as it is in the beginning of almost every race.

In the weeks prior to the race I had some problems with my right leg, wondering if it was shin splints or even a stress fracture. After an x-ray and even a MR showed no signs of any serious injury I decided to the give the race a shot even if I was a bit anxious about the pain and how it would develop under such a long distance.

My legs were feeling stiff and my heart rate was too high – it’s never easy to get over anxiety on race day.

The course led into the forest and over rolling hills. The trails were more like tractor roads and without any technical difficulties. I could run or walk uphill without having to look at my feet the whole time. Something that saves a lot of energy.

The first hill included 200 meters of elevation gain and the second one around onehundred meters. As soon as runners of the same speed were sorted loosely into groups, I met the same people several times. I overtook them, they overtook me, we had a little chat and it felt good to be in this together.


**Kilometer 15 to 25:** The first aid station was at kilometer 16 and I only stopped to fill up my water bottles and to eat a slice of apple. I had a big bowl of müsli for breakfast and ate some gels and energy bars I brought in my pack. In hindsight it would have been better to eat more at the first aid station as I started to feel weary not long after. Feeling hungry or not is nothing to go by – just eat what you know is good for you.

The trail was now quite steep, both up and downhill. For some time it didn’t bother me too much but then fatigue was creeping up my legs. I stopped for some short stretches to feel less tight and stiff.


**Kilometer 25 to 36:** The steep inclines kept on coming and I started to feel worse, both mentally and physically. Every uphill seemed longer and the downhills were tough on my legs. I felt nauseous and didn’t want to eat any more disgustingly sweet gels and bars. The landscape was still beautiful but I wasn’t really having any of it at that point. My mind was all set for the next aid station and the break that I would take there.


**Kilometer 36 to 45:** Coming into the aid station I felt quite sick. I took off my shoes, set my phone to charge and filled up my bottles. Texting with a friend who wanted to know what I had eaten so far made me realize that it wasn’t enough at all. I felt like my stomach was full of gels and sugary water but consuming about 300 calories in 5 hours of running and hiking was really not a lot. I forced myself to eat a banana and to drink some coke – and it worked! I felt better almost instantly.

Before leaving the aid station I mixed a super strong tailwind energy drink with about 300 calories in 0.5 liters. I continued my journey and everything felt so much easier. I put on some music and even danced a little bit to the music as I walked through the forest and the fields.

My enthusiasm lessened over time and I started to look forward to the next, and last, aid station at kilometer 45.


**Kilometer 45 to 55:** Reaching the aid station, I was quick to fill up with banana and coke again but it didn’t quite do it’s magic as it had done one and a half hour before. I was tired and no amount of carbohydrates would change that fact. My legs felt so stiff and running downhill hurt in every muscle. Running uphill as well.

I continued together with a local runner and we entertained each other with little stories about other races. Getting this done with was easier while not concentrating too much on negative feelings. The kilometers after the aid station were basically only uphill, a hill that would not end. I looked on my watch every minute to see how far I had come 46.7 kilometers. After a felt eternity I looked again and was at 46.9. This was never going to end.


I drank some more, both water and tailwind, I ate a gel and took a bite of a snickers but everything just made me feel more nauseous. The thought of throwing up scared me a bit and I took some deep breaths, trying to stabilize my stomach and feel less weary. I don’t think anyone can really see these struggles that happen inside a runner. To everyone else I probably just looked bored as I was hiking down towards the finish line. But the spectrum of emotions and sensations during a 9 hour effort is just incredible. From anxious to calm, from ecstatic to wishing I had never signed up for this.

In the end I reached the finish line and I think it was all worth it. If it doesn’t scare you a bit and shows you your limits – is it really a challenge?",1538861747

Ultramarathon,RawhideRex,[Question X-Post] How can I support my partner during his Ultramarathon?,"[Xpost from r/running, who suggested I ask here too!]

My partner is running the Green Man Ultramarathon next weekend and I was wondering if I could get some advice from runners on how to support him or what it is you guys would like from support if running an ultra? It’s his first time going this far, and while I’ve supported him at half and full marathons, this is something quite different! We have been talking about what he might need, but because it’s his first ultra, he’s a bit uncertain/nervous. I’m not a runner, so I have no experience as to what long distance runners need or how I can help him :/ I was going to put together an ‘oh s**t kit’ full of spare kit, shoes, food, drink, tape etc, but again, any advice on what you’d want in an emergency kit would be awesome. Other than that, I was going to wait at each checkpoint to help him with whatever he needs. Is there anything post-race I can do to help his recovery?

Details: 45 miles/72 km, Elevation: 3100 feet/945metres, 4 checkpoints, cut off 12 hours. He’s optimistically aiming to finish in 9 hours, pessimistically 11.

Ultramarathon,FlaankEm,"Post Ultra - Rest, Recovery, Resume","Morning all. I'm post 100k and feeling 99% good. There's a nagging ache in my lower left leg that I'm sure will pass in time or if not I'll be heading off for an xray (stress fracture says the hypochondriac in me).  
Anyway I was thinking of taking two weeks off completely - no running at all, but maybe a casual bike ride with the kids and just the day to day stuff like walking the dog.  
After that I guess I just take it easy (running wise) for 2-4 weeks and see how I'm feeling? And after that I build back up to another event 12 weeks after that (if the event in mind fits that schedule).

Ultramarathon,slang4201,Listen to your body,"I thought I'd relate this, because, well, why not. I had planned a rather ambitious race plan for the spring, comprising of six 50K races in 12 weeks. Ambitious. Especially since I'm old. Anyway, things were going smoothly, until two weeks prior to the first race, when I rolled my ankle on a snow-covered rock, and limped/walked 5 miles out. X-Rays were negative, so I gritted and kept training. 

Fast forward to just prior to the first race-day and it's hurting. Big. I take up an offer for a cortisone shot to alleviate the pain for the race. The offeror is a doctor, and the one who took the X-Rays, so I agreed. That shit is magic. No pain, and I sailed through that race, and the next. By the time the third one was approaching, so was the pain. I made it through, though. Afterward, and prior to race number four, I asked for, and got one more shot. Doc explained that was the last, since there are diminishing returns on cortisone injections.

Once again, pain free for two races, and dicey for the third. After, I vowed to take it easy, and rest a lot. I didn't. I did my last longish run on the Fourth of July (11 miles) to Fourth of July Lake. It is a tradition I was loath to break, so I did it. Ow. I should have not gone.

I've since had an MRI, and it revealed I have torn, sprained, and strained ligaments. I am in a boot and cannot even walk flat surfaces without a reasonable Ow-factor. I definitely aggravated the strains and sprains by masking the pain and running. The tears are water under the bridge.

Your takeaway? Listen to your body. When it hurts, bag the race unless you want to pay the Piper later -- for you will indeed pay. Though I used the Cortisone and Go™ method to accomplish my goal, I can’t say I would recommend it for anyone, including future me.

Thanks for listening!

Alright so My son has been eating food for the past 2 months. We have those pouches to feed him when we’re on the go. He’s a baby so he spills a lot and I’ll wipe him up. Naturally I’ve tried the food that spills everywhere. It’s freaking delicious. I could go on and on about the flavors and the taste but I’m sure you all have long runs to get to soon. 
Today I had a 20 mile run. I also hate taking gels. I had the brilliant idea to substitute some gels for those pouches. It was so easy to get. Like taking candy from a baby.... so I have the pouch about 2 hours in and it was delicious. It had a full serving of vegetables about about 100 calories. The sugar content is lower than a gel but I didn’t have the stomach quakes I normally get. 
Am I crazy for thinking I can use these pouches as fuel for longer runs? Has anyone else tried this or am I truly a weirdo?

Anyone have thoughts on what it can be?  Or suggestions on what to do?

This is will be my one and only 50miler so I don’t want to screw it up. 

Thanks so very much for your help!",1536412126
Ultramarathon,running_rino,New shoe recommendation,"I folks. Struggling with which pair of shoes to go for.

Neutral running, prefer a good soft cushion, 50% pavement / 50% hard trails.  Probably used mostly in winter during wet conditions.
Milage 30m a week, with occasional ultra a few times a year (50m).

Currently using Brooks Ghost 11 but really need a dedicated trail runner as the Brooks is no good with slippy underfoot.

Ideally a decent value shoe, prepared to pay for quality, but the top of the line Salomons are pushing it a bit. 

I am torn between Brooks Caldera 2 and the Solomon Sense Ride. Nearly went for the Sense ride but I see the cushioning is not the greatest.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1536325235
Ultramarathon,runcan28,Question about sodium intake,"Hi all,
I have my first ultra marathon this weekend. My nutrition is pretty much dialed in and tested.
However, I am a little bit nervous about hydration and sodium intake. I usually just ''wing it''... I will be carrying enough water, so what I am nervous about is getting adequate sodium. I have salt tabs which I have tried, but I am scared of taking too many.
I plan on taking 2 GUs per hour, plus light salty food every 20 kms or so. Would you recommend taking salt tabs as well? If so, how often? My salt tabs contain 140 mg of sodium.
Also, what would happen if I were to take too much salt?

Ultramarathon,chad311,"I am doing the IMTUF 100-miler in a couple weeks, and I want to provide a way for my family to be able to track my progress -- what type of GPS will work wherever I am?"," 

I have the Garmin Fenix 5s, which I believe uses GPS satellites to track distance and speed and whatnot, but my understanding is that to share this location using the Garmin Connect app on my phone I will only be able to do so as long as I have cell phone service. Similarly, apps like Strava and Glympse -- as far as I know, but correct me if I'm wrong -- can only share the information you are sending others while your phone is getting a signal.

​

So my question is, what do I need that can allow my friends and family to check on my progress on the computer throughout the race, wherever I am (the race is in the mountains with limited cell service)? Thanks in advance!",1536080563

Ultramarathon,treefiveone,First ultra / seized knee,"I ran my first mini ultra last weekend. I say “mini” because it was only 46km but I say “ultra” because there was a mountain pass between the start and the finish. 

It went mostly good, but my knee seized up at about km 37! I could barely bend it!

The part I found to be most challenging was the terrain. My training runs are hilly but I can’t replicate the big rocks and technical terrain that I encountered at high mountain elevations. I blame the rocks for my knee seizing up. 

My question has two parts: 

1. What can I do to loosen up my knee if/when it seizes up? (I’ve never encountered this in training). 

2. How can I train to make sure that it doesn’t seize up again the next time I’m running in the mountains?

Ultramarathon,JGrayBkk,21.5 weeks enough to do a 100k?,"I started off this little running journey a few weeks ago, and I know the pitfalls of being too ambitious. So I'm here to ask you guys and gals. Is 21.5 weeks enough to train for a 100k?

If i can finish a 42k Trail on Nov 11th, do you think I can finish a 100k January 26th?

It is my understanding that you can have a coach that you never actually meet or train in person together but rather someone from afar that just sort of gives you a training plan and whatnot?  I am not totally sure how this all works but it does sound like it would be helpful.

At any rate, how would I find the right 'online'/'long-distance' coach, and what would be appropriate to pay for this type of coaching (taking into consideration that it is not as time-consuming as meeting and training in person)?

Ultramarathon,Russia84,Question on altitude - 4000meters above sea level &amp; altitude sickness?,"Hello all,

I'm about to participate in the Irbis race, which starts at 2500 meters, climbs to 4000 meters, down, then back to 3000, then down. I will sleep in the nearest city - Almaty - which is at about 700 meters, and travel to the start in the morning (1 hour drive). The run is about 50k.

Should I be worried about altitude sickness? My gamble is that the walk up should be fine, given that I haven't slept at high altitude. But I am far from certain.

3 Weeks ago I was at similar altitudes, then sleeping for a week at 2500 meters. I slept poorly for the first three nights, feeling as if Id had a bottle of wine before sleep and with fast heart beat.  After that I slept normally. I walked up to 3400 meters on the first day back then, without feeling any discomfort. Similarly, I had no problems during the race then - with max hight at about 3600 meters.

Ultramarathon,jnc23,Final training weekend coming up - how much volume? How far do I push it?,"I need some extra opinions here.

I'm heading into my final hard week before a three week taper. My first 100km race is 8 September. Over the last month I've been doing progressively longer back-to-back sessions on Saturday and Sunday. It's been going well and I'm feeling good.

This weekend I did 45km/27km. I'm fatigued but I'm not dreading another 120km+ week of training. Next weekend my plan calls for 40/30 and nothing on Monday. I'm considering upping that to 45/40, then 15km on Monday - 100km total over three consecutive days. I'll have then run 100km back to back and will know what it's like. OK, it's over three days not one, but psychologically I should be well prepared for the event. I'll then have three weeks to drop the volume and concentrate on recovery.

Is this a stupid idea? Or will I benefit from one last very hard weekend? I have no injuries, no foot issues etc. Just some built-up fatigue from this final training block.",1534081313

Now, a weak later of gentle swimming, jogging, foam rolling and stretching, I feel reasonably fine though still a bit sore.

I really - really- want to participate in a similar race two weeks from today (50km/3000m) - the Irbis marathon in Almaty, Kazakhstan. So, 2 questions:

1. Would this be considered to little recovery time for a person who is relatively new to trailrunning?
2. What would the ideal recovery strategy be before the second race? For now I'm thinking a week of relaxing, then a week of gentle running and strength training, then a week of relaxing again with only gentle runs.

Ultramarathon,bondom3417,Where to begin.,"Hi all, possible newbie here. Been running 15-20 years, but mostly cross country in HS then longer stuff after up to about 17-18 miles at around a 9:00 mile pace.

I'm hoping to keep that up as I can keep a solid pace with walk breaks pretty well and know that it'll obviously be slower on the trail but given some food and water I have the endurance for it.

Any advice on a jumping off point or am I pretty well on my way? Thanks for any advice, been getting a little stale at times training and looked like an exciting new idea!",1533689241
Ultramarathon,hicks185,My Burning River 100 Recap (first hundo),"This one is a bit long, but It covers 100 miles, so...  


Shortly  after running my first 50k last fall, I signed up for a 50 miler as a  winter getaway. Of course, I didn't even wait to experience that before  signing up for my first 100 miler: Burning River. At the time, I was  still living in Cleveland and could get to any section of the course  within a 40 minute drive, so I spent the winter running portions of the  course in the snow.  


Having about 3 months in Seattle to complete  my training made me much stronger on the hills and gave me practice on  more technical trails. I'm not sure how much better I am with technical  trails, given how much blood I've left out on those trails since  April...  


Race day had  nearly perfect weather. It rained  overnight and was very humid at the start, but it was only 65 in the  early hours and the high for the day was 75 with sun. I started out in  road shoes as the first 11 miles were on road with fairly easy trails  after that to the first drop bag at mile 21. There were 2 creek  crossings in there that required going ankle-deep, so a shoe change was  in order by that point anyway. I had a pacing plan for each major  section and was doing pretty well. I was very close for the first 11,  though I came into mile 21 10 minutes early after misreading the wrist  band I had my pacing strategy noted on. I used some of that extra time  for my shoe change and a bathroom break without feeling rushed.  


The  next 20 or so miles were pleasant, running through the woods and  sharing miles with other runners when our paces aligned. It was mile 45  where things turned. I was feeling good about my hydration and calorie  consumption, but I started getting nauseous and was having trouble  taking water. The gels, shot blocs, and sport beans I was carrying  suddenly all sounded awful. I had trained with these items up to 33  miles (and used them in my 50 miler), so I was in foreign territory  without any experience with fixing tummy issues. I was still about 10  min ahead though and figured I could take it easy into mile 50 with  hopes that I would feel better then.  


My pacing plan had me  finishing around 20 hours, 30 minutes (which was crazy ambitious for  hundo #1), but I came into the 50 mile station at 9h30m, having given up  my 10 min time bank. Unfortunately, I was still having trouble eating. I  took about 20 minutes to slowly try different food and rest. My mind  started to despair here, which was probably a mix of mental fatigue and  things not going well in a way I wasn't familiar with. Deep down, I knew  I was doing great and even still had a great shot at sub-24hr, but I  left the halfway point nearly in tears carrying a Ziploc baggie full of  pb&amp;j sandwiches that didn't really sound any better to eat than gels  at that point.  


The next 10 miles were a combination of walking  and jogging. This was especially brutal as it was a pretty flat portion  of the course where even a slow run would have been 4-5 min/mi faster (I  was averaging about 16:30/mi here I believe). I was still having  trouble drinking and this was the least shade I would have through the  middle of the day, compounding my issues. Somewhere in here I also  realized that, in my funk at the halfway point, I failed to re-apply  Vaseline and get some Tums to see if those might help me.  


Around  mile 55 the aid station was run by the Cleveland Triathlon Club and I  knew some folks volunteering. Their energy was a big mental boost and,  when I asked about Tums, a volunteer must have dumped half a bottle into  my pb&amp;j baggie. I would munch on those periodically for a while and  the helped a little.  


At the mile 60 aid station I was surprised  to run into a former coworker volunteering. We had a little chat, I got  some Vaseline to apply (it was too little too late), and this was the  first aid station with GRILLED FREAKING CHEESE!!! This was the first  real food I was able to take since mile 45 (over 4 hours ago). I managed  some pickle juice as well and went on my way.   


On my way to the  mile 66 aid station, I got a text that my first pacer, Sean, who had  planned to meet me at mile 72 had been following me online and saw I was  in trouble, so he drove out to pick me up 6 miles early. The Tums had  been helping a little bit, but I was still in rough shape. Knowing that I  would have a pacer soon helped me run a little bit more to mile 66 and I  had decided there was one last thing I hadn't tried to help my tummy. I  was going to move on to Coke and see if the cola would help.  


I  rolled into 66 a little bit stronger. I explained to Sean what I was  going through and what I had been eating. He suggested that I may have  been low on salt as the chewables I was using were much less potent than  caplets. I took more salt, had some grilled cheese, ramen, and coke  (the most calories in a long time!) and we headed out. It took a little  while, but I started feeling much better. Not great, and I was still  having trouble eating on the run, but it was the best I had felt in  quite a while. We ran more than I had been and I came into mile 72  feeling stronger.  


The coke and ramen had gone down best, so I  went back to those options again. The grilled cheese wasn't working for  me any more, so I doubled down on what was. I also had pickle juice and  green grapes. Over the next 4.5 mile section, I started to feel really  strong. I don't think I realized till later, but I believe the caffeine  in the Coke gave me a huge boost. Toward the end of this section, I even  ran down a relay runner. As good as I was feeling, Sean and I decided  maybe I was going a little too hard with 25 miles to go.  


I was a  little quicker through the mile 77 aid station. Coke, ramen, pickle  juice, grapes. This would pretty much be my go-to at every station from  here on out. It was also time to trade in my sunglasses and cap for my  headlamp. I also tossed a light wind breaker in my pack and grabbed a  Payday bar, which I had packed as a special, salty treat for later in  the race.  


The sun set between 77 and 82 and it got pretty chilly  outside of the woods. It was pretty surprising how much heat the woods  retain after sundown! I managed to eat half the Payday bar in this  stretch (very slowly) which was my first time taking calories between  stations in a long time (and the last, I think). I was also extra  motivated to get to the next station as the captain had promised me a  beer prior to the race. Chafing became a really big problem around this  time.   


As we rolled into the next stop, I put my wind breaker on  to keep myself warm, which helped a lot and stopped in the bathroom to  wedge some TP between my cheeks. It was a last-ditch effort to help the  chafing, but it worked perfectly! That problem was completely solved the  the rest of the run at least. At this station, I got coke, ramen,  pickle juice, a cold Coors Light, and tried grilled cheese again (nope).  The beer was a great moral boost going into a hilly 5 mile loop, but I  also knew this would be the last really hilly section and I had trained  on it a lot so I would know what to expect even when fatigued and in the  dark. After some prodding from my pacer we were off.  


Early in  the race, there were some relatively steep downhills on road that I  tried to take easy but ended up using a short choppy stride that I  wasn't used to. By mile 20, I had some discomfort in my right shin that I  thought felt like shin splints. It stayed with me all day, so I tried  to focus on good form without heel striking. By mile 82, it was starting  to really hurt. The hilly section between 82-87 really took it's toll  and I had to be really careful on downhills for the first time. I also  started to legitimately worry about serious injury. I had almost 20  miles to go and was in significant pain. I wasn't sure how it would hold  up (though I knew I was well-enough along that I could finish as long  as I could walk). With my increased pace since mile 66, I had a decent  shot at 23 hours, which Sean kept telling me to stop thinking about. All  in all though, my attitude was really positive at this point.  


The  station at 87 came and went. I had my routine down now: 4 small cups of  coke, ramen, pickle juice, some grapes, and go. This 5 mile section was  mostly road and then one good hill in the woods. The road was easier on  my shin, but just keeping my foot from dropping and dragging on the  ground really hurt now. As we entered the wooded section, we heard a  coyote. Sean remarked on how cool that was and then we heard another and  another and another... Suddenly, up the trail ahead, we heard maybe a  dozen coyotes howling... and then fighting. It sounded really vicious.  Sean and I were silent for a bit and I had visions of running into some  injured, pissed off coyotes on the trail. Luckily, that didn't happen,  though it was an unnerving 2 miles through that section of woods.  


Back  out on the road, I knew the next aid station was getting close. Now  walking hurt about as much as running with the shin pain, so I picked up  the pace. I was running people down that I hadn't seen since mile 60 or  before and leaving them in my tracks. At mile 92 I exchanged pacers (my  younger sister, Brittany, tagged in) as well as shoes (back to more  padded road shoes for the last \~10 miles). This was my only time sitting  down the entire race. I did my nutrition routine and we took off. I  definitely wasn't getting the hydration and calories I needed, but I  figured I could make it to the end. I needed to average 12/mi to finish  under 23 and we headed down the path at a 10/mi pace out of the aid  station.  


I still had nausea, but the shin pain was getting REALLY  bad. A wrong step here or there would result in me crying out in pain  and stopping in my tracks. It was even worse trying to get started again  after a short break. I was having to crouch down and bounce a little to  stretch out my hips, knees, and ankles and then start running as soon  as possible to avoid tightening up. I decided at this point that I  wouldn't be able to run for about 8 weeks, so I might as well make the  most of this race. I also wanted it to be over as soon as possible. We  hit mile 97 and had just 4.3 miles to go.   


There was one more  section of trail with some small hills and some stairs, but I could  taste the finish line already. My watch died around this time and  Brittany didn't have her distance/time worked out to know what we needed  to do to get in at 23 hours, so I was just going as hard as I could. We  hit a nice, smooth downhill on a road an I had to walk. The pain was  searing. I hobbled through the woods and had to use the hand rails to  get down the stair cases. When the path ahead flattened out for good, I  decided I needed to run the rest if at all possible. Each time I stopped  to walk, getting started again hurt more and more.   


We were then  out on road for the last 1.5 miles. Every step hurt so bad, whether it  was walking or running, so I told Brittany that I was going for the  finish as fast as I could. Pretty soon she couldn't keep up and  continued to cheer me on from behind. That last mile and a half felt  like a sub-8 pace. I was passing other runners on my way in and, when I  saw the finish, I was in a dead sprint, crossing the line at 22:50:02.   


I  was exhausted. I congratulated a few runners that crossed behind me and  then sunk into a chair. A volunteer brought me my buckle and Brittany  grabbed me a ginger ale. I'm not sure how long I sat there; maybe 20  minutes before I started to get cold and decided to head over to the  hotel. I got a hot bath, drank some water, ate a little something, and  tried to sleep. I was way too uncomfortable to sleep. My hips ached and  my shin burned, so I tossed and turned for about 4 hours. I decided to  get up and grab some breakfast before heading back to the finish for the  last hour before the cutoff. It was great to see 3 runners beat the  cutoff in the last 30 minutes and the runner that came in 15 minutes  after clearly wasn't worried about the official time, she had covered  101.3 miles under her own power and the joy in her accomplishment was  clear.  


It's been a week now and I can't believe how well I've  recovered! A physical therapist friend took a look at my shin later on  Sunday and suggested that I probably just had a strain of the tibialis  anterior (a much less serious injury than shin splints), which has  proven true as it feels almost 100% 8 days later. I ran 5 miles on  Tuesday (which was too much) and then 5 more on Thursday (still too much  but manageable). After 2 more days off I ran 20 on the Sunday following  my race and felt really strong. I'm excited that I'll be able to do  some more racing this summer and fall!",1533587781
Ultramarathon,runcan28,Can I do it? - 50 miler,"Hi all,

I am signed up to a 50 miler in September (Harricana). I am quite excited but it will be my first ultramarathon and I am nervous. I don't really know how my preparation compares to other runners. I feel that my mileage has been a little bit low and the long runs insufficient.

I am just looking for feelings based on your experience and the following stats/info - can I do it? If not, I can bump it down to the 65 km distance.

-50 miles, 2,200 m elevation gain.
-Beginning of fall temperatures, usually fairly sunny, and moderate temperatures (could get cold, but not worries about that - no chance of snow or ice).
-I average 65 kms per week. Minimum around 55 and maximum around 80. Pace between 4:45-5:30/km with some speed work but not much. Mostly on roads and light trails, some on serious trails.
-Long runs not as frequent as they should be. I do however go on long hikes with my girlfriend.
-I have run 3 marathons (2 last year and 1 this year) (3h32m) and 1 trail race (30 km with 1,500 m elevation gain, 3h).
-I plan on going slow, hoping to finish strong and happy instead of trying to make a specific time.
-Equipment, nutrition and hydration pretty much dialed in and tested.
-No foreseeable injuries.

Ultramarathon,agentxcell,"I have 9 weeks to get ready, including today. Linked is my training plan, feedback welcome.","So, I signed up for my first 50k. I was following a plan but ran into a problem with my longer runs.  I was having problems recovering on the longer runs so I made a plan with similar mileage to other 50k training plans with more moderate runs. I am hoping this will build the conditioning I need, with less recovery time needed. I heard a podcast recently about the merits of going at 70% most of the time and training everyday versus going to failure or just before and having to recover before training again. Any feedback is welcome as I am totally new to this. My background is that I was not much of a runner before this, I have been running about 15-25 miles a week up until this point and my long run was 10 miles. That one took me 2.5 days before I could run again. I am also super wary of injury so I am taking it slower than normal as an injury this close basically means I just have to cancel the race.

Ultramarathon,Hero_without_Powers,Short Ultra in three weeks after injury training pause,"In three weeks I have a rather short ultra scheduled, a 56k. usually this would not be a problem (I finished to 100k this year as well as one marathon), but eight weeks ago I ripped my right calf. Today I started running again, of course this hurt tremendously and I'm not even close to my usual level of running fitness. 

So how realistic is it for me to go for the ultra? I still have a very slight pain in my calf, but nothing that would stop me from training. Yet, I won't go for the race if the pain remains.

Also, to retain my fitness, i did a lot of race-biking in between, usually about 80k a day.

I have been rocking a Garmin Forerunner 305 for the last 10 years and love it, although feel I should invest in something a bit more modern and sleek for the next 10 years. The Garmin 735XT caught my eye as I have recently started an hr or two a week of open water sea swimming, and would like to increase my non existent pool swimming and maybe a 735XT will spark a bit of interest in pool swimming as the 305 did for running.

Would a 735XT be a good worthy upgrade? And should I bother with the HR strap? And finally, I use the Garmin footpod, is this redundant with the 735XT or still needed?

I run around 3-5 times a week, usually about 10 miles, but up to 20. Take part in marathons throughout the year and a few ultras.

In this hot weather I sweat a *lot* and hydration is becoming a challenge. I can easily drink fluid, it doesn't slosh around, but almost no matter how much I drink  i start to feel dehydrated. I'm also concerned about over-drinking. Last Saturday, I ran a 50k training run and drank 6 litres of fluid. I peed once. I drank another 4 litres of water and coconut water once I got home and only urinated once or twice (light straw/clear).
From a logistical point of view, refilling and carrying loads of water is a pain. Would this be considered an excessive amount of fluid? I'm not over-urinating but I was kinda shocked at just how much I drank. Am I condemned to just sweating more than other people?",1530707558

Ultramarathon,dhlwilson,"""He is justifiably regarded by many as one of the greatest ultra runners of modern times."" RIP Don Ritchie","Don Ritchie, the Stubborn Scotsman, passed away this weekend. 

I don't get the impression many folk will have heard of him but I thought I'd put a post up about him and encourage anyone that's interested to learn more about his running career. His training and results easily overshadows that of more recent stars of the sport, his guy was truly old-school in his training and racing. Within the more local Scottish running community many have talked recently of how modest and down to earth he was with youngsters having little appreciation of the true legend of the sport that was always down helping out at their track or XC sessions.

 *‘With track World Best Performances at 50 km (twice), 40 miles, 50 miles (twice), 100 km, 150 km, 100 miles and 200 km (twice), plus world road bests at 100 km and 100 miles he had an unparalleled record in the sub 24 hour events.’*

Ultramarathon,deve1oper,Questions about running form and running a marathon (and beyond),"Hi. This isn't specifically about ultras but I feel I identify better with the ultrarunning family and it's semi-on-topic. I've got a couple of questions, but I'll add more background first because I think it relevant.

I'm 43 and started running consistently in 2016 (20-40 km/week). In October last year I hurt the meniscus in my knee and had to stop running for several weeks. While not running, I looked at my last two years' worth of Strava profiles and there were three breaks in mileage lasting several weeks for both 2016 and 2017. All of those breaks were caused by injury, generally around the knee area but never exactly the same spot (below left knee, above left knee, left IT band, above right knee). 

Thinking this was telling me something, I asked a few people if they had any comments on my running form and they all said I had a very characteristic gait, but couldn't give me much more than that (they weren't runners themselves). I also remember finishing a 5k quite fast after a really slow start and seeing looks of concern on other runners' faces while I was sprinting home. I managed to find a couple of photographs and as I'd already been looking at my form, my conclusion was that I was heel-striking and over-striding really badly and my knees were sort-of squirming out to the side on impact. At this point, despite experimenting with barefoot-style shoes like New Balance Minimus and Merrell Trail Gloves, I was running nearly all the time in well cushioned shoes.

When I started running again in November 2018 I was committed to improving my form. I read/watched a lot and started with very short 2-3km runs in my Trail Gloves, focusing on shortening my stride to avoid heel-striking. I've increased my mileage gradually but it's taken a long, long time and I'm way behind where I was both speed-wise and distance. Before I could easily crack out a 30k, yet only last week I ran the most I've run with this 'better' form and ran a half-marathon (in 1.50) and my calves have been sore for four days now. In September 2017 I ran a 1.27 half-marathon, so my lack of pace is really beginning to frustrate me.

At the beginning of 2018 I said ""This is the year I don't get injured"". I believe the Trail Gloves are helping with that. Partly because every now and again I go out for a run in my Adidas and my IT band hurts the next day. But mainly because the Trail Gloves have such great feedback that I rarely overdo it (I overdid the last run but had to get back by a certain time otherwise I'd have stopped and walked). I think the cushioned shoes allow me to push harder than my legs can handle which is why I get injured in them. I absolutely love the feeling of running in the Trail Gloves when my legs are fully-rested, and feel they're better for me. I also experiment with true barefoot running for 1-2km per week as well.

Now, I'm wanting to run a marathon in October. And me being me, I want to run it in under 3 hours. If I switch back to the Adidas and trained and raced in them, I'm certain I'd do it, but only if I don't get injured. If instead I train/race in the Trail Gloves, then I'm not so sure, even though it will drastically reduce my chances of getting sidelined by injury. The training plan I want to use says you need to be able to run a sub-19 5k and I'm not sure I can (in the Trail Gloves, I definitely can in my Adidas). I'm going to try this weekend, but even if I make it I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the longer runs in Trail Gloves every week. But I really think I should prioritise not get injured this year and think longer term.

I've seen a consultant about my meniscus-injury and it's largely healed on it's own - I just have flexibility of the knee to work on. But the lack of heel-striking and the excellent feedback from the Trail Gloves has been a big factor in this getting better I feel.

My questions then:
1) Do people run ultras in non-cushioned shoes? If I'm being unrealistic thinking I'll ever run (trail) ultras in Trail Gloves (or similar), then I should probably switch back to cushioned shoes and find some other way to prevent injury.
2) Assuming I go ahead and try and run the marathon in the Trail Gloves, do you think I should do all of my training in the Trail Gloves (or similar)? Or would it be safe to mix in the cushioned shoes sometimes? There is such a pace/distance discrepancy at the moment that I'm unsure whether there'd be any point. My marathon pace would be 4.10 min/km which feels easy in the Adidas but a push in the Trail Gloves.
3) Will I ever be able to run as fast in my Trail Gloves, running with good form, as I could with my terrible running form before in cushioned shoes? It's been over six months now and I feel at least 30 seconds slower per km.
4) Shall I go for sub-3 or not? I think the answer is probably to train as hard as I can and listen to my body (which the Trail Gloves help with) but if anyone has similar experience with this quandary, please help!",1528965772

I've trained for longer distances, but I just don't have an urge to do races. I'm also a semi-seasoned hiker and go trail running as much as I can.

Ultramarathon,racequestion-,UPDATE: should i start a race I might DNF,"**TLDR: I did it! The ultrarunning community is amazing (here and IRL). Everyone was super friendly, helpful, and gave me pacing/nutrition advice and lots of encouragement.**

Hey all! So yesterday I did the race I posted about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/8mpwju/should_i_start_a_race_i_might_dnf/). This is absurdly long (don't feel obligated to read it all!). I can't thank this community enough!

I camped nearby Friday night and spent the entire night second guessing myself. Saturday morning check\-in was quick and easy. It was a very casual race (bib tear\-offs for timing, maybe 300\-400 people in total, \~100 doing the 50k). I felt a lot better seeing the range of ages and body types milling about \- there were definitely lots of sinewy runners in their 30's but also older people who i never would have guessed were runners. The weather was ok \- high of mid 80's (which is low for the area) with some brief periods of torrential downpour throughout the day.

I had a massive drop bag full of lots and lots of food (I've never eaten while running before and wasn't sure what i'd want... i had various bars/cut up fruit/candy/cookies/chips/etc), extra TP, a change of shoes/socks/clothes, SPF, bug spray, first aid kit, etc. Also obsessively packing and being over\-prepared calms my nerves lol. A dozen or so people had big plastic bins but it seemed the majority skipped the drop bag option and instead stopped at their cars (we ran past the parking lot about 14 mi in). The pre\-race email listed the aid stations (every 3\-5 mi) and what would be available (premuch everything i could imagine wanting: water, gatorade, sodas, chips, pickles, potatoes, fruit, various cookies, candy, wraps, bacon, gu's, etc). I carried two 8 oz bottles, a little baggy of cookies and dried cherries, a mini FA kit (safety pin, blister band\-aids, ibuprofen), TP, a tiny laminated map of the course, Nuun tablets, my ipod in a little baggy.

A couple minutes before the start, we all moved over to the starting line. I made sure I was in the back 1/3 of the pack. And then we were off! The first mile was a wide path, then it turned to single track. This made passing hard, but forced pacing which I appreciated. I tried to eat and drink as much as I could, stopping when I started to feel 'sloshy'. I probably averaged 2\-3 oz sports drink/soda a mile. After the group became more spread out, I'd pick someone to follow and stick with their pacing. I averaged around 10:45 min/mi for the first 15 miles (including stops for aid stations/bathroom). Around this point, I started following a man who was very friendly. We talked for a while and miles 15\-19 flew by. I was starting to not feel so great at this point. Physically, my hip flexors were pretty painful and mentally just knowing I had another 13\-14 miles left (yeah, the race was actually \~33\-34 miles on most people's watches). At this point, we were all totally soaked (which was fine, it was hot!) but the trails were slip\-n\-slides of mud, which made all the hills a little treacherous. The guy I was following was super encouraging. Explained his pacing strategies, gave me lots of advice on fueling, and talked a lot about his life/other races he'd done. Around mile 26, he stopped at the bathroom and I kept walking/jogging (thinking he'd catch up in a few minutes). He wasn't catching me, so I put on my ipod and tried to move as quickly as I could. I mostly alternated running \~9:30min/mi and walking 14 min/mi. Mostly walking, but I'm very comfortable walking fast, so I was still averaging 12\-12:30 min/mi.

All in all, going off my watch, I hit 50k at 6:08 and finished in 6:40!!!

I milled around the finish for a bit said thank you to the guy who I followed (I really would not have kept going without his pacing and encouragement). And then drove home. I stopped on the way for groceries (correctly assuming I would not be able to walk today lol). I had a pounding headache all night and currently feel like I've been hit by a bus. I've been far more sore muscle wise, but my hip flexors are wrecked and just my whole body hurts (especially my back \- it hurts to breathe!).

**Thank you so so much for all the encouragement.** I could not have possibly imagined it going as well as it did (my back of the mind stretch goal was sub 8 hr). I completely attribute that to the amazing community this sport has. A couple people definitely thought I was crazy (longest run 12mi, longest race before this was the 400m in high school) but they were super encouraging. Being able to walk quickly comfortably also helped \- i was moving fast enough during my walking breaks that I could take long breaks and still have okay splits. I'll need a couple weeks to forget but I have the feeling I'll be back for more races (with actual training this time).",1528646320

I have picked a local 24 hour race as my first attempt at an ultra because it is close, and will best mimic my training conditions.

As of now I am going to be working from a 50m training plan I found in the Krissy Moel ""Running your first ultra"" book.  My training will start in May and the race is in November 2019. My base will be around 30 miles a week before I start serious training.  It seems to me if I can just keep moving for the full 24 hours that I should push beyond 50 miles even.

I am fine with most of my runs, since they are typically 60 to 90 minutes and I have run without fueling on them before.  However, for my long Saturday runs (6+ hours), I plan on fueling as normal. 
 Will the change to eating/fueling on that one day cause stomach distress or undo the IF work I am doing?  Or, because it is only one day and because I am on the trail for so long, will it have minimal impact.

Obviously each person is different and I plan on figuring this out through trial and error.  However, I am curious about other peoples' experience if they have tried it.",1527608729
Ultramarathon,lessthanalot,x-post: first 100 miler in 6 months. Looking for advice.,"Hey everyone. Looking for some thoughts/advice/affirmation would also be great. 

Back in February, I signed up for my first 100 miler. It’s a flat, 5 loop course on October. Training started going well, but I’ve spent about the last month without running. Long story short, I was working a race and ended up running a bunch in shoes I should have and ended up with a tough shin splint. 

I’m all healed now, but unsure of what to do from here. I’m pretty stubbornly set on 100 miler (please call me an idiot because I know I am). I made similar big jumps to a longer when doing my first marathon and first Ironman and did so fairly successfully, both without overtraining. 

Now that I’m just 20 weeks out, I’m a bit nervous. I will preface this all by saying I’m in no way expecting to run it all or even large portions of it. I’m actually unopposed to hiking most of it. I’m more searching for the mental challenge in it all. But, what would you suggest is best course of action? Like what should I ramp up to? I’ve done plenty of reading about working up to 30m-20m runs on a Saturday/Sunday or something. I also don’t want to work myself up that fast and get hurt or anything. Can’t really afford another injury at this point. Anyone have experience with minimal training or any pointers? Thanks in advance everyone!",1527551676

Ultramarathon,avidhobbyjogger,Still beat up from marathon 2.5 weeks ago with my first 50k in two months - looking for advice from some veteran ultrarunners,"Hey everyone. Thanks in advance for your help. I really hope that I can get back to normal soon - running is a massive part of my identity and I'm feeling lost without it.

I raced a marathon 2.5 weeks ago on April 29. I maxed out my training at 50mpw and I hit my 4 hour goal (3:56:44), but I apparently tore my body up pretty good.

Basically, I've run a total of just 14 miles these past 2.5 weeks in 4 runs (consisting of 6 miles, 2 miles, 5 miles, 1 mile). Today, I tried to run again and I did one mile until I realized the pain was only going to get worse. It took me 10:30 to run that mile and my legs were *killing* me. 

I know I need more recovery time, or else suffer potentially months of injury. How much more time can I reasonably take off from running before a trail 50k on July 14 is impossible? My goal is to have fun and finish - I'm not going to bother with any time goals in such a short period of time. 

Also - should I abstain from bike commuting? I have a 3.5 mile route to work, but I'd rather get up early to take the bus than sabotage my recovery!

Thank you so much for reading and any advice you can provide.",1526514427
Ultramarathon,porcupine94,Mixed Athlete Getting started!,"I am 23 years old and I have been working out for the past 4 years.

Ultramarathon,minkypoo,Everything hurts and I’m dying... (recovery from walking pneumonia).,"Hi everyone! I’m new to ultras and am supposed to run my first 50K in three and a half weeks. At the end of March I ran my farthest distance of 22 miles. I felt great, totally fine to continue with training. Then about ten days later I got sick with some sort of virus that turned into walking pneumonia.

Needless to say, I barely ran for the whole month of April, but when I did, it was likely too early in my recovery and I was slow, weak, easily winded.

Now here we are in the middle of May and I have barely made any progress. I feel like I’ve started all over again. I can hardly make it more than two miles at a time without stopping to walk and my longest distance to date is only 8 miles! And I’m consistently running 1:30 slower per mile.

I really don’t think I have enough time, or energy to continue training for this race - much less run it. My husband thinks this is primarily a mental block, and I’ll admit that’s part of the problem, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

However, after running the LA marathon in mid March this year, I’ve been in a total slump. I took a two week break from running after LA, then ran for 2 weeks. Now I’ve taken 3 weeks completely off again as I have zero motivation to run. However, I am feeling an urge to get running again and get into my training plans.

Problem is, I have no idea where to start. I am only 23 weeks away from the race and I have never ran more then 42.2 km. This race is gonna be hills galore in the first half, then all downhill after 50 km. I purchased a 50 k training plan and 100 k training plan from sage running however these both add up to 32 weeks. How the hell can train for this race with only 23 weeks until? Do I jump to week 9 in the 50 k plan right away? I assume that would injure me as the long run would be 26-29 km at that week.

Ultramarathon,statedroopers,Running first “ultra” 30 hour race at the end of June. Looking for advice on race day strategy.," A little background, I’ve been putting in consistent miles since March, haven’t ran more than 15 miles in one sitting and average about 35 miles on a good week but I also mix in a good amount of strength training, prehab( glute bridges, hip flexor stretching, abduction adduction), and yoga. I grew up wrestling and have been running pretty consistently since I was 13, I’m now 28. I ran a marathon about 8 years ago and I feel like I’m in better over all shape now then I was then. The course I’m running is 5 mile loops on relatively flat trails, my plan is as follows: run 10 miles at no faster or slower than a 12 min mile pace, take an hour break to rehydrate, eat, take in salt and do any mobility or stretching that is necessary. If I repeat that for 29 hours than I can complete 100 miles, but of course I don’t see everything going perfectly and I figure this plan also gives me space to adjust and adapt to whatever goes wrong on race day. I won’t lie I have a healthy amount of anxiety about this race, my main concern is getting some type of stress fracture. So I’m curious to see what you guys and gals think of my race day plan. Am I taking to many long breaks? Will this stop and go strategy end up confusing my body and cause me an injury? Or is this a good conservative plan to complete 100 miles in 30 hours?

Ultramarathon,daydreamurr,On Sunday 4/22/2018 I ran 41.83 miles,"With the help of my wife and sister acting as a mobile aid station I was able to run the distance of 41.83 miles from my home just outside Pasadena to my hometown in the Inland Empire in 5 seconds short of 8 hours. Official finishing time 7:59:55. The day after I was pretty sore as one could imagine but amazingly not fully incapacitated. This run wouldn’t have been possible without the army of friends, family, and yes, even the doubters who said I was nuts to take on such a run, to motivate me. The run had varried terrain surface which in my opinion made it easier on my knees to run almost 20 miles of the second half on gravel/dirt and not just concrete and asphalt. The California sun also could’ve been hotter which I’m grateful was not. I’m lucky to have never hit a wall or any low points out there. After mile 30 my mind was more focused on closing the gap on the finish than any physical discomfort I may have been experiencing.

Ultramarathon,mjvargodvm,Training plan recommendations for improving 50 mile race?,"Hi guys!  So last year I made my first foray into ultra-running after several years of marathoning.  I ran a pretty successful 50k and a “successful on paper” 46mile race using the 50mile/week plan from Relentless Forward Progress.  I say it that way because while I am super impressed with my finish time (8:45ish) and placing (3rd place female),  I felt terrible for at least 10-15miles of it from mostly GI upset but probably suboptimal training as well.  I have since completed the advanced marathoning 17/55 plan and qualified for Boston 2019 in early March.

Looking at the Relentless Forward Progress plans again, it seems mostly easier than the Advanced Marathoning plan with just longer long runs.  I am considering making my own by combining the two, but now I’m making it overly complicated.  I already know that I can finish the race, now just looking for ways to make it a better experience.

Ultramarathon,wishgrantedyo,Just another new guy looking for some advice on trail running,"Hullo all!

I'm running a 50k in September! Very excited. My goal is to finish, stretch goal to finish sub-6. It'll be a pretty hilly trail run.

Some background:

I'm a 26 year old guy, pretty good shape. I'm no running god by any stretch but you know, I'm athletic. I love running, but I've never been a racer. I can run 16 miles pretty well at a 8:20 pace or so, and I've hit 18 miles at 8:30. I've never run a marathon and I want to skip straight to 50k, mostly because I can and I think it would be cool. To prove a point to nobody but myself, I suppose.

I've only ever run on roads (hilly ones to be sure), but this is trail, which I understand to be wildly different.

Some specific questions I have:

1.	Do I need specific trail shoes? Some runners I idolize use hoka one ones, so I might try for those if so. I use a pair of new balance and a pair of nikes right now. Road shoes.
2.	Trail hills. Steep, is my understanding. More real than road hills. I know that one way to prep is to run more hills... do you think I ought to work in some additional leg workouts to pump up my climbing muscles? Weights? Anything like that?
3.	Carrying my own food and water. What do y'all recommend? I see a lot of folks using vests. And, types of foods... If possible I want to avoid gels, just kind of on principle I like the idea of ""real food"". Do you think gels are worth it for these bigger distances though? I've never actually tried them.
4.	What is something that you wish you knew for your first trail race?

And, non-specifically, anything else, of course. Most important training aspects, etc.

### Training
I'd been looking forward to this race for a while - the simplicity of track ultras is something appeals to me, much as I enjoy all sorts of racing from fells to roads I like that on a track there's literally nothing to focus on but the running. 

That said, I'd done no specific training for this one as it wasn't an A race but I absolutely wanted to do well in this one and felt that after finally [http://runjames.co.uk/races/unexpected-pb-dewsbury-10k-2018/](breaking the sub 35 barrier at Dewsbury 10k) recently on the back of some consistent 70 mile weeks I'd have enough in my legs to have a solid run and last the distance at a decent pace.

### Pre-race
The race is in Wales near Cardiff so I had to drive 4.5 hours down the night before and get a hotel near the track and to be honest it was all pretty uneventful which is nice. 

I bought my usual pre-race dinner of a margarita pizza (2 this time!) and basically just chilled in the hotel room before managing to actually get a good night sleep which is very unusual. Unlike usual I actually bought a 2L bottle of water and drank most of it in the evening as I tend to not take on that much during a race so I figured a bit of pre-hydration wouldn't hurt. 

In the morning, a simple cup of coffee and one of those just-add-water porridge pots before showering and heading to register. 

### Race
Barry 40 is a small but iconic race and over the years some sensational athletes have taken part and it's one of the reasons I wanted to run because sometimes it's nice to share a track with runners who you'd never see in a normal race as they'd be so far out of sight. 

This year saw Steve Way, Nathan Flear and Tracy Dean start the race - all have run at international level in ultra distance so my initial target of a podium spot already looked *ahem* optimistic. Add to that, Steve Speirs, Paul Ali and Tim Rainey who are all very experienced ultra runners it was going to be a small but high quality field for sure. 

After meeting my lap counter and sticking my bag with a couple of gels and a change of shoes/shirt by the track we were ready to go. 

My aim for the race was to run 7:15/mile pace through to 30 miles which I've done before and then essentially see if I could hold on to the end which would be the 4:45 goal but right from the start my Suunto was showing how wildly inaccurate it can be sometimes and reporting a mid 5 minute mile pace for the first couple of laps so I took it off and ran by feel from then on which was a little tricky but I settled into a pretty comfortable pace ticking off laps just around the 1:50 mark. 

Although the pace was a tiny bit off my original goal, there was a reasonable wind blowing across the top corner of the track which would definitely add to the effort over the course of the race so I just figured without my watch anyway I'd just run to feel and work out my pace on the fly when I hit various milestones through the race. 

The first 10 miles fly by pretty quickly - to be honest I was a bit starstruck seeing Steve Way do his thing, he went through 10 miles in 60 minutes flat and honestly was just cruising so easy at that pace it was a joy to watch even as he went past me once a mile for the next 4 hours (until he won in 4:13). 

The next goal was to get to 20 miles feeling comfortable and somewhere around 2:25 to be on pace but the wind was starting to just help my legs feel a little tired and I went through in 2:28 so about 10s a mile off goal pace but to be honest I wasn't too bothered at this point. 

I'd started the race in my Adidas Takumi Sen flats which had been fine to 20 miles but my feet were starting to feel a bit delicate so I swapped to my Hoka Tracer 2 for the remainder of the race at this point and just kept focused on ticking off lap after lap - 161 laps is lot but half done now. 

The marathon distance came in 3:16:59 which I was reasonably happy with, not too far off what I planned on but the legs were definitely beginning to fatigue and although I kept ticking off laps in the 1:5x's I was definitely hurting and knew it was going to be a hard fought half marathon remaining. 

#### Hurting now

At some point around 30 miles I briefly jumped into 3rd place but it was short lived (about a lap!) as Steve Speirs closed me down and went past as I was tiring and he just looked to be getting stronger and stronger. Ultimately he gapped me by 20 minutes in the last 10 miles. 

35 miles came around with a bit of light rain but not enough to really bother changing or putting on a jacket - it wasn't too cold - but my legs were shot at this point. I did wonder how I'd fare without specific training doing runs beyond the 3 hour mark and the answer was that it hurts and you go pretty slow. 

My laps beyond 32 miles were into the low 2:0x mark and my stops at the food table at the end of the finishing straight were just a few seconds longer each time as I took on small amounts of water and some coke + gel but I made the effort to either be properly running or stopped for a few seconds rather than walk. Not for any specific reason, just figured it would hurt a little less to keep my stride consistent as racing long distance on a track is so repetitive the fatigue is sometimes more localised than trail racing or even roads. 

#### Finishing

My lap counter who'd been supremely encouraging and helpful all morning gave me a couple of countdowns now as he could see I was suffering and so it was great to hear ""only 20 laps"" and then ""only 16"" followed by ""just 10 more"" at which point I felt some relief that the race was reaching the last couple of miles and then I'd be able to sit down and have a brew.. 

I was in 4th and although at this point was half an hour over my goal time (which was perhaps a bit optimistic) I felt I'd had a strong enough run and although I tired from 30-35 miles then really had to hang on from 35 to the finish it wasn't too bad a day out and my 5:17:20 finishing time equated to 7:55/mile pace for 40 miles. 

If I look back to where I was even a couple of years ago running under 8 minute miles for that amount of time would have been unimaginable so I was ultimately happy with that and but for the wind and realistically a lack of specific training regarding long runs for time on feet I could certainly do better next time. 4:45 better? Maybe. Sub 5? I'm sure that's possible. 

Ultimately I finished 4th behind a truly world class ultra runner, a Welsh international champion and a guy with a 15 hour 100 mile PR and ahead of a lady who's represented England all the way up to 24 hours so can't complain! 

### Post-race
This was my second track ultra following last year's 24 hour race and once again, the purity of the running challenge combined with sharing the track creates a really wonderful running experience and I'd absolutely continue to do track ultras in future and recommend them to anyone who wants to try something different. 

When else do you get to just run for hours on end and share the same space as such an amazing variety of athletes? 

I didn't have time to hang around unfortunately as I had to drive back home right after the race and I felt I'd be better off having a shower and heading off before my legs stiffened up too much and I wanted to allow for more rest stops on the way home so the 4.5 hour drive down was more like 7 when I added breaks and the truly dire weather and roadworks. 

I'll definitely be back to Barry again in the future, it's a classic ultra that deserves support and the organisation, friends and volunteers who give their time really made it a great day out.

Ultramarathon,big-brown-bear,"Problems with blisters in ""normal"" running shoes","Hey guys, 
i got an important question. Have been running for more than four years. Completely barefoot or in minimalist shoes. Did more than 10.000 km the last three years. Feel great, no problems at all. No blisters, no pain, lots of fun. I average about 50-80km per Week.
I mostly use Xero shoes or vivobarefoot.

Now that i ease into ultras (100k, 50k) I am starting to have a problem: For these extremly long and exhausting runs (sometimes very tecnical to run too) I feel my running form fall apart.
Which is in my opinion not very unlikely at 4am, awake for 24 hours, very tired.

So I decided to get some more ""normal"" running shoes with a little bit of cushioning, mainly to give my heels a rest, because you also walk a lot in these long runs. I do not have any pain using normal running shoes, even though I feel that I run a little different in them.
I tried several different shoes (No Name, Altra Lone Peak, Salomon XA Pro 3d, Salomon Sense SLab Sense 6).

All these shoes are great running shoes, but I will always get blisters in them. The funny thing: No matter what shoes, the blister will always be on the same spots:

[Picture with marks where the blisters occur](https://imgur.com/a/ATRoi)
Meant is the spot, where the skin of my foot will not touch the ground anymore. My feet can take a lot of beating, but the skin at the inner side of my foot is very thin.

I am starting to think, that this is because of the cushioning of the shoes. I ""sink in"" and get friction on the skin, which usually does not touch the shoe.


So did anyone experience the same issues? What did help? Are there shoes which have cushioning in the back but not the front?
Just one more thing: My choice of shoes is limited, because of my very wide and high feet (mainly from running barefoot) which means, that most normal running shoes are to narrow for me.

Any help greatly appreciated.",1519748905
Ultramarathon,bear_beer_beard,First 100 in November - road tripping Sept until race week,"Hey all,

Occasional poster, first time OP.  

TL;DR - I'm running the Chimera 100 in southern California (22000' gain/loss) in November.  I have a pacer lined up for the last 52 miles but the race claims to be stingy on allowing pacers (for ""distance virgins"" only).  I will be on the road from early Sept until ~10 days before the 100 basically running and climbing mountains every day.  Anything in particular to focus on?

A little more info - I'm on a quest to summit every state high point, so before moving away from the east coast and heading west, I'm going to spend a month in the NE area (Sept) + a month in the mid-Atlantic/south (Oct) hitting peaks and tackling some of the ""classic"" trail runs on this side of the country.  

The current training plan calls for about 50-80mpw/5-20k vert with a blend of running and hiking for those two months.  Longest days will be 25-30mi (4-7hr).  

I have two ultras planned this summer - Many on the Genny (40mi) in June and the Catoctin 50k in July.  I may be shooting for a win in July if I'm near the lead halfway through (based on previous years' winners, I have a very strong shot at it).

Chimera is run on groomed single-track + fire roads and I'm very familiar with the course having run/hiked most of it many times.  Climbs are long and only moderately steep (6-12%), but I imagine I'll still be walking all of them.

Is there anything in particular I should be focused on that I might not consider during this trip that will help prep me for the 100?

I'm probably going to choose between the Waldo 100k or Pine to Palm 100m, both relatively near where I live in Oregon. I volunteered at Waldo last year, so I can skip the lottery if I do that.

I've done a bunch of 50ks and one 50 miler so far. I kinda liked the idea of Mountain Lakes' relatively mild elevation profile. Both of my new options are more brutal in that respect.

Ultramarathon,coldhearted801,Hey guys I just found this sub!,"First off cool to be here! Now into the gist of things. A friend of mine and I were talking strategies in how we prep for ultras, and the topic changed to nutrition especially what and how much we eat the days before a race. When I said I like to intake as much protein, carbs, glutamine, and potassium and calories in general before a race he didn’t seem to think that my strategy of a lot of glutamine and potassium was a good idea. I explained that I had no scientific evidence to back this up just that I have been doing it and it seems to combat a lot of cramping.

He also thinks that the amount of calories I consume is too high but he’s more a runner with low muscle mass, where I have muscle mass and lift a lot, I consume way more calories to try to not lose muscle mass or weight. 

So in conclusion he thinks that me consuming well over 5000 calories the days before a race is foolish and also consuming a lot of glutamine and potassium is no use. Am I just crazy or does he have a point? 

I’ve been doing this for years and it seems to have a great effect in me and how well I run. I also won’t sacrifice my high calorie intake because I’d rather be built and strong as it seems to help me keep from injuring my knees, ankles, and back.

The farthest I've ever run was 25k on trail. I've never even run a marathon distance on road. As far as races go, I've done two road half marathons and three trail races, the longest being 16k with about 1200ft elevation gain.

I have one day a week I can devote longer than two hours of training to, and I have three of those days before registration day. I've heard that two consecutive days of long runs are good for training. While I can alter my life to make that happen closer to the race, I'm not able to do that now.

I guess my question is, what can I do over the next three weeks to get me feeling like I'm not a complete fool for even considering this race? I don't care about time, but I don't want to get a DNF. The cut off is 12hours. I ran 20k on Saturday about half road and half hilly trail, nothing crazy as far as elevation gain.

###I will eat you, and you will not come back up.

It was hot and exposed. Highs on race day were predicted to be around 80, but were actually 86. Large sections of the course had little to no shade. And I am not a good with heat. Combine those things, and you have me, slightly delirious, talking to my gel packet at mile 34 of last Saturday’s San Diego 50. “I will eat you, and you will not come back up,” I said, as if that was going to make a difference. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and I was stupidly behind on calories, nauseous, and (needless to say) a bit discombobulated. Freeze frame, record scratch. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.

I have rather poor impulse control regarding running. If I see a race, trail, or group run that looks interesting, I usually convince myself that it’s a good idea. Which is exactly what happened for the San Diego 50. I was in the recovery doldrums following a very successful (and fun) High Desert 50k when a friend of mine mentioned that the SD 50 is a fun event, and a good setup for a first 50 miler. And, coming 6 weeks after the High Desert and 6 weeks before the Birkie, the timing is perfect. So, I tweaked my training a bit and signed up!

As it turns out, 50 miles is quite a bit further than 31. And I didn’t quite have the base to really try to race the whole thing (my longest weekend was back-to-back long runs totaling 37 miles). So, I planned to run the first 30 miles conservatively, then make a decision as to how to treat the final 20. As race day approached, forecasts suggested we’d see some hot weather. So I adjusted my plan slightly, thinking that I could push a tiny bit harder for the first two hours, putting some miles down (and banking some time) before the heat became too oppressive.

I also put together a fantastic crew! Hats off to my friends Natasha and Shivi. Despite not being ultrarunners (or knowing much about the sport), they took great care of me through a pretty tough day.

###The Race


There’s not a ton to say about the early race. I focused on getting into a comfortable rhythm, remembering landmarks for the way back, and staying ahead on calories/liquids. I also wanted to bank a bit of time for the later part of the race, knowing that I was going to suffer in the heat. Over the first 10 miles, I did this well. I may have moved a bit faster than was strictly wise, but sometimes you just have to take advantage of feeling good. The early morning was also beautiful, and I was enjoying watching the sun beginning to peek out over the hills.

I came into the first crewed aid station, Sunset 1, and looked for my crew. I was craving potatoes, and I wanted to restock with some pancakes for the next section. But… they had missed me! I was running a few minutes ahead of schedule. The runner right in front of me was in a similar situation, and we both hurriedly asked a volunteer to keep an eye out for our respective crews and send them along to the next stop.

…And this is where things began going wrong. I just didn’t know it yet. As we progressed out of Sunset, we did a bit of climbing and got onto the shore of Lake Hodges. We also entered 10 miles of trail with approximately 800 meters total of shade. The whole thing was exposed, and the day was beginning to heat up. Moving along, I was feeling good and ended up passing a few runners. Which got the competitive juices flowing. I remember looking at my watch at a couple of points along here and seeing my HR creep above 160 (Bad for this point in the race!). And if we’re being honest, my subjective effort was higher than it should have been. But I was still cranking off the miles, in a good rhythm, and eating well. And those are the important things, right?

After breezing past Del Dios (the 15-mile aid station) and seeing my crew (!), I headed out for the second half of the Lake. The second half was a lot like the first half. It was already warm and getting hotter, I was still moving along well (and a bit faster than I should have), and eating and drinking (but maybe a bit less than before). And then I make it to Bing Crosby, at mile 20. By then, it was 10:40 (real time), and I was feeling the heat. My stomach had begun feeling a bit funky, but that’s not strange for me around this point in a race. More worryingly, my legs were feeling increasingly fatigued. But I kept ignoring the increasingly loud warning signs, and headed towards the turnaround with high hopes.

###Halfway There…

If you can’t tell, there was a period of time where my body and mind were in a very different place. My mind was eager and competitive, wanting to keep pushing and start passing people! My body was hanging on. I didn’t feel terrible, but the heat was taking a real toll, and I was slowly getting more behind on calories.

The miles between Bing Crosby 1 and 2 (out and back to the turnaround) are hot, hilly, and exposed. Do you sense a pattern yet? These miles also contain the switchbacks that I had read about. Yes, they are just as annoying as people say. The hill isn’t really that steep, and the trail could totally have cut straight up the hill.

At the top of the switchbacks, there was a volunteer trying to direct us. As I passed, she looked at me and said something. I either didn’t hear her, or was too much in my own head to pay attention. But, she pointed down a hill, so I ran down the hill. At the bottom, there was a volunteer parked at a closed gate, with trail markers extending past his car. He turned me around, explaining that they had to cut the race short because of a permitting issue with the County. At the time I was disappointed. Looking back, that was probably for the best…

Those of you who are reading this who have gone through something similar are probably chuckling to yourselves right now. You see what is coming. A massive blow-up. And don’t worry, that is exactly what happened. (Spoiler alert!). I came back into Bing Crosby 2, I gave up on eating real food, and resigned myself to 20 miles of choking down gels and blocks through nausea. I didn’t resign myself to a lot of climbing. Although none of it was particularly steep, the next 2 miles were almost entirely uphill, and completely lacking in shade. They were also where my mental state took a nose-dive.
 
By the end of the climbing, we were back at the lake and I was suffering. Another runner had passed me (by running uphill!), but he wasn’t moving that much faster. So I focused on keeping him in sight while negotiating a truce with my legs. The deal was that if they agreed to let me run anything that was downhill or flat, I would agree to walk anything that could even remotely be considered uphill. Through this method, the race shrunk. It was no longer about running the 17+ miles to the finish. It couldn’t be, that seemed impossible. Instead, it was about the 100 meters immediately ahead of me, and whether I would be walking or forced to run.

When I got to Del Dios 2, I think my crew could sense that I wasn’t exactly doing great. It may have had something to do with how I stumbled in, asking for a chair and a bucket of ice water. Having a crew is not important when things are going well. Yes, they can transport your gear and give a nice cheer at aid stations. But you don’t really need that. When things go poorly however, a good crew is worth their weight in gold. As I was trying desperately to cool off (and really enjoying the shade under a tent), Natasha and Shivi fed me iced ginger ale, and tried to force as many calories into my body as possible. The calories and cooling were nice, but more important was the timely reminder that I was doing really well, and could continue to do so. Also, shout out to the awesome trail crashers volunteers! With my crew a bit taken aback by my poor state, one woman hopped in, gave me one hell of a pep talk, iced me down, and had me back out on the trail faster than I would have liked.

As they sent me off, I requested iced Red Bull, and salted gummy Life Savers. That request felt quite reasonable to me at the time, but caused quite a bit of confusion for my crew. Apparently salted fruity candy isn’t something that a normal person craves. But with my quads on the edge of cramping, you gotta do what you gotta do.

Running out of Del Dios, my deal was still in effect. Relentless forward progress became the goal, the mantra, and pretty much the only thing that I could manage. I knew I was going to finish, but I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty. I was also realizing how far behind I had gotten on fuel. From miles 28-34, I probably took in about 100 calories. That’s not enough. And so I found myself, running along the path above Lake Hodges, taking to my gel. “I will eat you, and you will not come back up.” It didn’t look convinced. Neither was I. But I choked it down. And it worked! Hats off to Honey Stinger for making gels that I can get down, even when nothing else seems to work. I’m fairly confident that any other food would have make me puke at that moment.
 
The Honey Stinger did the trick. It kept me moving towards Sunset 2, my last chance to see my crew. About half mile from the aid station, I got passed. It sucked. I hate getting passed, especially in the second half of a race. But getting passed also snapped me out of my funk, in a strange way. At this point, I was in the process of mentally giving up. I had banked enough time that I would finish, even if I walked the rest of the way. And with my legs and stomach feeling terrible, walking it in was starting to look a little more appealing. Also, I knew everyone else was hurting, and I was deluding myself into thinking that I could hold my place with a really slow finish. Then boom. He runs past me, says a few encouraging words, and is gone. Admittedly, I was in a bit of a fog. It took me a bit to process what had happened, but I decided that I wasn’t going to spend the rest of the race letting more people do that. 8 miles after my low point started, it began to lift.

Determination is one thing. Physical capability is another. Getting passed was the first step in building that determination, and seeing my crew was the second. They had my iced Red Bull, my salty gummies, and lots and lots of ice. They also had some encouragement, and sent me onto the last leg with every single caffeinated Honey Stinger that I had brought. Between the Red Bull and a Honey Stinger every 25 minutes, I figured that I could keep enough sugar and caffeine coming in to allow me to move forward.

I also set incremental goals. The first goal was to make it to Raptor Ridge. 4.3 miles of flat ground stood in the way, meaning that I’d have to run (my deal was still in effect). The next goal was to make it to the top of the ridge. Next, I’d run down the other side. That was it. From there, I’d almost be able to see the finish.

The miles between Sunset 2 and Raptor Ridge 2 were a bit of a blur. Everything hurt, but at that point in a race relativity is everything. And I hurt less than before. I focused on moving and eating. And all of a sudden, I could see the ridge ahead of me, but not the aid station. The last mile to the base of the ridge did not end. At every turn I was desperately hoping to see a tent. I needed ice, and I was very ready to be on to my next goal, getting up the ridge. Finally, it came into view. Amazingly, some of my SURF friends had made the trek out. Their friendly faces (and ice) sent me away ready to keep moving.

Just as I entered the aid station, someone was leaving. That someone happened to be the guy who had passed me 5 miles earlier. As I began climbing I was able to see him above me, providing that extra spark of motivation to keep moving.

There’s not much to say about the end of the race. I hurt, I was ready to be done, and I was chasing my new friend. So I leaned into the pain, ran everything I could, and finished the damn race. Coming up to the line, moving as fast as I could, I heard one of my crew shout “Joe, sprint!” I responded with “I am sprinting!” while moving at a pace that could only generously be called a run. But you gotta do what you gotta do.
 
After the race, all I wanted to do was sit in the shade and take advantage of not having to move. My legs were twinging, I still thought that I might puke, and I was dead tired. Fortunately, I had my crew. They wouldn’t take no for an answer, fetching me ice, ginger ale, water, and even forcing me to eat some chili!


###Post-Race

Immediately after the race, I was pretty disappointed. I knew that I had bonked really hard, and failed to meet many of my goals and expectations. In the days since, I have gained a bit of perspective. Yes, I was a bit of an idiot. But I learned a ton! Next time, I will be more prepared for heat, take in more consistent calories, and be more proactive when I feel terrible. As for this time, I think I’m satisfied. I know that I left time out on the trail. But I didn’t leave any effort out there. In the end, that’s all I can hope for.

Huge thank you to my crew, Natasha and Shivi! The race was one hell of a mental battle, and having them waiting for me was a great boost. Thanks also to all of the amazing volunteers, especially the woman who pumped me up at Del Dios 2 and Scotty Mills who was a friendly face that I needed to see at Raptor Ridge 2.

Ultramarathon,yostietoastie,"Thinking about a double marathon, have some questions","So I am doing a 50k in April and there’s a double marathon a month later that I am thinking about doing. I’ve done multiple marathons but the 50k will be my first ultra. Since most plans I see for 50 milers have the longest run around 30 miles I figured hey why not just keep on chuggin. So here are some questions I have:

Is a month enough time after my first 50k to recover for the 50 miler? The 50k is a trail run but it’s a completely flat course, so I’ll have to do more training on tougher terrain but I think the 50k will be a good training run for the double without too much risk of injury

Kind of in conjunction with the first question, am I doing too many miles too fast? My SO got an overtraining injury a year ago that he is still recovering from, so he’s super nervous that I’m doing too much distance too fast. I started training for a February marathon in October and I’ve been doing long runs on Sunday and running half the distance of my long run the day before to get extra mileage in and to get used to running on tired legs. Will this be enough or am I pushing too hard? Should i wait till next season to try for the double?

What’s the biggest difference in strategy between the 50k and 50m? Any tips for a newbie? I read that having sturdier shoes like Hokas can make a big difference with tired feet. 

Ultimately I’m just worried about overtraining and getting an injury. I listen to my body and take extra days off if I really need it but I just want to make sure I’m giving myself enough time to train for these races or if I should just wait till next season (because I’m a baby and don’t like to train hard throughout the Texas summer) especially since I’ve never run these distances before. 

Thanks!

Ultramarathon,morflegober,Doing just One long run per week,"I know it would be optimal in my case to run more often (my base build at this point looks like 4, 3, 6, 3, 3, 11, off, although I run farther if able) but my work hours are so long I don't have time to both run properly and sleep. I've been just doing quick 1-3 mile run whenever I can squeeze it in (like if I get off work half an hour early) and sticking with my long runs

I really wish I could run 20 miles every weekend and call it good, because running in the dark after a 13 hour day kinda sucks. Right now I plan to stick to as many miles as often as I can during the week (I ran just one mile before, and one mile after work yesterday for example) and the same long run.

Any thoughts, experiences? I didn't plan on having to work so many extra hours, or be so damn tired so I have to adapt

Edit: That's what my base build looks like on PAPER :)",1511941713

Ultramarathon,cleanfarmer,Does a 10x5k count as an ultra?,"I am going to run a [10x5k](https://www.ccprc.com/2063/Ultra-Chili-10x5K-5K) next year as my first long distance run.  From the community's perspective, does this count as an ultra marathon since the 5k starts on the hour every 10 hours and its not a continuous run?
Regardless of if it counts, I will be doing it as my longest run to date.  As a true Born to Run (B2R) fanboy, my eye has been on ultramarathon running since reading it.  My longest run before B2R was 3 miles and completely exhausted.  While listening to it on audiobook, I easily trail-ran 6+ miles (and only quit to go to work at a reasonable time and not be fired.)
Is a 10x5k reasonable considering my longest run to date is 10 miles before work and 10 after work.  It seems to me 10 separate 3 mile runs would be reasonable without further preparation.  (This is in a year so I will be training in this burst style anyway)",1511444470

Ultramarathon,DesignProjectGroup,Looking for some feedback on an app prototype designed for ultramarathon runners,"Hi!

We’re a group of 4 students at a university in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently we’re working on a design project where the task is to design and prototype a web application that could help ultra marathon runners with their running. 

This is the first step of our prototype where we’ve made a short (and slightly embarrassing) video that describes the role of the prototype and in very simple terms explains the concept of the web application. If anyone would like more information on the project we’re happy to provide it.

If you could watch our video (linked below) and give us feedback we would greatly appreciate it! The feedback could be concerning:

 - The video

 - The concept of the app and it’s peripheral insole

 - The necessity of such an app/product

 - The low production quality that we’re unreasonably proud of :)

If you would like to give any comments on your needs as ultramarathon runners in your training and/or if those needs are something that can be fulfilled by technology, that would also be appreciated!

Ultramarathon,billbobb1,Are there any suspicions that Courtney Dauwalter cheated?,"Hi, 
I just heard Courtney Dualwater on Joe Rogans podcast. She gave a great interview. 

I am a recreational runner, but admittedly I am not familiar with ultra marathons.  I'm blown away by her recent performance where she came in first, nearly ten hours faster than the next competitor male or female.  That seems like such a huge gap between first and second place. Again, admity I'm pretty ignorant to this sport. Are such large time gaps between top competitors common in ultra marathons?

Within the untra marathon community, is there suspicion that Courtney cheated in some way?  If so, how do you suspect it could it have been done?

### Goals

|------|-------------|------------|
| A |Top 5 | *?* |
| B |4:25 | *??* |

### Pre-race
This was my first race where my training didn't really get derailed in any significant way. I got up to a new peak of 60 miles in a week a couple times, and that was 60 miles with ~8k ft of elevation gain, so not bad for me.

I knew the race had a lot of flat (about 12 miles) and 3 massive climbs, so I did a lot of flat + a big climb up to the top of a butte in training. I also ran part of the course on a vacation out at the coast, which was good. It helped me figure out the path through Yachats and I also got a feel for the fact that the single track is nice, but with lots of roots.

I did get a minor cold a few days before the race. I thought it would go away before the race, but the night of the race I still had a little congestion and I had to drink extra water to fend off a dry throat, so that had me worried.

### Start

At the starting line at the beach I quickly positioned myself closest to the wet sand. I didn't want to deal with any dry sand. Then all of the professional / semi-professional runners came up and stood next to me! Was kinda fun getting to hear them talk before the start. One guy was saying that he just did a 100 mile race 3 weeks before, so he probably wasn't going for the win. If it had been 5 weeks before, he'd be fine, but 3 weeks was a bit close. He still ran sub 4 hours!

The weather was crazy-nice. A little bit of a tailwind down the beach, overcast almost the whole way but no rain. Cool temps.

### To Aid Station #1 Miles [1] to [7]

Most of this was a flat beach run. I'd planned on running 7:40 miles for the flat, as I'd found previous Strava races for people who finished around 4:25 and did that. I was hoping to be top 5, and expecting to be top 10, but I knew I wouldn't be starting out in that place. I wanted to reel people in over the course of the race. Even so, I started out at about 7:15 miles with 20 people ahead of me! I was surprised how fast people took it out. Got in a couple 7:40, but 7:15 felt good so I mostly just went with it. And it wasn't like I was running 6:40 at 7,000 ft on an uphill like I did the first mile of my last 50k ... that was not a good start.

There were a couple stream crossings on the beach, but the water was only a couple inches deep, so I was able to step in the shallows and keep sand out of my shoes. I really went all out with a plan to change my shoes at the first aid station. My crew had luke warm water in an ice cube tray and a towel and new socks and shoes, but I didn't need it. I heard later that they let someone else use the water and towel, so I'm glad someone got to enjoy my forethought!

### To Aid Station #2 Miles [7] to [14]

A few more miles of mostly flat, and then we got to the first nice hill. I passed a few more people as we started leaving the flat, and was probably running in 10th or so. I was still fresh for the first climb from about 0ft to nearly 1000ft over about 2.5 miles so it wasn't bad. I spent about a mile of it slooowly gaining on someone and passing him. It took a little longer than normal because he heard my snot rockets from a long way off and sped up a bit. I am not a stealthy runner!

Once you get to the top there are some crazy views from the cliff tops of the ocean. They haven't posted race photos yet, so I haven't seen mine, but it's a cool photo spot.

Then you go straight back down to the first aid station. Even with the switch backs it's a little too steep to really let loose. -726 ft over 1 mile according to Strava!

### To Aid Station #3 Miles [14] to [19.5]

Refilled some Tailwind at the aid station and scooted out of there. Took a little longer than I like, and someone passed me there, but I got him back pretty quickly when we started doing some little uphills again.

After the aid station there's a nice rolling section that parallels the Oregon Coast Hwy (but far above it). I'd done a 3 mile run on this section the day before, which turned out to be useful. SO many roots and I remembered where some of them were. Even trees in the middle of the trail, hidden by other trees in the middle of the trail!

After that it's a long long climb to the 2nd to last aid station. I caught up with someone on this climb, which was nice because I hadn't really seen anyone for miles. We talked a bit about our goals, and I also was able to let him know that most GPS tracks of the race end up 2 or 3 miles short, which is really handy to know if you're using a GPS for pace.

We ran together for most of the uphill. Part of it was more a sharp, rocky creek bed than a trail, and I was glad that was an uphill-only part of the trail. We also got passed by a guy who was seriously killing it on that uphill. I tried to go with him, but I could tell I couldn't keep up so I dropped back down to my mere 12 to 14 minute pace going up 400 to 600 ft per mile!

### To Aid Station #4 Miles [19.5] to [24]

I knew this would be by far the shortest gap between aid stations. In addition to only being 4.5 miles, it's mostly downhill, and not quite as steep as some of the other downhills. I really tried to put on the burners here. Passed one guy, and put some distance between me and the guy I did the uphill with, so it worked. 

Still too steep / rolling / rocky to run as fast as the flat but 8:20 miles or so are pretty good IMO. Part of it had tons of little round rocks and leaves, so that was a pain. My running mantra for a mile or two was ""blink baby blink"" just to remind myself to blink my eyes, so I didn't tear up, step on a rock, and wipe out.

I did have a funny moment where when I came across the 2nd photo shoot I had a water bottle in my hands covered in Tailwind powder and a zip lock baggie half full with Tailwind in the other. Classic racing photo for me. I'm really good at making them bad!

### To Finish Miles [24] to [31.1]

And this is where the race got real. Which is a funny thing to say, because no one passed me, and I didn't pass anyone from here on out. I barely even saw anyone.

I really started psyching myself out about what time I would finish with. Like I said, GPS gets off in terms of total miles on this course, so I wasn't sure how much I had left. I really wanted my arbitrary 4:25 time (my PR was 2:31 on an easier course), and my previous aid station arrivals times indicated I should've been been on track for a little better, but I felt like I was really slowing down on the 3rd climb. I'd practiced 2 x 1000ft climbs in training, but not 3!

So in my exhausted fog brain I kept thinking I was going too slow when I looked at the watch. Eventually I convinced myself to stop looking at the watch and just run, which was good. Got my wheels back under me after the last climb, and when I got to the flat I got back up to speed, and even finished with my fastest mile of the race!

Ended it with 4:29 and 7th out of 253 starters. But only 3rd Nathan. I barely podiumed for my name. WTF?!!

### Post-race

I didn't meet either of my goals, but I was happy with the race. There was some tough competition, and from having looked at most of the runners ahead of me on Strava, they're all clearly better than me at this point in time, so I think I did a great job with my pacing and performance.

My wife has come to all my races, but my parents and my kids came to this one too, so it was fun getting to hang out with them and have them see a little bit of the race! My 3 year old son said he didn't like the race because he had fun watching me run.

I really like the prizes / swag from this race too. The shirt is a a nice Patagonia shirt I would actually consider wearing in a race, the finisher's cup is insulated metal, so not going to break.

### Future Plans

I'm sort of considering doing a 50 miler on November 11th ... I really probably shouldn't do it. I should give myself an easy couple months, and then jump into training for the Eugene Marathon in Spring 2018 (my next planned A race.) But I'm not sure. It's the first year of the 50 miler, and I think it would be fun to do a race in its first year!

Ultramarathon,welcomebrand,Self Transcendence 24 hour track race [Report],"*(Cross posted from ARTC)* 

24 hours running around a track doesn’t sound much fun but I honestly can’t recall many races I’ve enjoyed more even though I was literally miles off my targets.

The [Sri Chinmoy 24 hour Self Transcendence Race](https://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/london-24/) is one of the UK’s longest established and popular 24 hour track races at Tooting Bec in London and I was fortunate enough to have secured one of the 45 places at the start line despite my relatively meager ultra running experience.

I was thrilled because after a few recent race disappointments – a poor mental effort at the Kirklees Way Ultra saw me retire after only 17 miles because my head wasn’t in the game and a wrong turn at the Toss ‘O’ Coin race that cost me the win – I’d long been seeking a “pure” running challenge. No nav, no carrying a pack – nothing to focus on but moving forward. This was my other A race for the year after London Marathon (another disappointing race).

**Training**

My training for this event has been sporadic and in reality, non-specific so while I’ve been able to keep to somewhere between 45-65mpw it’s been largely made up of short run mileage and apart from a track marathon session my prep generally lacked time on feet that I’d need but I was confident from having done the White Rose 100 in the past I would at least be able to keep going for 24 hours.

Generally I feel I’ve reached a plateau training wise because I’m in that zone where I’m not focused 100% on speed or distance so while things like parkrun times are reasonably fast still, I’m not pushing through that sub 17 time regularly and without spending 3+ hours on long runs at the moment the distance stamina is not quite there either once I go beyond a marathon.

My goals for the race ranged from laughable (130 miles) to possible (100 miles in 18h) to specific (180km in 24h which would qualify for Spartathlon).

**Race format**

Pretty much anyone you speak to beyond the people who enjoy this sort of event look at you like you’re an alien when you tell them you’re looking forward to running around a track for 24 hours.

The benefits of a track race to me are obvious – easy access to food and drink at any time, lap counters who cheer you on through each lap as the hours pass and one of the best parts is that you’re sharing the track with 44 other competitors who are never more than a couple of hundred meters away.

The race starts at noon Saturday and you simply clock up as many laps as possible before the race ends at noon on Sunday. You’re free to stop and start as you see fit and your pace is up to you.

Without too much hassle, I’d registered on the morning, the pre-race brief took place and before I knew it we were all on the start line ready to go at 12 noon.

**Race breakdown**

It’s hard to mentally break down a race of this size. When you’re running a point to point race you know the faster you run, the sooner you reach the finish. In a timed race your pace obviously counts but the clock doesn’t tick any faster and it’s all about zoning out for hours at a time and just keeping moving.

**First 12 hours**

I didn’t really have any specific pacing plan other than go slowly and keep it sustainable for as long as possible – ideally getting somewhere near halfway at midnight before really taking any significant break – at which point I’d hoped to be way past 100km/62 miles.

I felt comfortable running for the first few hours, somewhere around 9:30-10min/mile pace, no significant effort heart rate wise and legs felt alright but it’s a bit of a shuffle compared to normal shorter distance easy pace which is a couple of minutes faster but this was fine.

Laps were ticking off at about two and a half minutes and with all the other runners on the track it’s good having the distraction of all the other runners nearby to chat with or tuck in with and run alongside. Seeing the lead runners going out at somewhere around 7 min/mile pace and just maintain it for hours was mind blowing. The first man and lady ran more than 300 miles combined.

The forecast showers arrived not long after the start but only really lasted a couple of hours on an off so weren’t a massive issue and the temperature was perfect for running during daylight although as darkness came it did get pretty chilly and slowing down a bit meant about 11pm I changed into a merino base layer and kept my jacket on but stayed in shorts.

I’d had some stomach issues in the first couple of hours but it was just gas, but the old “never trust a fart” mantra rang strong and a couple of trips to the trackside toilets were needed but eventually it settled down and apart from that, I was able to eat and drink with absolutely no issues for the duration of my race.

I took 24 Gu gels which I’d planned to use for most of the race but ultimately with a refreshment table on the track with drinks and various bits of food I took 1 gel and just ate from the table every couple of laps.

**From running to walking**

I went through the 100km mark a little after midnight, not the fastest but steady enough and after having already figured my 130 mile goal was so far beyond my capability at the moment I’d focused on the 180km Spartathlon time as my only significant aim. With 100km on the clock in 12 hours I’d still need to move strongly for the second half but ultimately should have been able to do it in the time limit as I felt good at midnight with no issues beyond a bit of general fatigue.

Things went south pretty quickly in the hour that followed though.

My legs, feet and stomach felt fine, my head was in the game and I was having a truly excellent time but my hip flexors suddenly began to tighten and I went from moving comfortably to a power walk.

This in itself wasn’t an issue, I’d planned on walking spells but in between running laps rather than an hour or two at a time. Still – in-race management of issues is part of the challenge I guess and I switched mindset to thinking that even if I had to power walk at 3.5mph I’d just about make 100 miles in 24 hours but I assumed that at some point after a spell of walking I’d manage another hour or two of running which would bring the 180km goal back into focus.

I’d accepted this and spent the next couple of hours walking around the track listening to 6Music on the little DAB radio I’d bought with me although to be honest, Jethro Tull for 2 hours in the middle of the night wasn’t my bag.

**The pain**

Eventually my hips settled and I felt good enough to start running again and was clocking off about 30-40 minutes an hour of running mixed with walking for the remainder. Felt good enough but somewhere around 16 hours a deep fatigue started setting in and I was struggling to stay awake, yawning constantly while following the white line around the track.

I’d not planned to really stop for anything other than toilet breaks and clothes changes during the race (the clock never stops right!) but I figured a 15 minute power-nap would be more beneficial than falling asleep on my feet and I could reset and get back out there.

A quick lie down in the room next to the track was welcome but when I woke up, I simply couldn’t move my left leg!

Somewhere in and around my hip abductors the pain was immense. I had to pull my leg up with my hands just to get to my feet. As I rejoined the track at a hobble, the pain made it clear something had gone wrong while I’d laid down and my plans of power walking or running weren’t going to happen. I couldn’t make it round another lap.

Another benefit of the track format is there’s a physio on site so I went to see her and she recommended another hour of rest to see if it settled. Back to the room for a lie down and actually sleep.

**Retirement**

When I woke, the pain was still as intense as before and sitting down on the chair in the physio room for a checkup I literally couldn’t lift my foot off the floor. My race was done with about 7 hours remaining on the clock.

Ultimately I managed to walk one more lap a couple of hours later as my hip settled down a bit and there will probably be a fraction of doubt as to whether I should have just waited a couple of hours instead and decided then or whether an hour was enough to know but ultimately that single lap ticked me through 130km and I figured that’s alright for now.

Frustrating in many respects because my legs and feet still actually felt fine and mentally I’d had no significant lows or doubts at any point.

**Self Transcendence**

&gt;“Running offers us the message of transcendence. In our running, every day we are aiming at a new goal….. … every day we are running towards a goal, but when we reach that goal, we want to go still farther. Either we want to improve our timing or increase our distance. There is no end. Running means continual transcendence, and that is also the message of our inner life.”

&gt;Sri Chinmoy

I have to say that for me the biggest success of this race after missing all my goals was that I feel I’ve embraced a little of the spirit of self transcendence. Not just in that I’ve come away feeling I have so much more I can put on the line in races and so much more I can do in my training.

My Suunto died only a few hours into the race and I have to say it was refreshing to make the choice to run without it. I had planned on it needing charging on the go and had a power pack but I couldn’t be bothered – it was a decision I’ll probably stick to in long track races because there’s a beautiful simplicity in just running until you break or someone says to stop.

**Issues and improvements**

To be honest, despite finishing early I still covered 80 miles/130km in about 17 hours. Not the fastest but was comfortably on target to hit 100+ miles on what was my track ultra debut so although my initial big goal was comically out of whack, I think the 180km would be well within reach.

Training wise – I think despite reasonable mileage I lacked time on my feet in the form of some decent long runs and hadn’t done any core and hip strengthening which ultimately was my downfall so easy enough to rectify in training for next time.

Food and drink wise, with a table of refreshments on the track I only used one of my Gu gels and didn’t really have any issues on that front. It was easy to take really small amounts of food and drink regularly.

I also only ended up changing top once from a tech tee to a long sleeve merino when it got dark and colder and had my waterproof jacket on for the showers and I found the swapping race numbers a bit of a faff – I’d get a race belt next time because on another day, if it were warmer or more changeable weather I could see going through a few tops or changes of shorts so a belt just helps minimise hassle.

**Track ultras**

Would I do another track race? Absolutely!

I can honestly say that despite everything not going right goal wise, this was one of the most interesting and fun race experiences I’ve ever had.

It’s a very social race, with the counters, other runners crews and race staff combining with the fact you’re in close proximity with everyone for the duration means the time ticks by a lot quicker than you’d think and you really do get into a rhythm as the hours pass.

A massive thank you to Shankara, race team and of course all the lap counters for making a truly memorable race experience. I’ll be signing up as soon as the ballot opens next year!

Last, but no means least, a massive congratulations to my club mate Sam who covered 100 miles with a half hour to spare!

Ultramarathon,coraythan,Do you Strava Stalk?,"I just discovered the amazing awesomeness that is Strava stalking! I always thought Strava was just somewhere you give people kudos on their races and record your activities, but it's *so much more*.

I was looking at other people entered into my upcoming 50k on ultra sign up, when I thought ""I could search these names on strava and figure out if they are faster than me or have trained more to guess what place I'm likely to get."" So I did that. Then I realized I could search people from last year's race too. *evil laugh*

Before I knew it I had found a Strava segment that corresponds with the race course and I had **tons of Strava activities from the race to pour over**. I could see how 4 hour winners paced on the flats and the climbs and descents. I could see 4.5 hour runners, 5 hour runners. I could pull up my training runs on my second monitor and compare my pace at different intensities and climb grade to the actual race.

Am I a creep? Is this the most perfectly geeky running thing I've ever done? I think so.

Mostly I'm just excited to better analyze what kind of pacing I should go for. In past ultras I've gone too slow, too fast, just right, etc. during different portions of races. I think I can pace myself well off of feel, but I also think knowing some splits will help.

Has anyone else done this for their races, or am I uniquely devious?",1505983543
Ultramarathon,jaseman2000,Alcohol and training?,"Craft beer and ultra training seem to go hand in hand. For my first 50 miler, I didn't drink alcohol for the three months during intensive training. I drank a little bit after the three months were up, but about two months ago I decided to give up alcohol entirely. During my training, I felt like I recovered better from long runs, slept better, and in general trained better and felt really good.

Out of curiosity, does anyone else either not drink while training or not drink in general, and if so, does it impact your training?

Just to clear the air, I drank for a long time, so this is not an anti-alcohol post. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience.

Thanks, all &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3",1505763128
Ultramarathon,nerdrunner,How to taper when running races close together?,"I'm planning on running a marathon (road race, will be my third time completing that distance) followed by my first ultra (50k trail run) three weeks later. I would have liked more time between races, but I had been holding off on attempting a 50k, then I saw one I liked and bit the bullet. I don't plan to go all-out for the full but I'd like to run it somewhat faster than a long training run.

I'm in week 14 of Hal Higdon's Intermediate 1 plan (http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51139/Marathon-Intermediate-1-Training-Program). Here are the last several weeks, with weekly totals and that week's long run:
Wk 14. 35mi/wk (12mi long) (where I am now), 
Wk 15. 43mi/wk (20mi long), 
Wk 16. 32mi/wk (12mi long, taper week 1), 
Wk 17. 24mi/wk (8mi long, taper week 2), 
Wk 18. 35mi/wk (26.2mi long), 
Wk 19. 24 to 32mi/wk (12mi long ?), 
Wk 20. 24 to 32mi/wk (12mi long ?), 
Wk 21. 41mi/wk (32mi long).

I know I should focus on recovery following the marathon, but I also don't think I should skimp on the long runs those weekends. Any advice? Or should I stop overthinking it and just go out for an hour or two depending on feel?",1505745059
Ultramarathon,ultrathrowawaygirl,Just ran my first trail marathon -- is going for a 60-miler in february too ambitious?,"I'm 22 years old, have a lot of time to dedicate to running, and really want to run a 50-miler in February. I just ran my first trail marathon last week and had a blast. I felt like I could have run more miles after it; I wasn't wrecked too hard by it. 

I'm averaging around 45 mpw right now. I'm training for a 50k in November which should be around the same difficulty level as the marathon (the marathon had crazy elevation gains). I'm planning to ratch up to mid 60s mpw by the time of the 60-miler. 

My training plan is: 

**September 18 - 24** -- 40

**September 25 - October 1** -- 44 

**October 2 - 8** -- 47.5

**October 9 - 15** -- 36

**October 16 - 22** -- 51

**October 23 - 39** - 54

**October 30 - November 5** -- 44

**November 6 - 12** -- 57

**November 13 -- 19** -- taper for 50k

**November 20 - 26** -- recover from 50k 

**November 27 - December 3** -- 52

**December 4 - 10** -- 57

**December 11 - 17** -- 50

**December 18 - 24** -- 62

**December 25 - 31** -- 65

**January 1 - 7** -- 55

**January 8 - 14** -- 70

**January 15 - 21** -- taper

**January 22 - 28** -- taper 

**February 3** -- **100k race**

The 60 miler I'm planning to run in February has about 7700 ft net elevation gain and a 16.5 hour cut-off time. (the marathon I ran had about 5000 ft net gain so I feel like I'm gonna be ok on the elevation part). My plan is just 1. to finish within 16.5 hours and 2. not be dead last. I'm a slow runner (around 10:00 mile pace) and am definitely not thinking of doing fast runs / going for speed during training, because I get injured significantly more when I do speed stuff. 

**Questions:**

1. Is going for a 60 miler in February too ambitious, or is it doable? Would you recommend against it? 

2. Is my training plan okay? 

3. Am I  begging for injuries or is this pretty doable?

Ultramarathon,coraythan,Help me pick a replacement Ultra?,"Just got the sad news that the Gorge Waterfalls 100k is canceled for next year, which means I need to replan my race schedule next year.

I had been planning on doing Gorge Waterfalls 100k in April, and Mountain Lakes 100m in September as my A races, probably with a couple conveniently timed 50ks as B training races. Still planning on doing Mountain Lakes 100m as it seems like a relatively gentle introduction to the distance.

So anyway, I was hoping for recommendations on an early-to-mid year race next year.

Here are things I care about:

Ideally 100k, but 50m would be okay. (I've done Tillamook Burn 50m this year.)

Proximity. I live in Eugene, Oregon, so Oregon is best, Washington and northern California are okay, and anywhere along the way to Grand Junction (south western) Colorado could be used as an excuse for a family trip to visit my in-laws.

Timing: Ideally March, April, or May. That gives me time for a break after my upcoming race, and a separate training cycle for my 100m next year. but I could go a month or two earlier or later.

Other than that I'm just interested in hearing if there are any races people thought were really nice for one reason or another! ",1505444261

My next big race is a 12 hour race in December on a 10 mile out-and-back course (5 miles out, 5 miles back). My understanding is that there is an aid station at the 5 mile turnaround point and one at the 10 mile/start area. So in theory I could probably make handhelds work and save my money.

Ultramarathon,Chicago_Blackhawks,a 19 year old first timer asking for advice,"Hey runners! I am a 19 year old, planning on running my first ultra on September the 2nd, a 50K. I have ran about 5 half-marathons in my running career.

This past month and a half, I have gone on about 6 long runs, about one a week, working my way up from around 3 miles to 10 miles, and I am about to go for 15-17, after which I will decrease the workload. 

I don't run the whole distance - I am running a mile, walking a mile - which is how I plan on running the ultra. In my off-days, I have been remaining relatively active. In my training runs, especially the 10 mile runs, I have felt pretty good - only some fatigue in my legs/feet.

Here's my question:

I'm worried that I have trained up too quickly / haven't put in enough mileage for the race. I want to run the race no matter what, but should I be worried about injury? If I can make it through 15 feeling just fine, is there a need to worry? I have been recovering thoroughly.

Ultramarathon,bizbup,Salt &amp; Electrolyte Tablets,"Any suggestions of what to read or what to get?

I know there’s no science to stop cramping issues, so that’s not the issue. But I am a heavy sweater (I train a lot indoors from treadmill training) and I’ve had hydration and nausea issues from running outside, where I don’t have as ready access to water (I try to run with a hydration pack but not all races allow them). At a marathon, I presented with symptoms and was given a basic salt (think restaurant) package, which helped. At another ultra race, an aid station suggested a pill that had salt and magnesium (I forget the name but maybe Hammer Endurolytes), which also helped. I’ve never otherwise taken anything (I do use gels during training and races).

I’m generally hesitant about supplements and I’ve been reading lots of articles on electrolyte supplements, but many are marketing puffery or confuse me with too much science and conflicting statements among them. I’ve used the search in this sub but it seems to go back and forth with lots of commentary on no effect about cramps, which is why I started this paragraph (and I don’t get cramps). My main goal is to be properly hydrated, replace what I’ve sweat out and avoid nausea (I think hydration and not food is the cause of this issue because I generally only have gels and have only done 50ks but plan to do a 50M). If it matters, I’m masters level and otherwise well trained for the distance and my pace.

Last year, although not typical, it rained for about 14 hours straight up in the mountains.  Although I don't expect this to happen again, I have to be prepared for it. I know I was alarmingly close to hypothermia, as I had been wet and cold from to bottom for so many hours. 

 I had many layers to swap and change into throughout the race, but none did much because they just got sopping wet within minutes.  

I had a wind and waterproof outer layer jacket (it's a cycling jacket) that I wore throughout the rain but it was not at all breathable so ultimately it ended up just trapping tons of water and sweat inside.

Unfortunately for my racing plans (but fortunately for my life plans) I'm getting married in October and immediately heading out on the honeymoon for 2 weeks. I'll get back with 3 weeks to go before the 50k race.

So, that leaves me with a bit of a predicament - timing-wise, that's when I'd want to be peaking with my training. Is it incredibly foolish to press on and run the 50k anyway (my first ultra), or should I scale back and sign up for the trail marathon that weekend? 

I'm nowhere near competitive for this kind of race, so my plan is to train my best and run the race I'm prepared for after that, no matter how slow haha.

For back to back long runs, does it matter which order I do them in? 

Second question: I was planning on using my marathon as my longest long run (maybe do one more at 28 miles since I have 6 weeks in between) but I also plan to go all out for my marathon. Should I skip my medium long run the day after my marathon for recovery? I planned on taking a recovery week and halving my miles for that week before I do my 28 mile run the week after.


Thoughts? Advice? Thanks!",1498750061
Ultramarathon,ultrablanco,Dumb training question from a newb to the sport,"I am getting into ultras and want to run a 50K near the end of the year. I am currently training 30-50 miles per week and plan to ramp up to 100 miles. However I live in San Francisco and run mostly on streets. I am wondering if other ultra marathoners train on streets vs on trails, or what the ratio of street training to trail training is. I would prefer to train on trails but it is not easy for me to get to Marin during the hours I have the ability to train (rush hour). But I will, if training on streets is just an all around bad idea. Thanks!

TL;DR - Should I train for an ultra on streets or find some trails?",1498667707

Ultramarathon,SouthAussie94,Am I being stupid even considering this? 56km Ultra Trail Marathon,"I'm a newcomer to running, only beginning to take it seriously at the beginning of the year. Since then I've run two races (12km and 14km). In an average week I'd run between 10-20km. Most of this consists of flat paths along the coast, with a few hillier runs thrown in. 

My longest 'run' to date is a 21km trail run with 700m of elevation gain (according to Strava). This took me 2.5 hours to complete and I'd estimate that I ran about 2/3-3/4 of the distance. I was quite sore immediately after, but by the end of the day I was fine. I followed this up with 1 rest day before a 14km run. 

I'm aiming to run a half marathon in mid-August. 

I travelled through Europe last year and I did some hiking in Italy. When I returned home, I began hiking somewhat regularly. In September last year, I was hiking through a nearby National Park where an 56km Ultramarathon was starting. I didn't even know that these distances were an actual event at that time and I set myself a goal to enter the event within two years. It was this that motivated me to start running. 

Entries for this years edition of the race have just opened up. Part of me is thinking about entering. 

The race has a time limit of 11.5 hours and I feel that I will be able to complete the distance within this time. Am I stupid for even considering entering the race this year as my longest run to date is only 21km? 

There are 14 weeks (99 days) between today and this years running of the race. If I did enter, my goal would be simply to complete the distance. Time (as long as I beat 11.5 hours) would be a secondary consideration. 

Am I being stupid even considering this?

* [Mile 38 coming into the 2nd to last aid station](http://imgur.com/a/Gmp17)


## Training
This was my first 50 mile race. I’d done one 50k last year, and another as a training race for this 4 weeks ago. Started training in December with 80 miles that month, then averaged about 35 miles per week leading up to the race. A lot of that on trails with a lot of vert near my house.

## Pre-race
I’d never gone this distance before, nor a race with this much vert per mile (about 9k feet elevation gain this year), so I wasn’t really sure what time to gun for. Instead I decided to go against the advice of everyone everywhere and stay in the top 10 (in addition to just pacing by feel in general).

Race started at 6:00 a.m. Early enough to be light out, but still very cold. As forecast it turned out to be a perfect day. No rain, partially cloudy and most of the race in the low 40s F to high 50s F.

## Race

### Start to Aid Station 2 (Story Burn) *0-12 miles*
Started out around 10th to 15th place with some people going pretty darn fast. Beginning was mostly flat with some mild uphill, and I was glad to see everyone running the uphills. (My first ultra I started out too far back and ended up walking some hills I should’ve ran.) They were going fast, though. Like 8 minute miles uphill or something. After a few miles I dropped back and started mostly running by myself at a more sustainable pace.

The trails were awesome. Soft single track trails with only a couple short rocky sections, and there hadn’t been too much rain the last couple days so it wasn’t too muddy. Because of the storm and all the trees that came down they had to change the course somewhat, so the first aid station ended up being less than 4 miles into the race. That was too bad. I use Tailwind, and I’d barely started drinking by then, so I had to make it 12 miles to the 2nd aid station for a refill.

On the way to the 2nd aid station there was a big rolling climb, then a big rolling descent. The descent had a ton of little creeks going across the trail. Maybe 10? I managed to rock hop or long jump over all of them and not get my shoes wet, which was nice, because it let me keep my feet dry almost the whole race … until I hit those creeks on the way back, of course!

###Aid Station 2
Made it into the 2nd aid station, which is a central one you hit three times, in about 1:50, which was pretty good. My wife was waiting with bottles already prepped with Tailwind, so that was awesome! Learned later on that the directions to the aid station were difficult to follow, and she got lost and barely made it on time. So definitely recommend your crew maps it out and memorizes their own directions ahead of time if you have crew.

Came into the aid station in 11th, but left in about 8th place. Grab ‘n’ go FTW! 

###Aid Station 2 to Aid Station 4 (Story Burn 2) *12-28 miles*
The next section was also changed. It’s normally a big loop, but instead it was a long (7.7 mile one way to an aid station) out and back to add miles back in for the sections that were closed. Started with a long, bombing descent on nice trail through the trees. Ended up being rolling up and down for most of it. Again, really nice trails. A guy named Brad caught up with me and I ran most of it with him. Really nice having some conversation and someone to push me.

###Aid Station 4 to Aid Station 5 (Larch Mountain) *28-34.5 miles*
Got back to the central aid station. The aid stations were a little farther apart than I’m used to, so I mixed extra Tailwind with water at this one which took a couple minutes. That kinda sucked, because Brad left about 100ft ahead of me for the climb up Larch mountain, which became a bit of a theme. I think I chased him for 3 or 4 miles before I finally caught up. The Larch Mountain loop was a gravel road with the most interminably slight uphill slope imaginable, followed by an aid station at the top and then a crazy steep gravel road down. (7 miles up and 4 miles down, with about 2 miles of that shared, so it was more than twice as steep going down as it was going up.) Usually there’s a little trail you take to go to the real top of the mountain, but that was another damaged trail section this year.

###Aid Station 5 to Aid Station 6 (Story Burn 3) *34.5-38 miles*
I was in about 7th place at the top of Larch Mountain, and I’d been thinking for a while that I was in the sweet spot between the “crazy runners who can win the race” ahead of me, and the “crazy runners who will win age divisions older than mine” behind me. This is when one of the later passed me! He was looking so good it was disgusting, and mile 36ish is when things started getting ugly for me. I’d never run that far before, and I could really feel it. Pain, mental second guessing.

###Aid Station 6 to Aid Station 7 (Bell Camp) *38-46 miles*
Got into the central aid station for the last time. Only 12 miles left and mostly downhill! Yay! I thought I would just take two bottles of tailwind (about 300 calories and 30 oz water) and be good, at least until the aid station with 4 miles left. WRONG.

The first 2 miles or so were great. I experienced rubber leg for the first time, but everything hurt so much I felt like I could bomb the descents and it didn’t even matter. Then the wheels came off. I’d gotten ahead of the guy who looked super-together at the aid station, but he passed me back. Despite knowing I was in 7th ish place I felt like my top 10 finish goal couldn’t survive my murderously slow pace. I wanted to quit running entirely for the first time. I was in a zone of pain and mental self-doubt I’ve never experienced. Also started going loopy from lack of blood sugar for my brain. There was a long long uphill, but that was less horrible than when it started going downhill again because I didn’t feel guilty for walking the uphill, but felt horrible for running the downhills so slow!

Anyway that sucked.

###Aid Station 7 to Finish *46-50 miles*
Got to the aid station with 4 downhill miles left, and that really saved me. Broke my all Tailwind fueled day to eat potato chips and PB&amp;J. Got water / energy drink from the incredibly helpful volunteers (first time I actually let them help me, so thanks for being there when I needed you despite how often I just blazed on through!)

I actually passed a guy at this point. I was kinda in shock because I’d been sure for a long time that someone would catch up with me. Last four miles were passable. The food gave my brain what it needed to pull itself out of the ditch.

## Post-race
Finished in 6th place and 8:23:30! I kinda like setting unrealistic goals for myself, so it’s extra-sweet when I can actually exceed them. Managed to not quite cry hugging my wife at the finish. 

## Post-Post race and future
I’d been planning to run a 100 miler next year but I’m not anymore. I might do a 100k, not sure. Going into it I kinda expected to enjoy doing a 50 miler more than 50ks, but after the fact I don’t think I did. It’s possible with better training and experience and fueling I won’t end up in a horrible funk, and will enjoy it a lot more, but I’m not sure.

My toenails hurt. I will probably lose at least one. That would be a new experience. My knees hurt. And ... I think I pulled / slightly tore a muscle. The muscle on the front of the outer side of my lower left leg (the internet calls it the tibialis anterior) really hurts, and now a day later there is a red spot and bruising. So following the internet's advice on that with icing, raising the leg. Going to have crutches tomorrow and will go see the doctor depending on how it seems tomorrow.

I just hope it's a mild injury that doesn't require surgery. I wish I had prepared well enough to not do something like this to myself, but I at least hope it only takes a month or two to recover from.

So ouch.

Ultramarathon,Snarky_Sparky,Mid-Run Nutrition:What am I missing?,"Looking for some advice or your experiences. I've just about completed the major blocks of training for my next 50 miler (Ice Age 50 yeeeeee). On my last couple of long trail runs I've gotten the niggling feeling that I'm missing something in my nutrition strategy. Here's what I eat/drink:

- Before: coffee, egg burrito, electrolyte pill

- Every 15 min: a few slurps of a Gatorade mix (mixed from powder, watered down a bit with some salt thrown in)

- Every 30 min: Hammer Gels, either Espresso or Huckleberry 

- Whenever I can get it: PBJ, potato chips, bananas 

Where I'm running into issues is on runs of 4 or more hours now that its starting to warm up. After a while I start to get a little bit of gut rot, and I start to lose my appetite to the point of not being able to get solid food down. I sometimes feel like I might be thirsty despite drinking a lot of liquid (feeling kind of ""sloshy"") and start to fantasize about the taste of plain water but I'm worried that I won't get enough back from just drinking water. 

Last fall this happened during a tough 50k but I worked through it by mashing bananas and kind of shotgunning them at aid stations and trying to get more salt. I sweat a lot.

I've run (relatively easy) 50ks before. But if I give myself two weeks to recover from the marathon, I'm already heading towards late May. I basically have two months to get ready for this 50 miler. Is that enough?

I've been averaging 75 miles a week since December 1 so I've got a good base and I'm not scared to increase that even more. But those have all been road miles. Two months just doesn't sound like much to go from 26.2 to 50.

I am running a marathon in a few weeks. It will be my 5th one. In each of the previous 4, I've experienced cramping to various degrees in the last 4-5 miles.

At the end of my most recent marathon, a fellow runner saw I was suffering a pulled an S! Cap out of his pocket and have it to me. It was the first time I've ever taken anything like that. It was at around mile 23 and it didn't seem to have any effect. Maybe it was just too late.

So I've got a big bottle of them here but haven't used any. Coincidence has had it be cold on all my long runs so far this spring so I haven't really needed them. But this Saturday looks warmer and I've got 20 miles to run. I want to experiment with these S! Caps a little but I'm not sure what to do.

Do you take one before you even start? And then at intervals throughout the run? Or do you wait until you've run for a while?

The Vivoactive is perfectly serviceable for my runs but I doubt it'd last for that long once I get to that point. I DID see that I can charge it while it's still in use, unlike the 920xt. 

Just curious to hear what y'all like and recommend. Thanks!",1489289773
Ultramarathon,joelrunyon,Running a 12 Hour Marathon Through The New Year (Narrabeen All Nighter),"I ran the Narrabeen All Nighter earlier this year from 6pm December 31st to 6am January 1.

It was on a 5km course (2.5k out, 2.5k back). As many times as you can go in 12 hours. We ran right next to a lagoon and kept hearing a NYE party boat blasting techno music while we were running in the pitch dark :)

Here's the video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgXygA3W53M

If you'd like to read the race review, you can check it out here - https://impossiblehq.com/narrabeen-allnighter-recap/

The event was super small (most people were either running the ""last marathon of 2016"" or the ""first marathon of 2017""), so there was under 100 people doing the ultra.

I'm doing this as part of a project [(777)](http://impossiblehq.com/777) to run 7 ultra marathons on 7 continents to help build 7 schools with a non-profit that builds schools in Ghana, Laos and Guatemala (we've raised $125,000 and counting so far!).

Hope you guys like the video!

Ultramarathon,coraythan,To walk or to run?,"I'm trying to decide how much I should practice walking in my training runs. I've run one hilly 50k in 5 hours, 9:50 mile pace with 4100ft gain. During that race I ran most of the uphills and if I were doing another 50k I would just plan on running almost all of them, but I also felt I did that race too slow and I've improved since then.

My next race is a 50 miler though with 9300ft gain. That's a fair bit more per mile. I'm planning on going for about the same pace, 10:00ish. 

In training I almost feel like it is more tiring to walk uphill than run. I have a lot of uphill running training and have also always considered it one of my strengths as a runner. But I also think I'll probably walk at least the crazy steep uphills during 50 miles.

Anyone have suggestions for walking uphill training? Should I even bother if I prefer running uphill? So far I only walk the crazy steep parts, but that's maybe a couple minutes of walking a couple days a week.

Also, I don't use a heart rate monitor and don't plan to. I go by feel and pace and don't intend to keep my heart rate 100℅ consistent.",1488179907
Ultramarathon,Samesyo,Running induced GI issues,"So I have noticed that GI issues seem to occur more often in the running population more so than other groups. Over this past summer I finished my first 100 miler, this is my second year of ultra running and in this time I have noticed my GI system changing. I'm 25 and was diagnosed with GERD this past fall, foods that I used to eat are not especially easy on my stomach anymore and my bowel habits definitely changed. This all seemed to come about after my first 100 miler, this summer and into the fall I had been pushing 90+ miles a week consistently and a handful or races. Is there any correlation between ultra running and emerging GI issues? Or was it mere coincidence that I developed these issues independent of run volume?",1486486046
Ultramarathon,jokern8,How fast can I do my first ultra?,"In a little more than one month I will run my first ultra. It is a looped 6 hour race on a flat course. At first my goal was to do 50km, now I'm feeling that may be aiming low, how crazy am I if start with a 55km pace?

**Background:**  
In june to september I ran about 50km per training week (missed a few weeks because sickness and busy). In september I ran a few long runs of 30km in 6:30/km pace. 1st oct I ran a trailmarathon in 7:20/km.

In january and february I'm running 70-90km/week. This saturday I ran 21km in 6:05/km and on sunday 25km in 6:25/km.

I'm feeling alot stronger now than I did this fall and the 6 hour race is flat so I feel like I should be able to run alot faster. I don't know how I would feel after 50+km, but I feel like keeping 7:00/km pace would be ""too easy"".

**Questions:**  
How does marathon pace compare with 50-55k pace?  
When deciding pace on a 6 hour pace should I aim for as even pace as possible or positive/negative splitting?  
How much time should I count on spending at the aid station? (My plan is never really stopping, just grabbing food/drinks that I can eat during the next loop, is that feasible?)  ",1486475391
Ultramarathon,rinogo,Weightlifting and ultra running - Train for strength or size?,"tl;dr - Which is more compatible with ultrarunning - weight training for strength, or for size?

----

My fitness goals, crazy or not, are to maintain strength while being in excellent cardiovascular/endurance condition.  I'm not trying to be the strongest guy around, nor the fastest, but I'd like to excel at both.  I'd prefer to skip the debate about whether or not this is a ""good goal"".  It's my personal goal; it's ok if it's not yours! :)


I've been doing the Starting Strength program off and on for a few years, and have successfully maintained decent strength while still being a middle/back-of-the-pack ultra runner.  I'm in the best shape of my life and feel fantastic.


As I'm gearing up for training for the season (100 miler in June), I've been thinking - maybe training for strength (hence, Starting *Strength*) isn't the best approach.  Training for strength emphasizes olympic lifts with higher weight and lower reps. (e.g. typically 3x5)


Perhaps I should be training more for ""size"" - not because I want to be a ""swole bro"", but because training for ""size"" emphasizes the slow twitch muscle type.  Training for ""size"" would involve migrating from 3x5 sets to 3x8, 3x10, or even 3x12.  It seems to me that doing weight training at 3x10 is more in-line with the kind of muscles I'd want to use in ultra running.  In other words, I might have even greater success with my goals if I increase the rep range.


On the flip side, there's a sound argument that hitting my body in two totally different ways encourages what I'm looking for - maintaining strength while having high running endurance as well.


Thoughts?

Ultramarathon,coraythan,Night time wildlife encounters,"So I'm not a morning person, and I work 8 to 5 weekdays. This means when training during the winter I have to run in the dark. I've got a good headlamp and lighted vest, but honestly, I'm still sorta scared running at night sometimes.

Today didn't help. I was running at 6 pm in a park I'm racing in on Saturday to figure out the course. I'm running through the forest and I hear this loud lowing animal sound close by. Stop running and hear it again, so I turn around and run away. I was (and still am) pretty sure it was an elk. There are signs and all warning about elk in that area, though I'd never seen one there before.

Then running back out of the park some guys dogs ran up on me from behind without me realizing it until they were right on top of me which was equally scary.

Other times I've had deer jump out of the brush 5 ft away, nearly giving me a heart attack.

Makes me want to never run at dark unless it's at the local gravel track half a mile from my house.

Eventually I want to do a 100m. Do people always run with company in the woods in the dark? How do you train for that?

Ultramarathon,sbailey1993,"100km ""Supermarathon"" for Cancer. Help please?","My best friend and I are keen on running the Gold Coast 100 Supermarathon to raise money for cancer research after both losing people close to us to this fucking disease recently.
The reason we chose this distance is that the date works best for us and also, when people see us doing a 100km run they will think ""DAMN THAT'S HUGE &amp; GONNA SUCK, BETTER DONATE""

Some details;

-Race is in 19 weeks.

-Both of us work the same job, on our feet for 10-14 hours a day of physical work in temperatures consistently 36-46 degrees Celcius. #outbackaustralia.

-Work is also on a 1 month or 6 weeks on, 4 days off basis. So no weekends or regular days off to schedule long runs.

-Both have no experience running distance races of any kind. And do not run consistently, but have played competitive sports and I would say we are at a medium level of overall fitness.

-Both 23 years old.

Our goal is not to RUN the race, but to finish it.
But it would be nice to be proud of our efforts, not to walk the entire way and also not die in the attempt. Hence the training.

I think that our work will stand us in good stead to deal with the mental suffering part of the run. As this is what I've read is the hardest part.
Working these kind of hours and intensity though and wishing not to be completely wasted at work after training, makes me want to ask for a bit of advice on training.

-We plan to train 4 days a week.

-Over 19 weeks, what kind of distances should we be aiming to hit?

-Can these events be trained for by substituting running for HIIT on one of the running days? Research shows that it increases VO2 max at a greater rate than any other form of training? (This is just an idea, don't scream me out).

-Any other ideas for optimising training results without completely wasting ourselves for work the next day?

-Any recovery tips?

-We are both strictly following the Ketogenic diet, and have been seeing strength/muscular gains in our bodyweight training as well as elevated energy during work and a sharpness of mental state.
Is this diet a boon or bane to endurance training? I haven't found a definitive answer, or anything more than anecdotal evidence.

-Race is run on a flat track. 16 laps.

Any tips, hints or advice is greatly appreciated!

Ultramarathon,pouringlikewater,Knee issues after first 100 mile race.,"Hi everyone,

On January 7th I ran my first 100 mile Ultra at the Croom Zoom in Brooksville, FL. During the last 30 miles or so, My left knee and hip were both in a good deal of pain, but it subsided after I finished the run and wasn't bothering me. Yesterday I tried to go for a short run for the first time since my race and I got about a mile and a half in and the outside of my left knee starting really hurting. From what I have read, this seems to be the IT band inflaming, and the general consensus seems to be that stretching and foam rolling is the best way to combat this. My question is, did I just not give myself a long enough time off? I am a little worried I may have injured myself during the race. I'd like to be able to get back running as soon as I can without risking hurting myself. Has anyone had similar issues? Should I see a doctor? Thanks!",1484827127

Ultramarathon,coraythan,To blow up or not?,"I was reading an interview of Jim Walmsley and I thought some of the advice he would give new ultra runners is really interesting:

""Don’t run with limits. Blowing up is okay. Just problem solve. Figure out how to fix what went wrong, and don’t keep making the same mistakes.""

I feel like I've read a lot of advice saying to be careful and that you don't want to run too fast in a race because it can wreck the whole thing if you bonk, blow your quads, exhaust yourself, etc. But I like the idea of really going after it and testing my limits. How hard do you all go? Should a person new to ultras or new to a distance run so hard they might blow up, or be more conservative and safe?

Ultramarathon,PinkPonySwag,First 50k Training Help,"Hi guys!

I'm hoping to do my first 50k this year, race TBD, but I'm a little stuck on how to train.  Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this mess!

My running/athletic history:

* 4 years of high school field hockey
* 1 year of college field hockey
* 3 years of college rowing (1-4 mile warmup runs 5-6x a week)
* Have run a fall 1/2 marathon the last three years in a row (PR: 2:31:47 - 2016)
* Have run a fall full marathon the last two years in a row (PR: 5:38:26 - 2016)
* 22 years of horseback riding

For the marathons, I used the [30-week Novice Supreme plan from Hal Higdon](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51143/Marathon-Novice-Supreme-Training-Program), which builds from &lt;10 miles to 40 as the peak week (20 mile LR).  I like this schedule and it fits well into my life, but I'm not sure how to make the jump from marathon to 50k and up.  I had wanted to do a spring 50k, but I'm not so sure about my ability to do it safely, given that I haven't done much running since my most recent marathon this past November.

* Do I need to start from such a low mileage point since I've taken about 6 weeks off? Or can I cut down on the length of time I need to get back?
* If my goal is to finish and not suffer for 50k, can I utilize the same marathon plan if I adapt it here and there (shoot more for hours not miles; more trail/elevation)
* [IRunFar](http://www.irunfar.com/2014/06/your-ultra-training-bag-of-tricks-a-newbies-guide-to-ultramarathons.html) suggested that for new ultra-aspiring runners, the goal is to ""build up to where a once-a-week, two- to three-hour easy-effort long run (including hiking breaks) feels easy"" and ""fill the remainder of the week with two to three more easy runs lasting between 30 and 60 minutes"" so you're averaging 4-6 hours of running for at least 3 months before hitting a 50k.  I definitely can handle that, but I'm not sure where to start.  two 30-minute runs during the week and a 1 hour long, building from there?
* Any favorite/beginner-friendly 50k's in the Northeast USA you'd recommend?

I want to keep running for a long time, and I don't mind being slow so long as I'm making forward progress.  I'm out there for the experience, and I want to avoid injuries that hold me back.  Will all the info floating around, I kind of feel like a lost idiot.   I may be overthinking it, but I'd rather do it right and save myself the damage.  Thanks!

Ultramarathon,eflowb,Big races other than WSER and Hardrock,"As someone who just started running ultra's last year and have yet to qualify for these big races, I have been watching/reading commentary around the lotteries, it seems so far out of reach. Seems the goal of everyone who runs ultra's is to eventually run 1 or both of these races at least once but for those of us new to the sport and who are not fast enough to be considered elite, it seems the chances of *ever* running either race is becoming almost impossible. 

I am not saying it is not worth trying to qualify for those of us that are new, but with it being so unlikely it would seem wise to focus on some other big races as 'bucket list' races. I think it would even be cool to see some other races being elevated to similar status.
