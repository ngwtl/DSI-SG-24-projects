AdvancedRunning,straightfreshtodeath,Reasonable marathon goal after a 1:40 half?,"Hey all - I’m about to run my first marathon this Sunday, about a week after racing a half at 1:40. 

My half roughly went like this:
- first 5 miles at 8:00 pace
- next 6 miles at 7:40 pace
- next mile at 7:15 pace
- next mile at 6:30 pace
- last 0.1 at 6:00 pace

My legs currently feel good and pain-free.

I’m looking for answers to two questions: what’s a reasonable expectation for a marathon goal, and what’s a good strategy for pacing?

My training has been really haphazard - never really went more than 30 mpw, and my longest run was 16 miles at around 8:30 pace. But given the way I ran during the half, I feel like I might have more room to drop pace than I previously thought. Any tips here would be much appreciated - or I’d even love if you knock some sense into me.",1632438063
AdvancedRunning,SlowTwitchLion,Is 3:00 marathon realistic for me?,"I’m currently training to run the New York City Marathon. My goal is to one day qualify for Boston, I used to be pretty obese and i want to be able to say I went from Obese to BQ. Hopefully then, however I’d rather run a 3:05-3:10 then go for sub 3 and absolutely explode. My original plan was to try in December or January, but in July my dad got diagnosed with Lymphoma. So I decided to run New York and raise money for the Leukemia and lymphoma society. His last
treatment is the Friday before the race. I’m currently running between 70-75 miles a week. 

Previous 7 days going into this run was 64 miles. My previous marathon PR was 3:19

Monday I did 10
Tuesday was 16
Wednesday was also 10 
Thursday another 10 today, but I just got a pair of NB RC elites and wanted to see what they could do in a tempo run.


So what do you all think is New York the day to send it and BQ the same weekend my dad (hopefully beats cancer)

AdvancedRunning,OutsideFly,Straightening Pigeon-Toed Foot?,"Both of my feet are pretty pigeon-toed, but my left foot is really bad. I managed to alter my diet a bit, and started to cut abdominal cramping, but my runs are starting to get cut short due to some pains around my knees, especially my left knee. I would say I'm also a *little* x-legged. I have gone to the orthopedic and they didn't say much about my feet/knees. I am going again, but it's going to be a while until I have my appointment. My parents never put leg braces on me as a kid.

Has anyone managed to correct, or at least, help somewhat, pigeon-toed feet/legs as an adult? By this I mean my feet are turned inwards. I try to be conscious about it, but once I start running/day dreaming I forget. This is obviously going to make a lot of damage, especially to my knee cartilage but as of 2019 the knees okay. (Not sure what the 2021 x-ray will show, and I'm almost going to hit my 40s).

I've been trying to find some ankle/leg braces, but I'm not sure if anyone here has any recommendations especially as a runner. I am not sure if this also varies by sex, so just as a FYI I am female. Thank you.",1632426817
AdvancedRunning,eled34,Training Plan Advice - 6 weeks Until NYC Marathon,"Hi all,

I’ve been battling chronic calf issues in training for the NYC Marathon on 11/7. I had been at 30-35 mpw and ran a 1:44:30 HM 3 weeks ago. Then I reaggravated the strain and took 2 weeks at &lt;15mpw. This week, I was planning to return to 30+mi. While doing a threshold run this AM, I felt yet another minor twinge in my calf and cut the workout short immediately. I had planned to do a 2hr long run this weekend and to get 2-3 more 2hr+ runs in before the Marathon.

However, now I’m wondering how I should manage my training in light of the minor injury? My main goal is to finish the Marathon healthy (and ideally around 3:45-4hrs), but I wonder how much damage I’m doing if I am unable to get my training volume back to 30-40mpw for at least 1-2 weeks before the race?

Any guidance would be much appreciated!",1632424259

### Training

This is the first marathon I had ever run. The brief background of my running experience is I ran two seasons of XC and one season of track in high school to satisfy PE credits and get out of taking a PE class. I was moderately fast but didn't try very hard. Notable PRs were 5:11 or so for the mile and 2:10 or so for the half mile, and maybe a few high-18 5ks. 

I had not run consistently for at least 7 years or so, and in 2020 I was starting to get tired of being lazy and unfit, so I started running again. After injuring my knee, I picked up cycling for about 6 months. 

In late 2020 I made some new friends, one of which who ran casually and had run a marathon before. One day they were going out for an 11 mile easy run and I was bored so I asked them how fast they were running and if I could accompany them. The 11 mile run ended up being super fun and not as hard as I thought it would be. I then ran a virtual half-M with them with the goal of simply finishing it, and finishing it under 2 hours if I could - which I did. This was late 2020, and both inspired and solidified my desire to run a marathon.

So in february 2021, I signed up for the SF marathon and started to ""seriously"" train.

From the outset, I was aware that I wanted this to be a fun process, and knowing my own personality, I did not want to lock myself into a strict training plan and stop enjoying the running - so I didn't. My original goal was to simply finish the marathon in under 4 hours and enjoy the process. 

I continued to split my volume about evenly between cycling and running. I started getting much faster at running, and at some point I decided I wanted to actually race the marathon and do the best I could. I did not really have a goal in mind except to actually apply myself to the race. 

I started adding volume and very loosely following a Pfitz plan, but pretty much sticking to the rate of volume increase and skipping some of the workouts. 

In late March/early April, there was a period of time where the single workout I did every Saturday was a long fast run, pretty much a tempo run I guess, and for 3-4 Saturdays in a row I got faster and faster, eventually PRing my half marathon at about 1:32 or so. This was at a peak of about 50-60 MPW, I think I hit over 60MPW exactly one week this year


This was incredibly enticing and I decided my new goal was to run a 3 hour marathon. The marathon was originally scheduled for July at this time. 

However, not sticking religiously to a plan and not really knowing how to train myself effectively, I overtrained *several* different times. Shortly after that 1:32 half-M I experienced a minor knee injury that put me out for a week. I returned and tried to bump up the volume again, but a repetitive cycle of overtraining, collective fatigue, and minor injuries persisted throughout the summer and limited my volume. I don't think I hit over 50MPW again more than 2 or 3 times. 

The marathon also got postponed to September, which *really* killed my enthusiasm for a couple weeks. I had to extend my training another 8 weeks? I was going to miss the entire peak cycling season instead of just half of it? I was super bummed.

But I kept going. Nothing much interesting happened in the period between late May and September  except for that cycle of overtraining - which I eventually corrected for by just not running as much, usually mid 30s or 40s MPW. Sometimes zero miles, a couple weeks of all cycling, etc. 

I also contracted COVID (im vaccinated) in late August, about 4 weeks before the race. That put me out for yet another week, and I had 3 weeks to prepare for the race afterwards. I decide to say fuck it to a taper or easy period or whatever, and I ramped up *heavily* to basically try to make race day a sort of peak in a training plan. 

I was feeling nervous with 1 week to go. The Friday 9 days out from the race, I tried a workout I had seen on this sub: 20 miles with the first 10 miles easy and the second 10miles at marathon pace. after running 10 miles at mid-8 pace, I accelerated to sub-7 pace. This was *extremely* difficult, and I was only able to hold the pace for about 4-5 miles before completely blowing up and limping the last 5 miles home at a *weak* feeling high-8 or low-9 pace, with lots of walking and breaks. I only hit 19 miles, not the goal of 20. 

I was incredibly nervous after this and adjusted my goal to a 3:15 finish time and convinced myself I would be happy with it. I spent my last week relaxing - I did 2 easy 9 mile runs early in the week, 3 total rest days, and a *super* easy 4 mile run the day before the race



### Pre-race

The evening before, I carb loaded. I avoided any protein after lunch the day before as I knew that would lead to harder-to-plan bowel movements. I carb loaded by eating a bagel and a banana and drinking a Gatorade. Then I woke up at 3:30am, took a hot shower, ate a second bagel, and rode my bike to the race (3 miles across the city). Super happy they had a bike check. The bike served as a decent warm up. 

I ate a banana, did a quick .7 mile warm up but then I realized I was ""late"" to my wave and jetted over for the final bowel movement and then the start line. ""late"" because the race stated you could start in a later wave without needing to ask. 

### Race

When originally registering, I gave a ""planned"" finish time of 3:45. So that is about the speed of all the people I started with, combined with the fact that I was also slightly late, so everyone starting with me was running somewhere between. 3:30 to 4 hour race. 

My goal at this point was 3:15, but I started out WAY too fast owing to the excitement and adrenaline and the caffeinated Nuun I dropped in my pre-race Gatorade. I was running a high-6 or low-7 mile for the first 3-4 miles, weaving in and out of slower runners. I even heard two people comment as I ran by something like ""that guy went out way too fast"". 

But that's OK. I continued to feel absolutely *amazing*. the weather was perfect, I have always had a bit of competitiveness when training (disliking being passed on the bike and while running) and so passing people felt really good and splitting around people was actually kind of fun and distracting in a positive way. 

Coming across the Golden Gate Bridge back into the city, I hit the first half - just about 1:30 dead on. I felt *great* and the entire first half of the race I was envisioning my ""kick"" across the finish line (just like the old XC days) and mentally preparing to negative split the second half. I even called my mom, mid race on my AirPods, to tell her I was coming in faster than I expected. 

The next 5-6 miles felt *alright*. The amazing feeling declined, so slowly such that I did not really notice until around 15 or 16 that I had stopped feeling amazing and was no longer as mentally ""present"". This is what happens when I start running out of gas. I realized what was happening and decided to slow down to a low-to-mid 7 pace to recover as best I could, hoping that my kick the last mile or two could pull me out of that time debt. 

It wasn't to be. At mile 20 or so I pretty much blew up. Not completely, but the last 6 miles were torture, absolute torture. Around mile 21, I felt my right leg sort of spasm and pain go through my calf and hamstring - I was briefly terrified at having to DNF, but I quickly slowed down and the next few steps were OK. However, anytime I pushed the effort, my right leg would spasm again, and I knew I was one bad stride away from completely pulling or tearing something and a moderate to major injury, so I had to baby my stride and right leg the last 5 miles. 

I continued to slow down, running high 7s or low- to mid-8s the rest of the race. Besides my leg, I was also ragged and totally out of energy. My form collapsed. 

With about one mile to go, I summoned some mental fortitude and told myself, fuck it you're going to kick anyway. So I kicked. I accelerated to the maximum pace I was able to sustain, something like 7:10. My form was terrible, I think I looked like a frantic zombie

Less than a quarter mile into this effort, my right leg told me nope, if you want a functional leg for the next month, you cannot physically do this, sorry. So I slowed down again. 


### Post-race

I nearly limped across the finish line. I was super disappointed with how I ran the last 6, but with a final time of 3:07:40, I was both extremely pleased and a little surprised that I held on to such a good time despite the tortuous last 6 miles. 


Thoughts: 

I came in the top 60 out of almost 3200 people. That was thrilling but truly surprising. I can only guess at two factors: either SF is just not a popular or competitive marathon, despite being in a major famous city, or that COVID and this race being one of the first to run ""post""-COVID means that attendance was low. I am simply surprised that I came in the top 2% and yet did not even qualify for Boston. Maybe I have incorrect impressions about how many people actually qualify for boston, not sure. 

This was a super hilly course. I don't think a flat course is a magic bullet that would take 10 minutes off my time and get me under 3, but I do think it would be worth at least a few minutes. 

Seemingly a LOT of runners don't know how to use downhills to their advantage. I passed so many people on the downhills by opening my stride and picking up my cadence. At the same time, I was only able to take advantage of the downhills for the first 15 miles or so, after that I became too tired to safely and effectively increase my pace down the hills. They still saved me energy, but it wasn't the same. Especially at mile 20-21, there was a couple big downhills that I could not take advantage of due to my right leg and exhaustion. 

I did pleasantly surprise myself and push up the hills strategically and effectively by keeping my perceived exertion about the same, letting up on my pace for the 1-2 miles before large hills (I am intimately familiar with the course having spent a lot of time running major sections), and using the mile or two after hills (or the downhills) to recover and slowly bring my pace back up. 

For the last few months I knew that my inconsistent sort of YOLO training style would be my major limiting factor. I am now fairly confident that I know how to improve in the future and I am confident that if I ran another marathon in 6 months, I would be able to hit sub-3, even the same course. Besides a lack of general consistency, volume and long runs were major holes in my training. The longest runs I regularly ran were 15 or 16 miles runs with some marathon pace sprinkled throughout. I ran more than 16 miles maybe one or two times, with one of them being that awful 20 mile indicator run 9 days before the race. If I can successfully, and more slowly, increase my volume and incorporate more long runs, I think I can hit a sub-3. I also need to incorporate strength training into my routine somehow. 



When will my next marathon be? I don't honestly know. I know I am not done with them. I would love to sign up for the Big Sur marathon but I really want to get back to cycling and unfortunately I have unchangeable plans that weekend. 

I also know it won't be very soon. I have a loose desire to get into triathlons, so I need to see if/how that plays out. Maybe I will try a cycling race of some kind. With what I consider a year of ""serious"" endurance training under my belt (serious to me personally meaning I do it 5-6 days a week and its a big component of my life) I still feel very new and that there is a huge world of possibilities ahead of me. I enjoy being a fast runner, but when all I do is run, and without a near goal, it becomes unenjoyable and somewhat like a chore, so that is an issue I need to identify a solution to. Maybe more races, maybe different kinds of exercise, maybe I just need to summon motivation to take it up a notch.

AdvancedRunning,Nervous-Lobster1844,Modified Pfitz 18/55 taper,"I’m in the final weeks of training for the Chicago marathon where I’ve been following a modified version of Pfitz 18/55. What this primarily means is:

1. I usually run an easy 5-7 miles on the second rest day.
2. I’ve been doing an extra 2-4 hours of cross training most weeks as doubles (swimming and biking).

This means my peak weeks mileage wise are \~60, and hours wise \~10 hours of aerobic training (not necessarily the same weeks).

Now that I’m starting to taper and I've dropped the cross training, the mileage drop almost seems like too much. This is partially because I'm not used to running less than 6 days a week, so the second to last week with 3 rest days worries me. Should I continue to do easy runs on the rest days, or should I just follow the taper as stated and trust that an extra easy run or two won’t really be doing anything? 

Additional context: Most recent PR is a 1:26 half for the tuneup race 4 weeks out. Goal for Chicago is sub 3, but I have no expectations considering this will be my first marathon. Been running for 2 years, averaging an unstructured 35-60 mpw year round with a few 70 mile weeks thrown in. This cycle was my first extended period of structured running, and thus my first taper, so apologies if this is a dumb question.

## Training

This was my second race of the year since covid had shut all my races down and then got a minor Achilles international tendinitis injury in my right heel. Originally at the beginning of the year i was going to try to get a few trail races in but because of the heel issue my coach, PT and i decided to just run flat easy equestrian trail and road runs with no workouts, hills or strides. No speed work for most of the year with just easy runs and occasionally skipping a long run while doing my PT. During this phase of running i would average 50-70 mpw with long runs around 2 hours that would usually be about 14-18 miles long. This base work went on until the end of July when heel pain finally got under control and we began to transition to marathon specific training.

Marathon training started at the beginning of August, my goal race is CIM and with the history of my heel injury we are being pretty cautious as far as workouts go. I do one workout a week unless its a recovery week after a race and a faster long run of 17-20 miles with 4x30 second strides 2 times a week. My weekly mileage jumps around a lot going from 50-90 mpw in order to still hit high mileage weeks but still have time to recover and make sure i don't find myself in a bad situation. My weekly mileage progression so far has been 70, 80, 90, 60 (10 mile tune up race), 70, 80 and 50 (the week of the SF half).

My running schedule for this week was pretty easy in preparation for the SF half. 

Monday i took off as i usually run 6 days a week.

Tuesday 16x400 at 80 seconds, 200 meters rest with strides and drills in the warm up, this workout was pretty easy and i felt really relaxed, almost felt like i could just keep running 400s all day. 

paces: 1:17, 1:20, 1:21, 1:20, 1:20, 1:20, 1:19, 1:19, 1:20, 1:20, 1:19, 1:20, 1:19, 1:18, 1:18, 1:18

Wednesday 10 miles easy.

Thursday 8 miles easy.

Friday 6 miles easy.

Saturday 5.8 miles easy mostly on dirt.

Sunday RACE!

## Pre-race

This is where things start to get a little interesting, the race directors changed the course on us and i don't think it was for the better. The SF marathon usually put on 2 half marathons, an early one that runs along the first half of the marathon course and a 2nd faster (as in competition) USATF certified one that runs along the 2nd half of the marathon course. This year the starting line was supposed to be at the Presidio which was perfect because my buddy who was running it also lived right around there, we would have been able to walk to the starting line. Well they combined the two races into one that starts at the Ferry Building on the other side of SF instead. 

The day before the race i drive to my buddy's, i live an hour away from the city so we were going to get dinner and then get to sleep so the morning of the race i wouldn't have to get up so early and drive that far. We are out at dinner in Japantown getting some good ramen, my pre-race secret is pho or ramen because it sits well and has plenty of sodium. All the sudden i realize, i had forgotten my bib sitting on my couch at home! I quickly email the race helpline to see if i could get a new bib in the morning but they didn't reply until early in the morning so i decided to just suck it up and drive back home and grab it, an extra 2 hours of driving the day before an important race i didn't need to do.

The morning of the race everything starts off well, conveniently woke up 10 minutes before my alarm went off so getting up was easy. I eat my instant oatmeal, maple and brown sugar flavor from Trader Joe's and then look at Uber rides to the Ferry Building and it was a whopping $50! We decide to drive instead, what a bad idea that was, no parking anywhere! We are running out of time and getting further and further from the starting line. Finally we find a spot, its about a mile from the start and we have 25 minutes until the start of the race, good thing i decided to get my bib yesterday, no time to get a new one now. 

With the time crunch we decide to take off our sweats and just run to the starting line for our warm up. We decided it would be better to save the time and not deal with the gear check since the weather was so nice anyway. We are a little frazzled and in the rush i forget my running hat in the car, that's fine i will run without it and deal with the sweat in my eyes. About 13 minutes later and a little over a mile we find the starting line and get ourselves situated, getting close to about 10 minutes to the start of the race now. 

I go up to where the start is and jump the divider to get up with the other top runners. I have time to settle in, get a few strides in and take my one GU before the race starts. A little unconventional but everything actually couldn't have worked out better. Even though i have a lot of anxiety i somehow don't stress about races, except this time because everything that could go wrong was going wrong, up until this point at least. I was finally able to relax and get into the zone for my race that was about to start.

## Race

I'm a few people back from the starting line and we all get ready for the start, they tell us to go, nothing spectacular, no gun, no annoying noise from a bull horn or any of that for this race i guess. My plan is to go the first mile at 6 to 5:50 pace and then settle in to a comfortable pace a little faster than that, the last race i ran i got pulled into running too fast with some guys that were trying to break 50 in 10 mile race. Didn't want to do that again. I manage to adjust my effort and my watch beeps 5:51, perfect! I start catching a lot of people that went out a little too hard that first mile that are trying to get into there correct pace, this is where i settle into low 5:40s. There was a group of about 5 runners maybe 50 to 25 meters in front of me for the next 4 miles and i was stuck in no mans land. I didn't want to push my pace this early in the race to catch up to them but i really wanted to be in their pack but i just kept my pace and didn't let them out of my sight, i had a feeling i would get my chance to catch them.

Coming up on mile 6 the pack of runners i had in my sights on for so long finally began to falter, as they started to string out as we came around a hair pin turn under the Golden gate bridge i started to pick them off one by one and it felt so good to power past them. I think this is why i ran so well this mile getting 5:37 despite the sharp hairpin turn we had. The first half of the race was nearly as flat as a pancake but the second part started off with one beast of a hill and i found myself at the foot of it feeling powerful. The remnants of the pack i had just caught, the lead woman with her lead bike entourage and two guys, were still in front of me and they were now in my domain. I have always been comparatively good at running up hills and the path we were on was packed cinder just like the equestrian trails i have been running all year. Looking at the grade adjusted paces i ran the equivalent of a 5:33 and it paid off because of the lead i had gotten on everyone.

The rest of the race was down hill from here, literally. We dropped elevation just as fast as we gained it. I eased back a little to regain some of the energy i had used to get my lead on the group, but still did not want them to catch me. After recovering a bit and protecting myself from the pounding of cruising down the hill it started to flatten out and i opened up my stride to take advantage of it managing to snag an easy 5:30 with just 4 more nearly flat miles left.

After spending the first half the race in no mans land with a group of runners just out of reach i now found myself in no mans land AGAIN with a strung out group i knew must have been hot on my heels. The next few miles were actually pretty nice and are the highlight of the race for me, it was nice and flat, i still felt good and was again cruising at 5:45 pace with the rest of the half marathon runners cheering me on as they were running the other direction because we were doubling back on the same route now. The sun was blinding me at this point too, sure could have used that hat i had forgotten. It seemed to work out fine though, because of squinting into the sun, i felt like i had the biggest shit eating grin on just like Eliud Kipchoge at the end of his races.

This is where the race started to get a little interesting in mile 11, they had us cut right through the slower runners to go straight up a little hill in a park. I nearly ran into an unsuspecting lady just cruising along for her race. This started to through me off from my grove i was in especially because i was starting to enter the end of race pain cave. To have the two of us nearly collide messing up our strides to then try and power up a small hill which mite as well have been Everest kind of messed me up and i tried to get back into the swing of things but was the beginning of my slowest miles in the race. The next mile was not that much better, it was poorly marked and because i was still in no mans land i couldn't just follow the leader, i had doubt at times of if i was going the right way and this was mile 12, another really important mile to usually just hunker down and push with out worrying if you were going off course or not. This mile was again tied for my slowest with the last one i had just ran. 

This last mile i was going to get back on track and run a fast finishing mile. At this point i had no doubts i was running the right course, i could tell because all of the last of the 5000 runners were all over the place and i was like a salmon swimming up stream to get through them. One of the runners even shoulder checked me but that wasn't going to stop me from getting to that finish line as i swerved and weaved through the horde at a 5:47 mile pace. What had happened was the runners were ignoring the cones in the middle of the road. I discovered the right hand side had less runners and ran there for a bit and then transitioned to the left again where i was originally supposed to be because it cleared out again. 

Time for the kick of eternity, just shy of a mile of perfectly straight road swerving through a crowd of confused runners. But i can see the clock, and i realize i'm not going to break 16, but HOLLY HELL! I'm about to PR by almost 3 minutes!!!

## Post-race

Finishing the race finally felt good and seeing my coach just after the finish line i walked up to him and we shared a bit about how the race went. This is when i header that some of the top finishers were lead the wrong way because the lead bike got lost. Could i have gotten lost too and this was why the course was so confusing the last few miles? My GPS said something like 13.14 miles but being this close to the city with the tall buildings it could be off. 

I hung out in the finishing coral a bit longer grabbing my medal, a photo and a bottle of water. By this time the group of runners that i had passed back at the hill started to finish. I saw the lead woman that i had passed on the hill and wanted to congratulate here for winning. This is when i learned about her lead bikers taking them down an interesting path as well. 

I meandered out of the coral and jumped over the divider again to get to where my coach was sooner and so i could watch the finish line. I had a few friends still in the race and wanted to watch them finish. My friend who also has the same coach was now finishing up and when she got to us told us about the messed up course also. She had about 13.47 miles on here GPS. 

Looking at the course map for the race it looks like i did run the right path and didn't cut it short but the race was poorly marked in the section going along the Aquatic park. I just got lucky that the people in front of me went the right way and i followed them. Everyone else was taken the wrong way by the lead bikers and ended up running nearly a third of a mile too far. This was a very frustrating finish to an otherwise amazing race, if i had more confidence in the course i could have pushed the end harder and easily broken 1:16 especially if it were not for fighting up a stream of other runners running the other direction and having that encounter with the guy who solder checked me. Everyone else that was lead the wrong way could have run 1-2 minutes faster depending on how much longer the course actually was for them.

All in all i am very happy with my performance given what i had to go through but i am not sure if i will be running another SF marathon race or the one they put on in Berkeley. I hope my next race in just over a month i am able to finally snag that 1:15 that i want this time.

AdvancedRunning,4thwave4father,Some Observations from the Sweat Elite Videos,"Who else has been watching the great training videos coming out of the Sweat Elite YouTube channel? As an amateur runner, it is fascinating to see how the pros are training, for me especially the marathoners, and to hear from their coaches as to why they train the way they do. Some of my main takeaways from the more recent marathon-focused videos are below:

1. It seems like most of these runners tend to do threshold work as intervals rather than longer tempo runs. For example the 1k repeats near HM pace or the 3 x 1 mile at HM pace that are featured in a few of the videos. Coming from the background of doing the Pfitz plans multiple times, where you are prescribed 4-7 mile tempos run at a steady pace, I found this approach interesting. 
2. I wish that I had bottle service in a marathon. It would be so much easier to have bottles with calories that I could grab at prescribed points and toss rather than having to worry about carrying or taking gels. I would also prefer liquid calories to gels, but that's not really possible unless you want to carry a bottle the whole way.
3. Having a coach to program your workout, provide feedback in real time (during the run on big workouts), carry your bottles, and help you to adjust training as you go must be really nice. Hopefully this doesn't come across as jealous, I think it is pretty cool and cool to watch!

Any other observations?",1632331309

### Training

As I mentioned in my pre-race post during my tempo jitters, I have been training very well over the past 2 years, steadily increasing my mileage to an average of 60 mpw over this year and peaking this cycle at an 80 mile week.  I raced a half this spring in 1:24 and was eager to see all that work pay off in the full.  I had no injuries this year and never missed a workout or a long run.  Overall, as solid of a training block as one could expect.

### Pre-race

We arrived at the hotel near the start/finish on Saturday afternoon.  Already had race bibs in hand.  Mostly stayed off my feet that day and relaxed.  Tried to sleep but without a lot of success.  Got to the start in plenty of time and had a chance to do a short jog to get the legs moving.

### Race

Although I hit the halfway point on schedule for a sub 3 hour finish, I should've recognized then that it wasn't in the cards and lived to fight another day.  The humidity felt high and the temps were already about 70.  I didn't realize it until the second loop of the 2 loop course, but I had also already spent some time running into a headwind coming off the ocean.  

As my splits clearly show, it didn't take long after passing the halfway point that it all started to fall apart.  I just couldn't keep it moving.  I haven't felt this bad in a race in a long time.  Had it been a local race that I hadn't traveled to and gotten a hotel for, etc., I might've considered my options but I soldered on.  The last 8-10 miles were miserable.  More demoralizing was the fact that the course seemed to measure a quarter mile long, meaning I had an extra .25 miles to think about what went wrong.

Overall, I pulled in at 3:24 which was somehow good for 20th place overall and 3rd in my age group, but far far away from the sub 3 or BQ dreams of a week ago.

### Post-race

So now I sit on vacation for a week, legs already no longer sore and my nerves telling me to get myself moving again, contemplating my next move.  My former coach checked in on me and is urging me to consider this a long training run and take another swing at a BQ effort in 4-8 weeks under better conditions.  I want her to be right and I really feel like all the indicators told me that I was in better shape than 3:24.  I'm going to get some running shoes on during this trip and think it over.  20th overall suggests that most people struggled and I'm not kidding myself with all the weather excuses, but who knows.  One this is for sure, it's been a very long time since I've been this confused with a race result.

AdvancedRunning,adamm_96,Pfitz 18/55 or 12/55,"Signed up for a marathon on Feb 12th, so 20 weeks out.  I'm shooting for 3:15 based on my current fitness which is a 1:31 HM.  

My base:

* Past 6 weeks, I have averaged 40 mpw and following the general structure of Pfitz with a \~10 mile medium-long run during the week and a \~13 mile weekend long run.
* Previous 16 weeks before that, I have averaged 35 mpw with one threshold every week, and one interval workout on half of the weeks.

Question: should I continue to build up my base and do the 12/55 plan starting at the end of November, or is my base already good enough to jump in to 18/55 in two weeks? It looks like the 12 week plan ramps up quicker in the first few weeks compared to the 18 week plan, but both have a few weeks at the start that are below the mileage I'm currently doing.  Thanks!

AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Workout of the Week - Floating Fartleks,"Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent  specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas:

* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Floating Fartleks**.

*History:*

From two-time Olympian, and Australian 10,000m record holder, Ben St Lawrence. He is the co-founder and coach of Run Crew, a coaching group and racing team.

*Why:*

This session is great at helping you to become comfortable with being uncomfortable, and that’s essentially what running is all about, right? This mix of hard efforts, with ‘floats’ where you back off the gas but not too much is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to train your body and mind to pick things up even when your body is screaming at you to slow down. The temptation to back off a little on the efforts, or to reduce the float to a jog is always there, but by quieting this little voice and pushing through, you’re getting invaluable practice for the toughest point of the race, the last mile. When the questions start to be asked of you, you will have been to this point (physically and mentally) many times in practice and be able to tell yourself, “I’ve got this!”.

*What:*

* 15 – 20 min easy jog.

* 20 min of fartlek, going 2 min fast (about current 10k effort), 1 min float (just backing off the gas a little, but not too much, approx 30 sec/km slower than your 10km effort), 1 min fast (about current 5k effort or slightly faster), 30 sec float (same as first float). Repeat this for 20 min, finishing with a 2 min effort.

* Jog for 2 min (jog, not float) then run at tempo pace (approx Marathon effort) for 8 min – making the whole workout 30 minutes long.

* 15 – 20 min of easy jogging.

*How:*

There are a few gear changes throughout the session, and no time to really switch off, as long as you keep the floats honest (easier said than done!). The first few efforts feel great, but as the minutes start to tick by, the float recoveries (particularly the 30 sec after a fast 60 sec effort) start to seem shorter and shorter. Regardless of how fatigued you’re feeling, when the watch beeps you’ll find that extra gear and manage to hold on just long enough. You’re teaching yourself that even when every bit of feedback you’re getting is that you need to slow down (or at best, maintain pace) you CAN pick it up again. Even if you mess it up a little and go too hard on one of the efforts, the lessons learned will help you to get more closely dialled in to exactly where your limits are and how that should feel.

AdvancedRunning,soberfeministkilljoi,Determining Race Pace,"How do you go about determining your fitness level and race pace prior to your marathon?

I have been using a sub 3:30 marathon training plan this cycle. I have been mostly hitting the paces as prescribed, but I will say that the heat and humidity have done me in a few times. (I probably should’ve been adjusting my paces, but too little too late now.) I thought about doing a test race to gauge my fitness, but any race at this point would be on tired legs from the training, so can that even be used to gauge fitness for marathon pace?",1632316474
AdvancedRunning,Low_Society,Smart ways of increasing weekly milage,"Hi All,

I've been holding 75-80 km (46-50 miles) per week for several months now and am looking to increase my weekly mileage, but not sure which method would work best.

For context, ran a 17:20 5k earlier this year, not training for anything in particular in the near future as all races have been cancelled due to covid : (

**Weekly Schedule**

M: Rest

T: Tempo workout, warm up and cool down included, total 16km (10miles)

W: Easy 11km (6.8miles)

T: Easy 11km (6.8miles) + strides

F: Threshold/ speed work, warm up and cool down included, total 10km (6.8miles)

S: Easy 11km (6.8miles)

S: Long run 22km (13.6miles)

Ideally (ignoring time restraints etc) to increase my overall weekly mileage should I;

1. Remove my rest day and start with 5km and slowly build up
2. Do a mid week long run of 16km (10miles)
3. Add 2-3km to each of my easy days
4. Double on a day, would this be a workout day or easy day

AdvancedRunning,michaelmf,Help dealing with a sudden loss of fitness,"Through the winter/early spring, I was running about 35-45KM per week, including weekly long runs of about 20KM and interval workouts like (5X1KM at 3:45/KM). I run with a chest strap - The Strava Elevate extension gave me run scores of high 50s to low 60s on my runs. I was also doing a lot of road biking at this time.

At the beginning of May, I suddenly lost the ability to run.

In the span of a week or two, I went from being able to comfortably run a half marathon to barely being able to run 5KM.

The symptoms are that my body just feels completely awful and drained, a highly elevated heart rate and various sensations in my chest.

After taking about one month off trying to recover, I've tried to run around one slow 5KM run per week to see if my body has made any progress. I try to run at a 5:30/KM pace but it usually ends up closer to 5:45. Prior to all this, I would run this route with an avg heart rate of high 140s. Now, its in the 160s.

A few times, I couldn't make the entire 5KM but most times I could, it just really sucked. My run scores during this period went from mid 50s to low 50s to high 40s to low 50s and eventually back to mid 50s. At the beginning of September, I got sick for a few days (not Covid) and the run  scores went back down to low 50s. The run scores mostly match my subjective experience of the discomfort during the run.

During this time, I also stopped intense cycling. I found I could continue to ride if I kept my heart rate below 150BPM. If i did this, I could slowly and casually ride distances of around 75KM.

Without running in my schedule, I also took up swimming as a replacement which seems to be okay (I swim incredibly slow and casually).

I've met with my doctor many times and unfortunately am completely at a loss for what's going on here:

Things I've tried that hasn't helped/shown anything:

- anti-histamines

- puffer

- bloodtest

- EKG scan

- Chest x-ray

- blood pressure

As far as I know, I've never had Covid. I also took a covid antibody test that showed I didn't have Covid.

I've been hoping to see an internal medicine expert since June but my appointment hasn't even been scheduled yet.

Has anyone experienced something similar to this?

Does anyone have any thoughts on what could be causing all this?

Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions on things I could test/that may help my situation?

My Garmin predicts a 2:56 (which I’m certain will kill me) as others go as high as a 3:40 prediction. 

I’m peaking on my training of 43 miles this week with my second 20 mile training this weekend. I’ve used Hal Higdon’s Intermediate 2 plan and added intervals in to add some intensity. Per Hal’s recommendation I don’t run the long ones hard. The last 20 miler, I did at an 8-min mile pace and felt comfortable. 

In May, I ran a 1:32 half and did 19:52 5K the same month. This is only my second marathon so I don’t have much to go off of. My previous marathon was two years ago at 3:38 but I hadn’t put in the proper training miles, never had done any speed workouts and wasn’t as prepared as I am now. 

I was hoping that some with more experience might be able to share some insight. I’m 41M if that matters.

**Training**

Having taken up running a little over 18 months ago to lose weight and become more active, this would be my first race. I was due to compete in a half marathon in June but it has since been rescheduled to October due to Covid restrictions. Coming into the race my training was averaging around 30-40km per week but was relatively inconsistent, by the weekend of the race I’d kept this up for around 5/6 weeks, with much of the summer before that being lucky to get anything more than 2 training runs in per week due to work fatigue and the rescheduled races lowering my motivation.

I had run a 39:23 in the Spring on a GPS based time trial along a straight/flat course so this was my A goal. I felt that I probably wasn't in as good shape as I was then, but hopeful the occasion, crowds and other runners would help me along.

Generally, due to my relatively low mileage and the fact I was targeting HM’s, I’ve tried to include a decent amount of threshold work at HM pace to maximise the quality of my training. Usually I’ll try and do a 2hr long run per week, but this has not been entirely consistent.

I had a couple of Half Marathons coming up after this 10k and so didn’t really want to taper to any great extent as my focus was really on getting a sub 1:30 HM at either/both of those events. For some unexplainable reason on the Wednesday before the race I decided to go out and run 39k at around 5:00/km pace. I have absolutely no idea what was going through my head, I stepped out the front door for an easy long run and got completely carried away and had almost run a marathon distance. I suppose I reasoned that it would all be good training for the HM’s, what I stupidly hadn’t thought about is just how badly it would tire my legs for the weekends 10k! Suffice to say that my legs were not in good shape at all in the lead up to the race, I had a 30 min massage on the Friday evening as a bit of a last resort but I was convinced that I’d be even lucky to dip under 40 minutes.

**Pre-Race**

Given how my legs felt and the fact I felt a PB was unlikely, I was incredibly relaxed heading into the race. All the pressure was off. I had a large bowl of pasta the night before and even stayed up until midnight to watch Raducanu win the US Open and all the post show etc. I hadn’t really told anyone about the details of the race and just wanted to run it for myself, this was a really nice head space to be in.

Alarm went at 6am, had my standard morning run breakfast of a little porridge, banana and coffee and slowly got ready. On my jog down to the park where the start was my legs actually felt \*okay\*. The starting area and route as a whole was entirely around the area of the city that I had been running day in day out for the last year, it all just felt so familiar and calm. I’d probably arrived a little too early though and ended up having almost an hour to wait around before the start. I did some drills and completed my warm up just generally tried to be mindful and take in the amazing atmosphere of my first race. Eventually the time had come to head to the start line. The fastest corral was sub 50 mins and so I knew I needed to be at least a half decent way into the pack to avoid having to run through just under 50min runners early on.

**Race**

Apparently I hadn’t been quite as quick in getting towards the front of the pack for the start as the first 200m involved a bit of jostling and nipping in-between slower runners to get to my pace. Being my first race I wasn’t exactly sure of the etiquette but made sure to give as much space as possible when passing, but I probably looked a little erratic trying to nip in and find spaces to pass! Eventually I settled in with a small group. The first KM was completed in 3:47, ludicrous pace I thought. ‘Don’t go out too fast, don’t blow up’ kept going through my head. I decided to ease off and dropped to a 3:49 2nd KM and 3:54 for the 3rd and 4th. I felt great, the crowds, the familiar roads and the beautiful weather felt like they were worth another 10s/KM to me. I realised I was going to run close to my 5k PB yet still felt I had a lot more to give.

I decided to roll the dice and trust my legs. 5th KM was 3:46 to bring me to 19:08 for the first 5k, this was uncharted territory and my mindset was to stick at that pace for as long as I could. KMs 6-8 were all completed in similar splits. By the 9th KM I was aware that I was operating at my limit and the temperature had started to climb. 9th KM was done in 3:55 and I didn’t think I had anything left for the last KM, I knew I was on for a PB though and so really dug in. It was at this point a group of 2/3 runners caught me and I made the decision to use them and try to go at their pace for the last KM. With my HR pretty much at max I completed the last KM in 3:38 and finished a couple of seconds ahead of the group that had caught me.

Chip time was 38:08 resulting in a negative split for the race, seeing the last 5k completed in 19:00.

**Post-race thoughts**

Wow, just wow. I can’t believe it took me so long to get into running. I’ve never experienced an atmosphere like that where I am actually a participant. Consider me hooked. A big thanks to all the organisers and volunteers, you could really tell that everyone was so pleased for the return of races after Covid. I relaxed on the beach for a little while before gently jogging home, grabbing a shower and then heading back to the course to support a friend who was competing in the Marathon event proper.

What is clear is that I need to be much more regimented with my training, or at least get some more consistency. Ideally not doing things like destroying your legs 4 days before a race etc! What was encouraging though is just how much residual fitness I’d seemingly retained throughout quite an inactive summer. I have joined a local running club and will try to attend at least one session per week there, with the rest of my mileage being done on my own, but to a plan rather than just what I feel like on the day. I think that 10KM - HM distance is going to be my area of focus over the coming year.

I do wonder that if my legs had been a little fresher could I have dipped into the 37:xx? I think to speculate on that though would be a little greedy, 38:08 was already wildly beyond what I had expected before the race.

Using the Jack Daniels running calculator a 38:08 would suggest a sub 1:30 HM is easily possible, in fact it comes out at an equivalent of sub 1:25, of course this assumes good conditions and that I have the mileage in my legs to run that time. I’m not so sure about that and so my goal is still to run sub 1:30, enjoy the occasion and bank my first HM.",1632228226

### Training
I basically spent the last couple months challenging myself to up my mileage drastically. Recently sober from weed, I had run [some PRs in shorter distances](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ose2zy/choosing_a_target_marathon_time_after_two_new_prs/) that really raised my confidence. At the time I was running like 50-60 mile weeks and feeling ok about my progress but also feeling like I should be capable of more. Around that time I saw a viral video of a pregnant Makenna Myler running around the same monthly mileage as me (250mi) and it kind of lit a fire under my ass. This might not sound very PC or kind, but I thought that if a pregnant woman (albeit a pro) can match my mileage then I'm probably capable of going much harder...

The very next week I upped my mileage from 63mi to 103mi on 6 days/week with no doubles (dumb and reckless, I know) and some how managed to not injure myself. The next week, I approached things a bit smarter and did 115mi with doubles. The week after I added workouts while keeping my easy days about 8:15-8:30/mi. I ended August with slightly over 460 miles of running. 

By early September, some of my easy runs had average heart rate readings barely in zone 2, with a fair chunk of time in zone 1. The fitness boost from the mileage was almost immediate and obvious. My main goal was just to prevent any single run from killing my legs and it seemed to work. I had several workouts with 2x3mi, 3x2mi or a straight 10km @ half marathon pace (6:20-6:30/mi) sandwiched in middle distance runs and in some cases my long runs. Most of these were done in 80F+ degrees and felt awful which shook my confidence a bit. 

Pre-race week I tapered slightly from 103mi to 90mi, then just 30mi in the days leading up to the Friday race.

### Pre-race
My legs felt ready, but I was super nervous as this was just my second half marathon ever. I ran 5km to the race for a warm up and noticed my easy run heart rate was much higher than normal which I definitely fixated on too much. I took a caffeinated gel with beet root juice before the warm up, and another gel 30 min prior to the gun. Plenty of water all day. Since this was a night race starting at 7:30pm, it was beginning to get dark and I had been obsessing a bit about the race all day.

### Race
It was a small field, since this was just a smaller, local half marathon. There were about 50-60 of us registered I think. Based on past results, I knew my projected time would place me in the top 10 at least. Immediately in the first mile, I noticed that I was in the lead pack, with the top guy looking to be around at 6 min per mile pace. Out of lack of experience, I found myself following one guy who appeared to be at 6:30 pace and stuck by him until the 2 mile split. When I noticed we had slowed to 6:40, I consciously sped up a bit and eventually passed him. I caught up to the 3rd place guy about half a mile later and stuck by him until he too started to slow around mile 8 where I noticed we had slowed to over 6:30 pace.

By this point, it was very dark out and the race had moved to an off road packed dirt and gravel trail from mile 3 until mile 13. I had a light on my flip belt and that gave me just enough visibility to see 5-8ft in front of me. After passing the last guy and taking what I later realized was 3rd place, I was running a smoother, faster pace and settled into a rhythm where it felt like I was getting tunnel vision from the lack of visibility and dimly lit path in front of me. The run didn't quite feel difficult until about mile 11. 

The entire race I was terrified of hitting a physical wall from leg fatigue which never really came. Around miles 8-10 that feeling turned into confidence when I realized it probably wouldn't happen. I had enough energy to kick the last stretch well under 6min/mi and finish strong. I crossed the line feeling like I could've kept going. Maybe I sandbagged my time estimate? But I hit my goal and felt great about it. 

### Post-race
The winner finished in about 1:20:00, it wasn't exactly a race with any super fast people in it but I was really happy with my top 3 finish (2nd in age group). It felt like my high mileage training + workouts done in the summer heat helped me a ton when racing at a much cooler temperature at night. Most of my workouts were far more mentally difficult than this race and I think the preparation showed. In a morning + road half marathon, I think I can do even better at my current fitness level. 

### What's next?
Sub 1:25:00 was the milestone I was hoping for on the road to a sub 3 hr marathon. My marathon is scheduled for March in Napa Valley so I have plenty of time to continue building my aerobic fitness with triple digit mileage weeks before starting a structured marathon plan. After this race, I'm feeling far less doubt about running sub 3. If only a month and a half of really high mileage can produce results like these, I'm feeling really good about my chances with several months of time to prepare.",1632188696

AdvancedRunning,piratepilates,LetsRun.com uses the memory of Norm Macdonald to score points against intersex athletes,"This is just disgusting. 

Known internet troll and co founder of LetsRun, Robert Johnson, wrote an op Ed today on LetsRun linking a quote of Norm Macdonald’s about sprinters as proof that Norm would agreed with Robert about intersex athletes.

Norm’s quote: “i feel that one of the basic requirements of being a sprinter is having legs.”

Robert Johnson even goes so far as to pretend that Norm joked about intersex athletes instead of sprinters:

“Imagine for a moment that instead of talking about Pistorius, Macdonald was talking about an intersex or transgender athlete and said the following:

“Let’s imagine you are an elite women’s athlete…and then you go home and say to your partner, “Oh I lost, honey.”

“Who’d you lose to?”

“The girl with functioning testes.”

That seems pretty ridiculous, right?”

Will be running NYC in 7 weeks. Want to go sub 2:45 there. Hoping a bit more training, sea level course, and more runners to work with at my goal pace will help me take 5 minutes off.

Feeling pretty good today, went for a slow 5k and muscles are sore but no noticeable injuries. I ran a 110km ultra in mid August that I bounced back from relatively easily so optimistic about my ability to get back into training next week after some easy miles this week.

# Training

I had done one marathon before (Berlin, 2018) and many half-marathons. While my half-marathon PR is good (1:24), I have never properly trained before and this showed in Berlin: I showed up injured and very under-trained, but still managed to pull 3:39:52. This time, I was determined to do something different. I've looked at many plans in my time as a runner and am attracted to the intensity of Pfitz, but I knew I should stick to something that was more my level as I've never consistently run more than 35 miles per week except for a few weeks at a time.

I had planned to run the CIM last year, before it was canceled due to the pandemic, and had already downloaded their pre-made plan for intermediate runners. It seemed comfortably within my skill level and would be an opportunity to introduce speedwork, which I don't generally do, alongside some runs that seemed well within my ability to handle. It wasn't the most ambitious, but it seemed doable and I ultimately wanted this race to be an acknowledgment of the reality of my running ability (including the time I have to prepare) and not a repeat of my previous efforts, which are more characterized by my wishful thinking about what I know I ultimately have the capacity to do but don't have the time to properly build up to. The theme of this race and its preparation, for me, was slow and steady wins the race. I wanted to stay in my lane, be consistent, not get injured, and make it to the finish line feeling nowhere near as defeated as during my last marathon.

Another factor in my decision to choose a training plan that didn't push me as much was that I moved around 4 weeks into my training from a cool, hilly, rainy place much like San Francisco to a place that was extremely hot, humid, and flat. I knew the key to making it through this race, given the completely different conditions, would be to stick to the plan as much as possible and so picking something that was a stretch or a challenge would be a recipe for failure. 

Ultimately, I mostly kept to the plan except with regards to the speedwork. I am not a morning runner and, where I was, even waking up early to run hardly improved the conditions. About halfway through the plan I stopped sticking religiously to the speedwork prescribed and instead picked a few exercises that I liked (mostly ones involved 3-4 mins of 10k pace alternated with easy paces) and could maintain in the heat without feeling like I was going to expire in the road. My main goal was to keep up with the volume, which averaged around 35 miles per week and peaked around 45. I was mostly able to do this, although I got sick towards the end of training and had to shift my 20 mile run out by a week, meaning I missed the last 16-miler of my plan. In the three weeks before the race, I only ran a few times because life got in the way. Still, I was hopeful that the increase in efficiency I would gain from not running in 85+ degree, humid weather would help me be consistent. 

# Pre-Race

I woke up long before my alarm - no surprise there. I had a small breakfast of Grape Nuts and peanut butter, did some SAM warmups, and went with my family to find the start. The previous day I'd had a mild panic about my nutrition plan for the race - I'd only purchased an energy bar and two gel packs because I could fit only that in my pockets. At the last minute, I decided to put all of that in my running backpack alongside my phone and a banana I grabbed from the hotel lobby out of paranoia that I would somehow miss the two GU stations that the marathon had in place.

The start was rather strange compared to the races that I'm used to. As I mentioned, I've only done Berlin before and the pre-race there is at least an hour long, with huge crowds and tightly-controlled corrals. I've also done half marathons and I'm used to a good deal more hullabaloo around the start. Perhaps it was a result of the pandemic-related accommodations, but the corrals were not coordinated at all and, by the time I arrived, it seemed like hardly anyone was running the marathon. Runners, in general, are an anxious bunch that like to jockey for position and so I was shocked that the corrals were almost empty until shortly before the race began. Only 3 minutes before the start, they announced that we should get to our corrals. I found my 3:30 pacer and got next to him. Because of corona, they released runners in waves of 5; still, I only left very shortly after the gun went off which surprised me as I am used to a long wait to get the elites and first waves out. This was a pleasant surprise - now the only question was to see if my hope that the lack of heat would help me attack hills I was completely untrained for would be proven true.

# Race

The race went more or less according to my wildest (realistic) hopes. A group of us attached ourselves to the 3:30 pacer very early on. While I had anticipated that the cooler weather would be a boon, I had totally failed to account for just how much energy I saved by not having to think about what I was doing. It was the first time I had ever bothered to stay with a pacer because I don't really need them for the half-marathon distance that I normally do. We went out fast, around 7:30/7:45 pace, and kept that up through the early, flat stages of the marathon. Our pacer was good about letting us know that he was doing this because of the hills we would face and also let us know that the course was officially unofficially 26.4 miles, so we needed to be a bit faster than what we might think if we were to hit our time. 

It was dark and our group was quiet - a couple of jocular guys would call out the height of each of the first couple of hills, but they fell out of our group fairly quickly. After a summer of running alone along the same track in the same place over and over again, it was extremely refreshing to be somewhere with great scenery and in a group of (quiet) like-minded runners. The crowd was (and remained for most of the race) relatively anemic. We saw especially few spectators at this early stage - mostly people out for early morning exercise and a few dedicated individuals bundled up warm against the cool morning. For the most part, though, our only company was each other and the gentle sounds of the sea beside us.

The sun began to rise just as we approached the Golden Gate Bridge and the 10k mark. Here, we slowed down drastically as the real hills began. This is where I ate my first gel and a banana I'd swiped from the hotel. From the Golden Gate Bridge onwards through mile 16, the course is more or less entirely rolling, steep hills. Staying with the pacer was crucial to my overall race. I have a bad tendency to try to attack hills and get to the top as quickly as possible, which would have been a disastrously ill-advised strategy for this race. I learned quite a lot about how to manage hills by staying with the pacer, who remained cheerful and lively throughout this difficult portion. He informed us that it was his third time pacing and that this was by far the hardest course. Apparently, they'd added 1300 feet of net elevation gain compared to previous years. Not sure if this is true or not, but it certainly made me feel more accomplished.

We rounded our way back to the Golden Gate Bridge and, while crossing back over it, reached the halfway mark at around 1:45. At this point, our group had thinned to around ten people. Here, I ate my second gel and the power bar. Shortly thereafter, at one of the aid stations with GU, I took a bag and consumed that as well. 

By the time we got through the hilly portion, around mile 16, there were only a couple of us left. I knew that I had to make a decision about whether or not to stay with the group as we were going a bit to slow for comfort. By mile 18, only me and the pacer were left of the original group (that I can remember) but a few new people had glommed on. 

At this point, I was consistently ahead of the pacer and comfortably uncomfortable. I decided to leave him behind in the interest of building up a buffer to definitely break 3:30:00. From this point onwards, I was more or less alone. I grabbed a final bag of GU snacks at the 20-mile mark and stopped trying to hold back. By this point, I knew that I would finish, but I was unsure if my decision to break away would deliver me the time that I wanted. I had started my running tracker a bit early, so the timing was off, but I wasn't sure by how much. On top of that, I had the pacer's warning in my mind that the course was a bit long. I decided to make a gamble: with the hills over, I was on more familiar territory. I'd trained flat and hot all summer and my body wasn't yet feeling as tired as it had been during some of my longer runs, especially the 20-milers. More than that, I was mentally much less exhausted than I was during my training because I hadn't had to focus on managing my water, nutrition, and route. I decided to give it everything I had and risk totally flaming out towards the end in the hope that I would make up the time I had lost and eke out a 3:30 finish. At the very least, in contrast to my previous marathon experience, which ended in more or less a stream of people passing me as I tottered to the finish, I was consistently passing people on my way home. This alone was a gratifying experience, even if I came in over 3:30.

I finished strong and was gratified to learn that I'd broken the mark. When I checked later, it turned out the pacer finished at just over 3:30. I was happy for him, but also happy for my decision to break away. I genuinely don't think I could have done better than this - any faster and I would have injured myself or crashed out early.

# Post-race thoughts

The post-race was a stripped-down affair not really worth noting. Some stray thoughts:

1. I was very glad that my intuition proved correct. I was hoping that the heat/elevation tradeoff would more or less equal out, and it did. I'm sure my form in those last six miles was less than exemplary, but I don't feel too terrible one day after. Mostly normal aches and pains that I would expect from any marathon, but especially one with terrain like that.

2. Running with a pacer was a revelation - I've read some very bad stories on reddits and had come in leery. I'm not sure if mine was an exceptional experience, but I would definitely do so again. I learned a lot about hill management and pace management just by running, benefited greatly from the sense of silent camaraderie that we formed until the group fell apart, and ultimately think I wouldn't have been able to do this without the pacer and the group.

3. Again, I'm not sure whether it was the pandemic-related restrictions but the race itself, in terms of infrastructure and logistics, felt underwhleming. The crowd was also fairly anemic. The start felt like some of the smaller, local races that I've been in - almost entirely informal and really no crowd control (also no crowd? When did people start? I'm really scratching my head at this because there \*were\* thousands of people running but I saw maybe a couple hundred people, if that, at the beginning with me). There was only one pacer per time group (that I saw) - again, not sure if this is because of the pandemic but I had expected multiple pacers for different groups, which I've seen in different races of various sizes, larger and smaller, before. I would be curious to know others' experiences. 

# Question for readers

If you've made it this far, I hope you weigh in on anything that stood out to you. I'm particularly interested in the hive mind's opinions on the following questions:

1. Given my time in this race, does it seem feasible to go under 3 on a flatter course in about 1/1.5 years' time if I up my training and become even more consistent? I feel that it's within my reach - I have San Francisco and Sacramento 2022 both in the books. Given that I've now run two marathons with decent(ish) times, and this time I only did 35/40-ish mpw, there are probably a lot of gains to be made by becoming even more consistent with my training and upping my mileage.

2. How do most of you manage nutrition? The bag ultimately didn't weigh me down that much, but I would like to run as unburdened as possible - however, that can only work if the course provides for it or you carry what you can in your pockets. What do you normally do? I'd like to improve that part of my race next time.",1632174912

AdvancedRunning,surfthroughlife,"Short-distance paces on point, long-distances are just short.. Training advice?","Hello all.

As a background, I just ran my 5th marathon.  Last year I jumped from 3:48 to 3:13.  The goal this year was to go sub-3 and a Boston Qualifier, ended up running a 3:00:20.  Still super happy with the growth, but my coach thought I'd be able to run a 2:50-2:55 and I thought for sure I'd be able to at least run a 2:56 at a minimum.

I ran 663 miles in the past 3.5 months, averaging high 40's per week, peaking at mid-high 60's for mileage a few weeks.  Mixed variety of workouts:

\- 400m repeats up to 16, average 74 seconds

\- Yasso 800's at 2:48 consistently up to 12x

\- Tempo runs up to 10 miles (6:18 pace)

\- Surge (Fartlek) runs with 2min of 5:30 surges with easy runs in-between up to 10x on 8 miles

\- 2 Speed workouts a week, one long run (went up to 24 miles) easy runs the rest of week (7:45-8min pace) with a day off one day a week.

My long runs were great up till 18 miles.  I ran an 18 miler at a 6:43 pace, then finished my 20 at 6:46, 22 at a 6:48, dying out to low 7 paces at the end.

My short-distance paces are on-point (5:44 5k, 6:08 10k, haven't done half marathon but I'm assuming its around a 6:20 based on how I felt at the end of my 10 miler).

I'm thinking about running another one here at the end of October to try and nail that qualifier and was looking to see if anybody has any advice or specific training routines to build up this short-distance speeds to be able to nail those last 6-8 miles.

For context, I was at a 6:47 pace at mile 19 and was knicking into 6:46 and was hoping to surge at the end to drop it down, mainly going for negative splits, as that's how I ended my 18 miler surging sub-6:20's for 3 miles at the end.

Any workout advice or specific workout suggestions are greatly appreciated!",1632158204

Investigating the influence of self-talk on mental toughness and finish times in 800-meter runners (tandfonline.com)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epub/10.1080/10413200.2020.1735574?needAccess=true) 

Hi everyone,

I'm currently a masters student in sport psychology and would like to start posting a topic article once a week to get a discussion going around mental performance, and different mental skills people use to compete in their events.  Lately, I've been digging into the literature on self-talk in ultra marathons, but this was the first I've seen that looked at the 800.

First, I'd like to say that the design of the study was absolutely brutal on the participants, but they had pretty good accolades for being relatively older runners. Multiple baseline studies are no joke, especially when they were running three 800s nearly all out in a single session, then repeating the 800s for another few weeks. 

The individual self-talk program improved their running time, but this could have also been due to the fact that they were running an 800 every other day. But it leads me to asking, what do you tell yourself when you're running flat out? Are you even talking to yourself? How do you keep yourself motivated to  drop the hammer when you're hurting?",1632141897

AdvancedRunning,sassylilmidge,Speed work/ training 8 weeks out from a marathon for experienced runner,"Training for NYC in 8 Weeks, experienced runner

Hi there - I am an experienced runner that runs every single day (about 60ish MPW, with usually one 12-15 mile long run).

I’ve been gearing up to train for NYC and was following a 16 week plan, but I hadn’t been feeling that great and backed off a lot of the speed work and just focused on getting my miles up and going long (to about 16). 

About three weeks ago, I had a major setback with an infection and emergency surgery, and had to take one full week off running and the week after that felt pretty awful too (still ran every day, but reduced mileage and no workouts or LR). This was about 11 weeks out from the marathon. 

Now we are about 8 weeks out from the NYC marathon and I did my long run yesterday (18) and finally felt good again, but I almost feel as if I’m starting my training from scratch. Is it crazy to try to push for a time goal if I start incorporating more speed work now (in addition to weekly long runs)? I ran 3:27 in the NYC 2019 marathon (my first marathon) and 3:16 in the 2020 LA marathon (4 months after). 

I was hoping to beat my 3:16 time - is it too late to start putting in speed work now to achieve this goal? In late June with 0 speed work for over a year I ran a 40:45 10K in 80 degree heat and 80% humidity. I also have a ten mile race this Sunday which can hopefully be a good indicator as well. 

TLDR; is 8 weeks of incorporating speed work before the marathon enough time to try for a time goal (for an experienced runner whose mileage has already been up/has been preparing with long slow runs already)?

Thank you!",1632139003

AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Coe vs Aouita vs ...Carlos Lopes?,"Hi all - still trying my best to post more ""advanced"" discussion topics when I can find the time.

Today I want to ask about the modern marathon, and more specifically, why it has progressed at such a faster rate than the track events have.

Pretend that it's the year 1985:

* Coe's still lighting it up and his 1:41.73 in the 800m is the world record on the track. This will ultimately be the [3rd fastest 800m of all time](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middle-long/800-metres/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;timing=electronic&amp;page=1&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-29&amp;lastDay=2021-09-15) still, even in 2021.
* Said Aouita's hot off breaking Cram's 1500m record with a time of 3:29.46 and this will also stand the test of time, being the [22nd fastest of all time in 2021](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middle-long/1500-metres/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;page=1&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-28&amp;lastDay=2021-09-14). Cram's mile time of 3:46.32 a few weeks prior will also go on to be the 4th fastest of all time in 2021.
* The longer distances don't stand as well, with Fernando Mamede's 27:13.81 10k ultimately placing 127th all time, and even Said's future 5k, that will break the 13 minute barrier, placing 90th all time. These are still quite competitive times by 2021's standards though.
* Carlos Lopes' 2:07.12 marathon though? Who would have guessed that this would only tie the personal best of [299th on the all time list in 2021](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/road-running/marathon/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;drop=regular&amp;fiftyPercentRule=regular&amp;page=3&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-27&amp;lastDay=2021-09-13). Even Dinsamo's world record in 1988 is only tied with 238th on the all time PR list. You need to go down to the 96th spot just to find the fastest marathon ran **before the year 2000** (Khalid Khannouchi's 2:05.42).

And this underscores the crazy disparity of the last 3 decades of this sport's progression. While world class times on the track 35 years ago would still be considered quite competitive today, the marathon has accelerated at a jarring pace. Certainly a 2:07 is a fast time still, but I think most of us wouldn't rank it in the same category as a 1:41 800m or a 3:46 mile. So what happened?

Clearly the shoes play a role. Take a look for yourself of all of the top times run since 2017, when the 4% was first released. But surprisingly, even absent times of the last 4 years, the breakneck improvement of the marathon is still true. Even before the super shoes, we had Kimetto and Mutai running 2:03 in Berlin together. And this is where the conversation becomes puzzling.

So I'm turning it to the room to debate what happened here:

* Beyond the modern ""super shoes"", has shoe technology really improved that much more on the roads than spikes have on the track?
* Was the marathon world record always soft because the roads didn't have the same ""notoriety"" as the track until recently?
* In a similar vein, were we just closer to the human limit on the track than we were on the roads and now the roads are catching up?
* Is it from the huge improvement in prize winnings on the road pulling younger talent over (the roads were always jested as the ""retirement home"" for track athletes)?
* Did Renato Canova come in here and just change the way that we train for the marathon? Do we need a similar training ""enlightenment"" for the track?
* Something else entirely?",1632103390
AdvancedRunning,dirtyStick84,Critique my strength training regimen,"Up until the past few months I've stayed mostly away from doing any 'real' weightlifting during run training blocks, sticking mostly to short bodyweight movement circuits.  Since returning to running after a 3 month break I have taken the exercises provided in rehab and progressed them with added weight/volume.  The split squat particularly has been amazing in helping the healing process and I believe the biggest contributor to my recovery thus far.  Anyways I am taking this training block to train with a buddy who is fairly new to running, this allows me to help him and to give myself a ramp up training block where I can train at lower speeds letting my body heal.  At this point I would like to get my weight slowly down to where I was running at before (bmi \~24 -&gt; \~22) but wondering if what I am doing in the gym is fully helping my overall cause/goals which are to firstly return safely to previous running level, next to get the bmi down to about 22 then finally to have a solid regimen I can do year round to hopefully help my prevent future injuries as best as possible.  Well here is basically what I do in the gym 2-3 times a week:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 30 min cardio (elliptical | rower | treadmill)  
\&gt; 3 X (12 Bulgarian Split Squat @ 95lb / 15 box jumps / 30 deadbug with exercise ball)  
\&gt; 3 X (12 Hex Bar Deadlift @ 155lb / 15 lateral box jump overs / 35 sit-ups)  
\&gt; 3 X (10 pullups / 10 dips / 10 oblique cable chop)  
\&gt; 3 X (10 reverse rows / 25 pushups / 60s hollow hold)

&amp;#x200B;

How might you tweak this to more specifically for say: 

\&gt; In a marathon training block  
\&gt; While trying to drop about a pound a week for a few weeks   
\&gt; In the off season

Thank you in advance for you inputs.

AdvancedRunning,scoofusa,Building MPW for Pfitz marathon training...heart rate vs pace?,"Hello, 

Me: 43 / M, 5'10"" / 187 lbs, been running since 2018. 

Best times: Marathon: 3:32, Half: 1:36.

Goal: 3:25 marathon in May 2022.

I currently run about 25 MPW and I'm trying to build miles before starting the Pfitz 55/18 plan for a marathon in May. I was running about 36 MPW in 2019 before string of injuries hit me and I've been taking it very easy to avoid having to take more time off. My goal is to get to 40+ MPW by the end of December and maintain that for a couple weeks before starting the plan. I'm thinking I'll do mostly GA runs with some hills and strides thrown in plus one R day each week until starting the plan. No tempo or speed work. I just want to add miles without hurting myself. 

I tried to do a GA pace run this morning. Going by Pfitz's description that means 9:00-9:48 per mile or 127-143 HR. I was right at 9:00 for the first mile and my HR never got above 124. So I sped up to keep it between 135-140 for the remainder of the run and ended up running long stretches at 8:00 per mile. This was with a Garmin heart rate strap and a Fenix 6 Pro so I think pace and HR were both fairly accurate.

I've never used HR for training before but this got me thinking...if I perform better when I focus on heart rate, am I selling myself short if I focus on pace for training? It's cool and overcast outside so that certainly played a part, but my resting HR goes very low when I'm in a regular running routine so I wonder if I am just in better cardiovascular shape than I realized. Of course, my volume is low. Increasing speed takes a greater toll on the rest of my body so there's that to consider. 

Just wondering...if a given training pace is supposed to match a HR in Z3 but my actual heart rate is in Z2, should I speed up? For the next two-ish months I'm primarily building mileage. Should I run in Z2 for the majority of my miles or save those for recovery days?",1632078473

Then the second mile had a lot of rolling hills - there was almost no flat part in it. I came through that mile at about 5:25, but that's when my problems started. At about mile 2.3-2.4, there was a final hill which basically killed me. I went up it fine, but as I hit the top I realized that I couldn't really lift my legs up and regain my previous pace, so I suffered through until the finish. the final 1.1 miles (which barring that hill were mostly downhill/flat) I did in about 6:15, which is a pace of about 5:40-ish per mile.

I came here 15 weeks ago to ask if my goal of 3.30 marathon by early october was realistic given the time i had left to train and my old PR:s. (See original post)

Since then I have kept up with my training religiously, only missing a couple of runs with a slight twisted ankle 2 months ago. I peaked for mileage at 49, and the training block included 7 weeks which had a 20+ mile long run.

I broke some PR:s almost by accident during the training:

My HM time went from 1.45 ish to 1.36.02, ran solo. I hadnt ran an all out HM before so tbf the old time might not reflect earlier conditioning i had.

I recently ran 42.17 on a 10k run, not completely maxing out on HR and feeling like i could've kept up the pace indefinitely

AdvancedRunning,tommsyeah,Am I ready for a sub 20 5k?,"23M

I have my first ever 5k parkrun in 9 days from now. 

Ran a 20’59” (4’12” min/km) 5k at the end of June
- it was a solo TT (not planned! And unevenly paced. I’d headed out for a tempo run and started out faster and decided to turn it into a 5k TT)
- I was running 25-35 km/week at the time
- I was only doing easy runs, no speed work at all
- long runs were 12-15km long 
- ran the TT with the Nike Pegasus 37

Since then, in last 3 months:
- I have been running 35-43 km/week
- long runs have been 14-18km
- I ran my first HM on August 22 . I finished in 1h 40m 56s). I went out a bit conservatively as I had never run that distance (and it was my first ever race) and I was afraid of bonking hard. Ended up running the first 10k of the HM in 50’30” and the last 10k of the HM in 45’05”. Last 5k was 21’35” (4’19”/Km). Last km was sub 4 min/km pace
- did some occasional tempo runs (usually 20 min long) or intervals to add some speed

I signed up for the 5k yesterday just for fun! 
So I haven’t been training specifically for a sub 20 min 5k (or for a 5k at all to be fair) but now that I’ve signed up I’m thinking I could try to aim for my first ever sub 20? Or is it absolutely crazy?

Today I did the following workout
- 1k @ 3’55”. 2 min rest
- 1k @ 3’56”. 2 min rest
- 1k @ 3’52”. 2 min rest
- 800m @ 3’06” (3’52”/km pace). 1’30” rest
- 800m @ 3’04” (3’48”/km pace). 1’30” rest
- 800m @ 3’02 (3’46”/km pace)

I did it on a track using the Pegasus 37. 
The 5k is 9 days away. Would it be crazy to attempt (for the first time in my life) a sub 20 min 5k? It would be 1 min (12s/km) faster than my June 5k but:
- I have run consistently since June 
- I have been running longer long runs and slightly more mileage, as well as occasional speed work
- I will be using the Saucony Endorphin Speed as opposed to the Pegasus 37
- mentally it will be easier to push myself I guess as it’s an organised race and not a solo TT

I am thinking I could head out @ 4’00”/km - 4’05”/km and try to hang on, and then try to get a sub 4 min last km to end under 20 minutes! What do you think? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",1631907970

AdvancedRunning,ThatRunnerDude15,Garmin vs Coros,"I currently run in a Garmin Forerunner 735XT as my GPS watch, and have for a couple years now, but recently got intrigued by the Coros Pace 2. Not really for any particular reason, though. I rarely use Garmin Connect (mainly to sync my device and then I'm done with it and jump over to Strava) and I also have no other add ons to the watch (heart rate monitor, pods, etc).

I've read articles and watched videos about the Pace 2 and how it stacks up against various other Garmin watches. They seem virtually the same to me, but obviously have their slight differences. I'm not incredibly worried about that though. 

I guess my main question is if anyone here has made the jump from Garmin to Coros? If so, what was your experience like? What made you switch? Are you glad you made the switch, regret it, mixed feelings, no feelings, etc?",1631902498

AdvancedRunning,Hellskitchenkevin,Soliciting advice on marathon goal setting for this weekend,"Since I'm driving myself crazy on this taper I figured I'd solicit some advice on goal setting for the Long Island Marathon on Sunday.

I'm a 42 year old guy.  Been running for about 7 years and have completed 12 marathons with varying degrees of success.  I've really taken the opportunity to increase my level of training over the past 2 years (running was my pandemic outlet).  

Strava says I've averaged just under 60 miles per week this year, which includes the 3 week taper I'm finishing up right now.  My weekly mileage this training cycle peaked at just over 80 miles.  I was following the training plan from my running team for this cycle which had speed/track work on Wednesdays, tempo runs on Fridays and long runs on weekends.

In the late spring I ran a half marathon in 1:24:02.  In the heavy portion of my training cycle this summer, I ran an 18:16 5k in the middle of a long run and a 23:53 4-mile race.

The course is generally flat and the weather looks to be in the 60s.  I was thinking of setting an A goal of 2:59:59 and a B goal of 3:04.  Given the information above (and feel free to ask me anything you think I might be missing), what do you all think?",1631890335

**How/when did you start running?**

Running always had my heart, dating back to my first race at age 9.

From ages 11 to 19, I attended a sleepaway summer camp in New Hampshire that had a traditional end-of-session 4-mile run that every camper and counselor had to do. The out-and-back course was ridiculously tough, out-and-back, descending 404 feet over the first two miles and climbing the same distance on the return. I always did well, though, placing high for my age group in the first few years and winning the whole thing in each of my last five years.

All the while, I also tried to convince myself I was a good baseball player.

After seeing that I didn’t have much of a future in baseball after middle school once I got shelled in my first outing on the mound in freshman ball, I joined the track &amp; field team as a sophomore (I had already done cross country). I wasn’t the fastest on either team, yet worked my butt off to become an All-State performer in each sport as a senior and get some attention from colleges.

I ran collegiately for a mid-major DI program and didn’t reach my potential by any stretch of the imagination. I often skipped practice and didn’t do the necessary things to get better (nutrition, sleep, etc.), but by the grace of God, my coach saw promise and kept me around. I turned out to be a dependable scorer in cross country and hit my peak as a junior when I earned the award for “Most Improved Athlete” at our end-of-the-year banquet.

After college, I jumped in one half marathon on a whim to pace a former rival in a full (I finished in 1:16:14) and not long after, stopped running completely for 10 years. I wasn’t burned out. I got caught up in other things that weren’t necessarily good for me and tried to fill the void with just about everything else. Plus, I thought I hurt my knee in a bad way, which scared me.

Running is so deeply engrained in my fiber that once I picked it back up four years ago, it was like two old friends meeting up again. Don’t get me wrong: Those first few months SUCKED. As I worked harder and trusted myself more, I saw marginal gains. Then I joined a local track club and things really took off. I am in better shape than I ever was in college and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me in this sport, even though I’m not getting younger.

Onward and upward, folks. That’s the only way to go!

**PRs?**

5K – 15:23 

10K – 32:15 

HM – 1:09:32 

FM – 2:36:53

**Next Race?**

I will be racing the 2021 Chicago Marathon on Sunday, October 10, as part of the American Development Program. Qualifying for the ADP was a goal I set and achieved last year with my 1:09:32 PR in the half marathon before COVID turned the world on its head. My plan was to run both the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon in 2020, but chose to forgo the opportunity to race Boston this fall in order to maintain my spot in the ADP and hopefully snag another major.

**Goals this year?**

First and foremost, I want to be injury-free for a full calendar year.

Secondly, I want to keep building on – and learn from – what I did in the past.

Otherwise, I would like to PR at the Chicago Marathon (sub-2h30 goal).

**Favorite shoes to train or race in?**

I have a steady rotation of training shoes, but favor the Brooks Ghost and Saucony Endorphin Speed (Those are actually the two pairs of shoes I grabbed before I evacuated Louisiana for two weeks due to Hurricane Ida). I use the Ghost for general runs and long runs; I grab the Speeds for aerobic tempos, regular tempos, and race-specific long run workouts.

If I race, I grab the Vaporfly or whatever is the new iteration, except for the Alphafly. I started out in the Vaporfly 4% Flyknit back in 2018 at the Rocket City Marathon and used them again at the Boston Marathon in 2019. Soon after, I switched to the Vaporfly Next% and will continue to use those or the Vaporfly Next%2, which I’m excited to bring out for the Chicago Marathon.

**What do you think has been the greatest contributor to your success in running?**

Can I name several?

If not, it’s impossible for me to narrow down.

If I can, I would start with my competitive fire and unquenchable desire to improve. That goes for all areas of my life, but especially running. I want to see how far and hard I can push myself.

On top of that, I have an analytical mind and have an innate ability to lock into a pace. Back in college, I often led workouts because I could hit the exact pace we needed without a watch (Actually, I never wore a watch until I started running again in March of 2017).

Lastly, I would say my work ethic – both inside and outside of training. I learned that from my parents, who are both self-employed and built their respective businesses from the ground up. Seeing that growing up and knowing that my parents did as much as they could to provide me and my sister with a comfortable life truly set me on the road to know the value of a work ethic.

**If you had a year to train, with no other distractions, how fast do you think you could get?**

Much faster than I am today, especially if I had access to elite recovery methods.

**What’s your favorite distance to race and why?**

Hands down, it’s the half marathon.

Anything shorter than a 5-mile or 10K feels like a sprint.

It’s nearly impossible to right the ship in a 5K (if you hit the wall early) and we all know how unpredictable and dependent on other variables marathons can be. If you get perfect weather and nail your hydration and nutrition, you can do amazing things over 26.2 miles.

While I can settle into a decent groove in a 10K, I feel like I’m in a true flow state or mindless rhythm in a half marathon. Sure, I’ve plunged deep into the Pain Cave around mile 8 or 9 in most of them – but slaying that mental demon at the bottom and clawing your way out has you feeling on top of the world for the last 5K or however much you have left in the race.

**Favorite (or most successful) training style/principles that you follow?**

Keep your easy days easy.

Successful training blocks are built one day and workout at a time. Likewise, a successful training block aren’t derailed by one bad day or workout. Learn from it and move on.

A lot of people like to focus on heart rate. I just run.

**Proudest Accomplishment?**

Running – Being resilient enough to not only bounce back from injury after injury after injury, but to hit huge PRs along the way. That was a 32:31 10K, 25:23 5-mile, as well as a 1:11:43 half marathon – which eventually dropped to 1:09:32 – after a severe hamstring pull in 2019. That was a 15:32 5K (now 15:23) and a 32:15 10K after a sacral stress fracture in 2020.

Not running – Being a role model for my nephew.

**Things you do outside of running?**

Other than work?

I mean, something must pay for the races and shoes.

Fitness is a MAJOR impetus for me, as you can see from the handle.

I try to hit the gym at least three times per week and have a daily yoga practice.

Got into cycling when I recovered from a sacral stress fracture and enjoyed that, too. Before, I’d just ride; but, as I built back from the injury, I’d try to mix in some workouts and developed a new appreciation for the sport. Running fitness doesn’t translate that well to cycling fitness. I will say that those workouts helped me bounce back from the injury better than ever before.

**Things that interest you outside of running?**

Improving myself by any means necessary and anything that comes along with it.

**Favorite subreddits?**

Is my mother going to read this!?

Just kidding.

I’m most active in r/advancedrunning and r/artc (for obvious reasons), dabble in r/triathlon (when I dip my toe into that sport), as well as r/mma and r/squaredcircle (because we all need our mindless entertainment from time to time).

**Origin of your username?**

It’s my Instagram handle, where I started chronicling my fitness &amp; running journey back in January of 2018. It only made sense to use it when I started posted in r/advancedrunning.

AdvancedRunning,booduz,2 Weeks Out - Is Sub-3 Possible?,"30M, 5ft9, 165lb with an original planned target goal of 3:05.

I'm running Chester Marathon on the 3rd October after coming to the end of Pfitz 12/55. I'd planned to follow the 18/55 plan but had been running around 35mpw prior to starting the plan and ran two trail races (a 20M with 3k feet of elevation and a 27m with 4k feet of elevation) so I opted for the shorter plan to take a few weeks to recover. I don't feel I've missed out too much by going for the shorter plan.

The training block has gone very well - I've only missed two runs from the schedule due to family commitments (an 11m medium-long run and a 4m recovery run). I've also hit or exceeded all of my target paces during speedwork and the MP long runs.

I ran a track 10K TT 2 weeks ago in 38:34 (Mile Splits: 6:20, 6:15, 6:18, 6:15, 5:59, 0.2@5:37). The last 1.2M suggests I might have had a bit more in the tank? Would like to think i'd break 38 minutes in an actual race.

Is sub-3 on the cards? I don't want to risk blowing up and missing my 3:05 goal but if sub-3 is a real possibility (especially with Chester being such a flat course) then I feel I should take the opportunity to go for it.",1631873142

AdvancedRunning,e7series,Postponing Berlin Marathon due to Achilles Issue,"I started the 18/55 Pfitz plan earlier this year to aim for a sub 3 in the Berlin Marathon in 10 days. About 2.5 weeks ago, I decided to sign up for a local half marathon race and did not properly warm up before hand. I ended up finishing the race in Marathon pace but I completely overdid it and now my achilles is paying the price. 

Since then, I've had all the normal symptoms of insertional achilles tendonitis - tight / slight pain when waking up in the morning, pain that goes away after warming up but never gets any better etc. Luckily there is no physical bump on my achilles. 

So for the last 2.5 weeks since the injury, I have been taking it slower and took off a lot of the key workouts left in the training plan. 

After reading a lot of the resources online and considering that I'm still fairly young at 32, I've decided to postpone the Berlin Marathon for 2022. Considering that my achilles is not getting better (nor worse), I want to fully rest for 6 to 8 weeks so I can be fully prepared for my next training cycle later this year. I do not want this to turn into a degenerative issue. 

During the rest time, I will be doing eccentric calf raises while also strengthening other areas of my body. 

I, of course, feel quite upset over the whole situation but I'm fortunate to have raced my personal best in the 5k (18m11s), 10k (38m04s), and HM (1h23m37s) during the training cycle.

* A new workout
* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Progressive Long Run**.

*History:*

From Lee Troop, three-time Olympian for Australia and holds a personal best of 2:09:49 for the distance. He now coaches some of the best runners in the United States, including Jake Riley, who placed second in the 2020 Olympic Trials marathon.

One of Troop’s key marathon-specific workouts is a progressive long run, done twice during the last two months before the race,   eight weeks out from their goal race, then again four weeks out. They use this workout to also practice their fluid and fuel intake: taking a water bottle every three miles.

*Why:*

One of Troop’s key marathon-specific workouts is a progressive long run, done twice during the last two months before the race.   They use this workout to also practice their fluid and fuel intake: taking a water bottle every three miles.

“It gives me a really good indication of what they’ll be able to hit [on race day],” Troop says. “If they hit it, we can go into the last couple weeks [of training] with a lot of confidence.”

*How:*

An 18-mile long run that starts off easy and gets faster every 3 miles. The last 6 miles are completed at goal marathon pace.

For example: If your goal marathon pace is 7:30 per mile, begin the run with 3 miles at an easy training pace. Then run miles 4-6 at 8:15 per mile, miles 7-9 at 8:00 per mile, miles 10-12 at 7:45 per mile, and the last 6 miles at your goal marathon pace of 7:30 per mile.

I in particular struggle quite badly in the heat, and with not getting enough water from drink stations and pushing too hard to stay with the 2nd woman ended up with heat exhaustion at mile 21. 

This was my first marathon and I will say the learning curve was tough, I have no problems with half marathons but just pressured myself to hit my training target despite the weather and circumstances. 

My question is this, exactly 4 weeks after Brighton is Manchester on Sunday 10th Oct. 
I’m going out for a 5M recovery today and have uploaded the P&amp;D 4 week marathon bridging plan in Advanced marathoning to my garmin to follow. 
I do have a half marathon race a week on Sunday (2 weeks before marathon number 2) and am thinking to do it all MP (but this time drop MP to 2:59:59) and see how I feel, then pop in an 18 miler 10 days before and go straight to taper. 

Has anyone successfully done 2 marathons 4 weeks apart? It would be extra helpful if anyone has blown up the first and done the second without incident.",1631700188
AdvancedRunning,Cameron94,Easy /recovery pace so slow compared to friends of a similar speed,"27, male, 5k time around low 17, pb is 17:07. Weekly mileage around 37-42 miles a week on normal training weeks

Training week is normally: Monday rest, Tuesday interval, Wednesday recovery, Thursday rest, Friday Tempo run, Saturday easy 6-8 miles, Sunday long run of 1hr-2 hrs varied 

I've noticed my easy stuff is at least a minute per mile slower than guys I train with who are around 16:40-17:30 5k pace. These guys also do  twice as much mileage, and 3 speed sessions a week to my two (Tuesday interval and Friday Tempo) I've also notived guys who are a few min slower than me at 5k are able to keep up faster easy stuff 

The day after my Tuesday intervals my recovery run of 4 miles is anywhere from 8-8:50 miling. Recently its been 8:40s, yet my friends wake up and smash out 6 miles at 7:10s? I don't understand how they do it.  If I tried to go quicker it would feel like an actual effort. 

My normal weekly easy stuff is anywhere from 7:40-8:30 but most of the time it's all below 8. Usually 8:10s. My legs on easy days do feel generally quite tired. Which is strange for such relatively low mileage. 

I guess this must be what is simply best for myself as an individual? I still seem to get the same quality in my workouts, for instance I was doing late 2:30 ish 800 reps last night and felt great. but it simply must be my way my body likes to run and manage?",1631698860
AdvancedRunning,SEMIrunner,How can a runner best recover from post-viral fatigue/Long COVID?,"Got sick with an unknown virus back in Feb/March 2020 and not been the same since. Might of gotten COVID and Long COVID, but never was tested initially and later tests never confirmed it. Was the worst sickness I've ever had, tho, where I had no fever but had trouble breathing for several weeks, followed by a roller-coaster that still doesn't seem to be quite done. It's clear at least, doctors say, that I've had  post-viral fatigue. It stinks, although I'm grateful for the health I currently have and talking with me you probably wouldn't realize what I've been through/going through. Still, I would appreciate any constructive advice in regards to running/health/life. My story (with apologies for length/thanks for your time):

I'm a man in my 40s. Before the illness, I was running 20-25 miles a week, getting ready to ramp up to 40 mpw as part of marathon training that spring. I also was swimming 2.5-3K a week (masters class) and riding a bike about an hour a week usually inside. Previous year I ran about a 320 and my pb is 249 from 20 years ago, around same time frame when I also did an Ironman (12 hrs). Have done close to 20 marathons overall, but not been as active the past 5-10 years because of family/career.

That summer was the toughest of the symptoms, where I had heart palpitations, dizziness, burning lungs and post-exertional malaise often whenever I tried to start back running again, even 1 mile only. Was able to walk, tho, a ton, which helped. Then I slowly added 30 minute bike rides and run-walking workouts, especially as standard heart/lung tests showed I was otherwise healthy outside these symptoms. I purposely had at least 1 day between any workout, because symptoms would return otherwise. In connecting with people suffering from long COVID and similar conditions on social media, I quickly found out less is more and that exercise can cause relapses.

Taking it slow and with doctor's approval, over the winter, I made more progress, eventually building up to 10-12 miles a week a few times, including an hour-long walk run and fairly successful 30-minute speed workouts. I even continued to bike 30-40 minutes once a week despite cold weather. But each time I'd invariably hit a wall where the symptoms would return, either from post-exercise or what appeared to be regular cold symptoms, which would waylay me sometimes for a week. Note, I tested for COVID a few times during this period but never positive.

Eventually, in the spring I got the COVID vaccine and that seemed to help with the recurring symptoms for a time but by summer as I tried to slowly build up again, I soon found out I had trouble running more than 30 minutes or more than 1 or 2 times a week. This is because when I do, I either find myself with more cold symptoms AND/OR my lungs burn, like a sore throat. What's maddening, too, is I often feel better after fitness before these symptoms descend and a few times I've experienced them at the same time. (One other win, tho, was returning to the pool and I've tried to fit in some swims lately, although it's sporadic).

Now some of my condition is probably from a loss of fitness. Throughout this time, my weight slowly increased to 25 pounds more than before my illness, peaking a few months ago, although I've now dropped about 10 from a better diet/fewer calories. Also, aside from my slower run times (now 1-2 minutes per mile slower on all runs), my estimated V02 max on my watch is 10 lower than it was previously but still great for my age.

So, here's the bottom line. Medically, I'm mostly considered healthy/recovered and there's not much doctors can do at the moment, which makes sense since they're busy and it's still a pandemic. And I'm happy not to be any worse off, because so many are who are currently battling this terrible disease AND who still suffer even far more debilitating symptoms from long COVID from early 2020.

Yet, in a way, I'm still injured and I haven't figured out how to treat it like a sore hamstring OR knee. Before there were times in my life where I got out of shape but I always could run a fair distance, as long as it was slow enough. I could endure the pain and the fatigue and never be out of breath. Now, I don't know how to handle sore lungs. No one seems to know.

And while I can accept I may never be the masters runner or athlete I was -- I've long abandoned my 20s/early 30s self for good reason -- I do not want to give up trying to be active or have running goals, especially now as I have genuine concern for my long-term health and still see fitness as a key to lots of positive things. (I often wonder now if many longtime runners quit after something like this where their joints didn't wear out but their overall health/lungs did).

Can anyone relate? Any sports med docs out there with thoughts? What's the best path forward for someone like me?",1631678434
AdvancedRunning,Forsaken-Stomach4093,Race Pace Help!!,"Getting into crunch time for Chicago which is in \~3weeks. This means it's time for me to start scrambling to figure out a good race pace target after hot summer sessions in the South.

I was introduced to the wild world of summer marathon training for Chicago 2019. Brutal Mississippi summer heat and humidity had beat me down to a point I had zero confidence going into the race.... low and behold the marathon featured my ideal weather of low 40s F, and I put in a PR at a pace 40sec faster than my average pace throughout June-Sept training. 

Fast forward to 2021. I have my eyes on making a big PR this go around. I have felt extremely good during this training block. I am consistently putting in more work, especially structured interval work, and I am averaging around 32sec faster a mile over more and longer runs in the same period as my 2019 campaign. 

With how things went in 2019, I am trying to figure out what kind of race pace to target this go around. It is so hard for me to wrap my head around it all because my long runs in MS are done in 90 degree weather with high humidity and no wind and hopefully Chicago will be on the chillier side again.

### Training

I'm going to save the pandemic story for the Chicago race report, but in short I'm currently on Pfitz 18 week 85 mpw plan with the goal of going
02:50 in Chicago next month. Why do I think 2:50 is possible? Because two months ago I ran a comfortable 17:41 5k TT. However, it's been a mental suckfest since.

For the month of August, I had a couple rough weeks where runs were slow and I had to take a couple days off to deal with a cranky soleus.
But I've always had issues with the middle of Pfitz's plans, so I kept telling myself that things would start getting better as we approached
the final weeks before taper. I still hit over 90% of the mileage, but I didn't survive two threshold workouts, which put me in a bad headspace.

Two weeks ago I had my first tune-up race at the Santa Rosa 10k, where I had high expectations of a good outing. Unfortunately,
I blew up after two miles and didn't PR. The week after I had a decent 90 mile week, but couldn't hold marathon pace in a 20 mile long. So heading into
this race, I wasn't feeling great.

### Pre-race

Flew in to LA the day before, napped all day in the hotel room, then went on a recovery run and had an early dinner. In bed by 10PM, up at 4:30AM.
Coffee, shit, eat, shit some more, then I was off to the start line at 6AM. Checked in my gear, warmed up, into the front of the chute.

It was a very cool experience because of 9/11; firefighters, EMTs, police, veterans,
families, friends, were all out to support. The fire department hung a giant American flag above the start line from a fire engine ladder, there was a moment of
silence. And the anthem sent chills down my spine.

### Race

Gun goes off and planes in a v-formation flew over us with red, white, and blue smoke. Temperature is 65 degrees. Plan was to keep 5k splits
between 19:25 and 19:55, roughly 6:15-6:25 / mile. I knew that my goal marathon equivalent wasn't possible that day, but I liked the idea of
aiming for a PR along with a wide target range.

First 5k followed up pacific coast highway, very flat, very comfortable but also zero shade to hide from the giant hydrogen bomb raging in the sky.

**5k split - 19:36 - 6:19/mi**

The second 5k heads east into a neighborhood with a small bit of climbing before winding around a block and heading back onto the highway. I didn't
do great on the hills cause my legs are fatigued, but managed to stay within the goal range.

**10k split - 19:55 - 6:25/mi**

We turn back on the highway and my heart rate begins to rapidly climb, eventually past threshold. Temperatures are now well into the 70s
and I'm fully exposed. I hold on as long as I could to 6:29, one second faster than my PR pace, while my heart rate bounced off threshold BPM.
With a km left in the split, my HR can't stay below threshold any longer and I slow down even more.

**15k split - 20:15 - 6:31/mi**

I knew I still had a shot at a PR, until mile 11 when a tiny fucking hill took everything out of me. After the hill, I went full survival mode,
under no circumstances did I want to fail to break 1:30. The last couple miles of the race I was fighting to stay under 7:00/mi, my heart rate well above threshold at this point.

**20k split - 21:25 - 6:54/mi**

About half a mile before the finish line, the course split. Half marathoners went straight to the finish line, but the full marathoners were routed back because they were only
at mile 16. So if you ran the marathon, you'd see the finish line literally half a mile away before you turned back up the road for another 10 miles. For some reason, that
made me feel a bit better and I was able to come home strong.

**21.1k split - 6:47/mi**

### Post-race

I felt fine. I checked the weather and it was 79F/24C. Lot of friends ran positive splits, very few PRs that day. The next day I was able to comfortably run an 18 mile long,
which told me I hadn't raced to my full potential. I doubt there was anything I could have done differently, I don't train in a hot environment nor am I training for a
particularly warm race. Surf City was forced to move to September this year, so I hope this doesn't turn anyone off from running it since it's normally a winter race.

On a positive note, I got valuable experience in dealing with a runaway heart rate in a race. Up until this race, all my previous blow-ups were due to muscle fatigue.
I was able to trust my training to ensure I finish the race strong.

I'm still seeking that elusive validation that a 2:50 is possible for me, and my last shot will be in two weeks at my last tune-up race, a flat 10k. Fortunately, that race is
during a taper week, so I'm keeping positive thoughts!

### Conclusions

As someone who used to never do tune-up races, I'd like to encourage everyone to do them throughout your season. The experience is invaluable, and you learn how to deal with all
sorts of mishaps. Lastly, thank you to the community and the mods.",1631661637
AdvancedRunning,WusiSniper_,Transition from road running to XC running,"Hey all,

I am looking to get into XC running/racing and I'm wondering what would be the best method to working my way up to using XC spikes. Currently I only run on roads and trails so I've never ran in spikes before. It sounds like it can wreck your calves pretty good the first go around. Do XC runners normally train in road shoes on cross country courses before the season?

I (22M) have a little over two years of consistent running experience including with a handful of road races 5k to half marathon distance. Also I am currently averaging around 35-40 mpw.

So... I ran very seriously in high school, but got a chronic case of shin splints that put me out for 2+ years. I was able to start running again about 12 weeks ago, from doing a lot of PT and changing my form, but 8 weeks ago I got injured again (pain in my hip flexor/groin). I've always been very injury prone and that has constantly hindered my performance, as well as just not letting me run. I've worked with various PT/Physios to varying degrees of success. But recently I've been running on my current injury (just running enough to not be in too much pain, like 10-15 mpw), and just realizing how clunky my form feels. Overall I just do not feel smooth or efficient, like how most highly talented runners look. 

I've tried running specific weightlifting (I followed *Running Rewired* for a while*)*, core exercises, flexibility exercises, foam rolling, glute activation, etc etc etc. Its not that these things haven't helped me, but I would like to do these things from a unified, focused perspective, not just doing various exercises/plans on my own.

Basically, I'm looking for online personalized coaching/personal training to rebuild and remodel my body, from someone very experienced with working with runners like me. Does this exist? I know there are many, many personal trainers on the internet, so I figured this must exist for runners specifically.

AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Quality long runs in marathon training,"I just watched a sweat elite workout video of Ian Butler (2:09 marathoner) and it was really cool to hear him talk about training philosophy on stuff like doing workouts by feel, but at the end he talked about the long run and said something that kind of surprised me:

&gt;The weekly miles take care of the endurance, but you need the speed workouts to tune it up. I'm not a big long run guy, I really struggle on them....I'm definitely not one to push the pace ever on the long run. There's a lot of benefits to it of course but I'd rather be fresh for these (workouts) than tire myself out on the long run. I picture a long run being just running long on tired legs, that's it...I get my legs tired throughout the week, and then I go out and do 2:20 on them on sunday.

Being someone who also really struggles with (and hates lol) fast long runs but likes workouts, that sounds great. I find I can bounce back from a workout after 1-2 easy days but those hard long runs are more like 3-4 and I feel like total garbage for the first 2. But I am wondering how applicable that strategy is to someone like me running 50mpw which is probably under half what he runs, because it seems most marathon plans include at least some marathon pace tempos or speedwork in some of the long runs. Jack daniels 2Q for example is almost like two long runs a week with many of them being quite challenging.

So how important are those fast long runs to us average joes? Are they necessary to go the distance without bonking or mentally cracking, or can modest mileage with two workouts a week and a long run done by feel get you strong enough to do alright? Is it a personal thing, and what can you do to maximize your chances of running well with this approach?",1631646803

AdvancedRunning,MotivicRunner,A Comparison of Running Economy Across Seven Carbon-Plated Racing Shoes,"**Please note that this is a** ***preprint*** **-- it has not yet been peer reviewed. Even though as a layperson it looks to me like this was a well-conducted study, treat these results as preliminary until this paper is actually published in a scientific journal.**

I believe [this preprint from Dr. Dustin Joubert of Stephen F. Austin University](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/kinesiology/33/) is the first controlled lab study that compares many of the carbon-plated racing shoe options currently available (Asics Metaspeed Sky, Brooks Hyperion Elite 2, Hoka Rocket X, New Balance RC Elite 1, Nike Alphafly, Nike Vaporfly Next% 2, and Saucony Endorphin Pro 1)  against each other and against a contemporary traditional racing flat (Asics Hyperspeed). 

He worked with 12 well-trained male runners (in \~15:30-17:30 5km shape or equivalent at the time of the study) and measured running economy, as well as some other measurements associated with running mechanics, at a speed of 16km/hr (i.e. 3:45/km or 6:02/mi).

The entire preprint is worth reading for anyone interested in the intersection of shoe tech and exercise science. Here are some of my initial thoughts/takeaways from reading through it.

* The Vaporfly and Alphafly are still the gold standard for super shoes (average running economy improvement of 3% and 2.7%, respectively), but the Metaspeed Sky is also very competitive as well (average running economy improvement of 2.5%). All three of these average improvements over the traditional flat were statistically significant. Assuming I read the graph in Figure 2 correctly, it even seems like the Metaspeed Sky actually provided the most improvement for some individuals.
* Brooks and Hoka have their work cut out for them to improve the Hyperion Elite 2 and Rocket X to a level that is competitive with the best carbon-plated racers currently on the market. On average those shoes did not provide a statistically significant improvement in running economy over the traditional flat. That's especially painful considering the huge gap in price between the Hyperspeed ($90) and those shoes (Hyperion Elite 2 @ $250, Rocket X @ $180).
* Building on the previous thought, this study seems to reinforce that a super foam (e.g. PEBA) working in tandem with a carbon-fiber element -- not just a carbon-fiber element in and of itself -- is what make super shoes ""super."" Hoka in particular seems to be very stuck with traditional variations on EVA, so at this point I personally don't think the Carbon X or Rocket X can be classified as true super shoes.
* I'd like to see some more discussion about the individual variation in response to the various shoes. The graph in Figure 2 shows that to an extent, but it is hard to read for that purpose since it was created to highlight the group average trend.
* Most likely due to limited availability, the study didn't include the Adios Pro (either V1 or V2). In my mind that would have been one of the most interesting comparisons, since at the elite level Adidas is the main competitor to Nike. I hope future research can be done that includes the Adios Pro.
* I want to see this study repeated with female runners. Since women are not small men, there could be important differences in how women respond to the various carbon-plated racers. Even if there isn't a difference, having more evidence that, when combined with this study, better reflects the entire population of runners is a good thing.
* I'm looking forward to one of the [current projects that Dr. Joubert is working on](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTlGvvdAQGg/), which will investigate the effects of super shoes on running economy at paces slower than 14km/hr (i.e. 4:17/km or 6:54/mi).",1631638108

I have a great endurance base built with many back-to-back training runs of 20+ miles and a long run of 50 miles.

I do know that there are aspects of my fitness that I could work on throughout the year to greatly improve my chances of winning next year. 

I also do not want to lose the endurance gains while I work on strength, speed, and hills.

AdvancedRunning,PhilYourBoots-,Half marathon training - sick during peak weeks,"25M training for first half marathon - goal 1:22/1:23

So I have half marathon race coming up on 17th October and this last week I’ve come down with a nasty cold and cough. Tried a few runs but my HR was sky high and didn’t feel up to it. Im likely to miss the remainder of this week til I’m fit to start training again. 

I’ve been building from 40 to 70 miles over the last 16 weeks. My plan was to hold 70 miles a week for the next 3 weeks and then taper for the last 2 but this cold has got in the way of last week which was supposed to end on 67 miles but instead ended at 53 and is now chewing into my first 70 mile week. 

So my question is how do I approach the next few weeks? Do I continue when I feel fit and get two 70 mile weeks in and taper as planned, do I shorten my taper from two weeks to 9-10 days and try to make up some more miles or will there not be much benefit from this? 

Set a 10 mile PR at 6:11/mi @ 1:02 last week so I was confidently aiming for 1:22 / 1:23. Will a week off at this point in training mean I need to reassess my goal? 

This is my first race and first ever proper training block so thanks for the advice in advance!",1631605956

## Training

I (M23) played soccer in college and have been running after graduating as a way to stay in shape. I ran \~40 miles per week from January 2020 to May 2020 in preparation for a fall marathon. When the marathon went virtual, I lost a lot of motivation and my mileage dropped to 20-30 miles per week through the summer and fall. I ended up running 1:34 for a half marathon in June and 3:46 for a fall marathon (though that includes several breaks to chat with friends and family along the way).

In January 2021, I built up to \~50 miles per week and coasted around there until late spring. I started the Pfitz 18/70 plan with a goal marathon scheduled for October 10th. The plan has gone pretty well so far, with a few down weeks for a couple of mid-summer vacations. I made sure to hit all of the key workouts and have run almost all of the scheduled miles.

My dad ran a 3:08 marathon in his early 30s and qualified for Boston. I've wanted to beat his time for a while now and I'm hoping that this is the cycle that will get me there. My main goal is to go sub 3 for this marathon and it would be icing on the cake to be able to run Boston in the spring. I wanted to hit 1:25 in this race before attempting to go sub 3 in October.

## Pre-race

My girlfriend and I drove to a neighboring town and spent the night about 15 minutes from the starting point. I ran a pretty high mileage week the week prior and my legs were still a little heavy. I put them up for 20 minutes to help freshen them up before hitting the hay. 

As it was a smaller event, we picked up our bibs and goodie bags the morning of the race. I woke up around 5:15, ate my customary pre-race meal of 2 pieces of bread with heaping scoops of raspberry jam, used the bathroom, and was out the door by 5:50. The half started at 8:00, but we had to be there to pick up our stuff by 6:30 so that the marathoners could start at 7:00. 

The national anthem played, the marathoners took off, and we boarded the shuttle to get to the starting point for the half. Once we got to the start line, we still had about 35 minutes to use the bathroom and warm up before the race started. I went to the bathroom again, did some stretches, put on my race shoes, ran a couple strides, then felt pretty ready to go.

## Race

When the horn went off, I took off in the lead flying down the bike path. I don't wear carbon fiber shoes very often and the adrenaline got the best of me. After about a minute, I looked down at my watch and saw that I was running 5:40 pace and immediately took my foot off of the gas. Although my plan was to shoot for 6:30s to start, I settled into 6:15ish pace, which felt pretty comfortable.

There was a hairpin turn 0.9 miles into the course before the course went back into town. I noticed that I had opened up a 30 second lead on the guy in second place. I passed the rest of the runners and exchanged some encouraging words. Miles 1-3.5 were pretty darn flat and seemed to just tick by. At around the 4-mile mark, the bike path went slightly uphill. This change in elevation was accompanied by a shift from smooth pavement to hard, slightly damp moss. The whole course was on a bike path that was usually paved but had several stretches of semi-loose gravel, moss, and grass. My shoes ended up holding their grip fairly well and the elevation didn't slow me down as much as I initially thought it would.

At the end of mile 6, I crested the hill and the course went through an old train tunnel. On the other side of the tunnel was a lovely gradual downhill. By this point in the race, I convinced myself that I could probably maintain 6:15-6:20 pace, so I should adjust my initial plan and go for it. At an aid station around mile 8.5, I squeezed 3/4 of a chocolate GU into my mouth and managed to get a couple of ounces of water to wash it down. I haven't practiced drinking out of cups while running and I quickly discovered that I'm not naturally gifted at it. 

I did some tired mental math at mile 10 and figured I could finish in 1:23:XX if I could keep my pace, with an outside chance of going sub 1:23. Miles 11 and 12 were much less shaded than the trail and I could feel the sun getting stronger by the minute. I was trying to focus on my cadence, but I could tell that I had lost the spring in my step that I had an hour prior. I mustered up some energy for the last mile because I realized that I was really close to breaking 1:23. I saw the finish line from about 200m away and kicked hard. I crossed the finish line and saw that I ran 1:23:06!

## Post-race

The race organizer came over to congratulate me on winning and asked that I stick around for the awards ceremony. I got my ticket for an apple dumping (tasted just as good as it sounds) and chatted with some of the locals. I was really happy to win my first race and come home with a cool gold medal.

I'm really happy with the time, especially given the conditions. The weather was fairly warm, so it's a confidence booster knowing that it will hopefully be a little cooler in a month. I'm planning to start at 6:45 pace for the marathon, assuming good conditions. Fingers crossed this is a good sign for sub 3!

AdvancedRunning,Nayaa03,Is Running Not for Me?,"I am a senior in HS. I’ve gone into my story in detail so I’m just going to be quick about it now. I’ve had 3 stress fractures, 1 on my lower left back and 2 on my right fibula. I’ve also had 2 surgeries that were unrelated to running but set me back in my fitness. I’ve also had 2 ankle sprains, and multiple stress reactions in my feet. I have also dealt with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis. All of these injuries I have dealt with in the past three years. I’ve been to so many physical therapy sessions for each injury as well as many different doctors, but I can’t seem to get a break from these injuries. I missed my entire freshman year, and was finally able to run my sophomore year. I had a pretty good sophomore year when it came to running. I had a 18:52 5k, 10:58 3200m, and 5:05 mile, and these times were all achieved during cross country and winter track. I missed my sophomore spring track season due to an emergency surgery, and I ran only a couple races during my junior year and was a lot slower since I was running through injury. During the summer of my junior year going into senior year I got a second stress fracture on my fibula. I just recently recovered from that stress fracture and after weeks of PT I was cleared to run again. Last week I had my first race in cross country which was a 4K. I ran such a slow time, even during recovery days I run faster then what I ran. Also, after the run my fibula, which I had two stress fractures on, STILL hurts. Now I’m just so disappointed and I honestly just want to quit. I don’t know what it is with me, I’ve gotten my running form analyzed, I’ve even been to a chiropractor. I just can’t seem to get a break from injury and it’s honestly making me hate running.",1631586944

### TL;DR
Did my first 100km. Asked this sub if I was capable of ludicrously fast times. [Was informed I would not be](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/pjy5dh/100km_ultramarathon_choosing_a_goal_time/). Revised goals down but they were still far too ambitious. Faded very badly and at the 3/4 point had a genuine crisis of the soul. Rallied just enough to get to the finish. Learned a lot about myself as a runner and a person. Deeply humbled by the experience, but also grateful for it.

### Training
M34 who took up running in 2018 to lose weight. I did my first marathon in 2019. In 2020 I had a breakthrough year and hit a lot of PBs including two sub-3 marathons, sub-37 10K and a sub-18 5K. For a long time I had felt fat and unathletic and I really came to love running; it gave me a feeling of achievement and pride in my body. As I would come to discover, I had become maybe too dependent on this feeling of progress. 

Unfortunately I picked up a case of plantar fasciitis in autumn 2020 which disrupted my training until April this year. During lockdown I decided that when I could go outside again, I would spend as much time in nature and the outdoors as possible. What better way than trail ultras.
 
I built back to weekly mileage of 80-90km with peaks of 100+. I ran a couple of flat 50Ks in June and a c. 75km trail race with 1500m elevation in July. The goal with these had been to finish strong but with an eye to further training. Thames Path would be my first 100km but also my A race for the autumn, and given it was a very flat route, and I was used to planning and executing races well, I was feeling ambitious and decided to go for sub-10hrs.
 
My last 5 weeks of training. Weekly totals plus highlights:

* 97km (including the 75km race in c. 8h 20m. I aggravated an ankle problem so started doing some recovery runs on elliptical to take pressure off it)
* 30km (+ 1hr elliptical) - recovery week
* 95km (+ 30 mins elliptical), including a fast HM B race (1:27)
* 106km (+ 2hrs elliptical), finished the week with a marathon in 3:40, most of it at sub 5:00/km pace with some warm up and cool down miles.
* last week: 78km (start of taper)

### Pre-race
I readied my kit and drop bag contents the night before using an extensive pre-race routine written on my phone. I refine and improve the routine every time I race and find it helpful for staying organised. I will add a comment with my kit list if helpful 

**Shoes:** I used a pair of Hoka One One Clifton 7s which I had already done one training marathon in. In training, I run with a pair of insoles to relieve pressure on my plantar fascia and posterior tibial tendon. Over shorter races I use [Algeos rear-foot wedges](https://www.algeos.com/arch_adjusted_rearfoot_wedge.html) to help control my foot from rolling inward but without the weight of a heavy plastic insole. I had agonised over whether to use these for this ultra, thinking the less weight the better over long distances. Eventually I decided not to risk my tendons for the sake of a few grams, and go with the plastic insole. I think it was the right call.

**Vest:** I ran with a cheap [Aoinijie 18L vest](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08C5K6L68/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) which I think is excellent for the price, plus 2 x 600ml bottles with straws from the same brand (I find camelbacks too heavy and difficult to refill). 
 
I spent the preceding two days carb loading by eating more bread and rice and avoiding fats. I got to bed at 11pm and slept soundly. The alarm went off at 4:30am for a 6:50 race start. I ate a breakfast of a cereal bar and porridge. I drank two coffees to stimulate a movement, which I thought worked (in hindsight this was a mistake...)

I knew that the chafing, blistering and gut problems that might irritate me in a marathon could blow up into race-ending issues over longer distances. So I used a lot of vaseline in every crevice and threw a fair amount of 2Toms Blistershield powder in my socks and back up socks (although I had to empty some out as it made little lumps in them). I took a pre-emptive immodium and stored more in my vest for the halfway point. I wore knee high compression socks with another pair of shin compression gear over the top of those. And although it would be a cloudy day in England, I still threw factor 50 sunblock on, just in case. 

I took a cab to the start line which cost a fortune but I wasn't about to walk to the bus given the amount of time I would be on my feet that day. The race set off from a small park in West London next to the Thames. The event was mainly for walkers but it also catered to runners who had an early start time. The weather was cool and clear in the morning, and the day was set to be cloudy albeit a little hotter than normal.

### Strategy
 
My hydration strategy was to drink one of my 600ml bottles between aid stations which were spaced every 10 to 14km. 
 
My nutrition strategy was to get 250 calories an hour from a combination of solid food at checkpoints with a Gu gel in between; I knew from experience that a diet of 100% gels would destroy my insides after 50km, but with plenty of immodium and a mix of foods, I would be ok. I had some old SIS gels I brought with me just in case I needed something isotonic (to combat dehydration) or caffeine free to give my guts a rest. My parents very kindly followed me in their car between checkpoints throughout the day to provide support, and they also carried a bag of Tailwind. I threw a couple of scoops into one of the 600ml bottles for an easy source of carbs and electrolytes, and to provide another option in case my GI tract began to rebel. 

### Race

**0 - 25km**
The race was very well organised with an easy check in and bag drop, and we started bang on time. I settled into a comfortable rhythm at around 5:45/km, firmly on 10 hour pace, as we began to move west from the centre of town towards the sights of West London (Kew Gardens and Hampton Court Palace). I said hello to and chatted with a few competitors and told them my target time, which I would begin to regret later in the race. One runner kept overtaking me, but I would pass him when he took walking breaks; he told me this was because he had a sensitive gut and walking made it easier to digest. I would be taking this advice myself later in the day. 

Unfortunately I managed to miss a turning early on and cut around 500m of the course. Wrong turns later in the day would more than make up for this distance but it was a bad early omen. The path occasionlly turned away from the river and wound back and forth between the north and south banks of the Thames. More than once I would have to ask passers by if they had seen route markers up ahead. I twice had to call out to another runner ahead of me that he had missed a turn and was off course.

Aid stations had plenty of chocolate, bananas and energy drinks which I stocked up on at every chance. I remembered reading, ""An ultramarathon is an eating competition with running thrown in"" on this sub and was determined not to let this do me in.

The Thames Path runs through towns, villages and near empty countryside, much of it flat and green. In the morning we passed many rowers training, and later in the day there were families playing and picnicking by the water, and after lunch a few merry bands enjoying drinks on boats. There was the occasional turn onto dual carriageways or through uninspiring architecture, but for the most part it was a really lovely tour. The organisers had marked every kilometre and as the event progressed, passers by, walkers and other runners on the path offered plenty of encouragement which was so great to receive.

At 23km, my guts began to unexpectedly grumble, and I realised I might not make the aid station. A wise man once said, ""Eat before you are hungry, drink before you are thirsty, and shit before you shit yourself."" I had to take an unfortunate trip to a bush and while I had packed toilet roll it was a really bad sign. I took another immodium earlier than planned and hoped it would get things under control.

**25 - 50km**

I left the 25km feeling ok but at 30km I began to realise fatigue was setting in earlier than I had expected. I wasn't sure if this was normal tiredness, or the start of a breakdown. My heart rate still seemed under control, so I decided to take the high risk approach and keep pushing at this pace. 


I passed the marathon split in around 4:05 and the 50k in around 4:50. However, I had to admit to myself at the 50km point that things were not going well. At that checkpoint I admitted to my parents that I was probably going to reach the next checkpoints later than planned. 

At 50km I changed my hat but elected not to change any other clothes or shoes (it didn't seem to make a difference to me). I did reapply sunscreen. I also had to make another toilet stop and noticed GI discomfort starting to creep in. At this point I was still rushing through the aid stations, as much out of frustration as anything else as I knew even sub-11 would be challenging.

**50 - 75km**

I left the aid station and after a few token miles trying to keep my splits to 6:00/km (around 10:30 pace) they slipped easily to around 6:30/km. At this point I was in around 8th place. By this point the sun had came out and the day felt much hotter and more humid than we had expected. I began running with a women and an aid station volunteer told her she was the female race lead, and we were currently in the top 15. We were both surprised that the field was so slow today - previous years had been much faster - and we mused on what the reason might be.
 
By this point I had come to recognise one or two other runners and I recall complaining to them about nausea. Solid food was not going down as easily and the list of things I could eat was dwindling (it would soon reach zero). I went from eating chocolate and bananas at aid stations to drinking energy drinks and 50/50 coke and water mix.

I made it to the 3/4 point still technically on sub-11hr pace, but by this time I had to accept that I was really struggling and barely able to run. I had to apply a pre-emptive blister plaster to my heel, where my sock had worn through, but that was the least of my worries. 
 
I found myself very nauseous and unable to eat anything solid. My mother ignored the rules telling spectators to stay out of the rest areas and came to tell me I looked really ill. She had never understood why I did this sport. ""It's fine, this is normal"", I said, but I didn't believe it myself. She suggested I give up if I had to, that if I continued I only walk, and that if I needed to drop out between rest areas they could pick me up. It came from a place of love but it was very difficult to hear. I took another toilet break before I left - I had taken three immodium tabs by this point and didn't want to take more for fear of doing myself damage, but still my GI tract was rebelling. 

**75 - 100km**

I left the 75K check point in a state of dread. At this point I could barely run at 8:00/km. Before this day, I would not have believed it was possible to go this slowly and still technically be running. My gait was a strange shuffle; I felt like an 80 year-old version of myself. 

At 80km, I realised that I had blown up so badly, I might have to walk the next 25km to reach the finish. If you blow up in a marathon and have to jog in the final four miles, that's bad. But if you have to jog in the last quarter of an ultramarathon, you might be walking for four hours. That's a long time to be left licking one's wounds. 

Worse, I was struggling to take in even water without waves of nausea, let alone carbs. Could I even keep my body going for four hours without more food and calories? It would be worse than a waste to keep going at a snail's pace for two more hours, just to hit a total wall or collapse at 90K and to have to DNF anyway. 

I began to suffer a bit of a mental crisis and became quite emotional. I realised that almost every time I had tried something new in running it had gone well; even when I failed to hit a target, I would PB. This was the first time I was facing dreaded, abject, public failure. I would have to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I had failed to finish the thing I had been talking about for weeks. I realised that I had come to depend on running to make me feel strong and succesful and worthy in the eyes of others who had praised my sudden turn from fat guy to amateur endurance athlete. And here I was discovering that I was the same weak person, who struggled in every domain of life; relationships, careers, everything. I was still full of fear and doubt and I didn't even have my mediocre amateur physical achievements to cover up for it.

I had phone signal and decided to call my partner. I voiced many of these fears to her and will admit that there were a few tears. She gave me a pep talk and after ten mins of chatting I began to feel better.

Things that helped in this moment:

* An article I read here or an /r/artc about how to recover from ""bonking"" (which means something *very* different here in the UK, but anyway). I can't find it now but it contained a sentence along the lines of, ""In the worst depths of this crisis, you must have faith that you can recover. You will feel ok again and finish, and maybe even finish strong."" I knew my issues went beyond nutrition - my muscles had stopped working - but I trusted the author, an experienced professional, that if I kept going, things might improve.
* Having a new goal. No I wouldn't hit my time goals, but ""Don't DNF"" became a goal worth suffering for.
* Focussing on the positives. I shared some of my woes with an aid station volunteer, who said in passing: ""Of all the routes in the world to be stuck walking, this is a good one."" And he was right. It wasn't no longer that hot as late afternoon passed into evening. Children were playing by the river. Cows congregated in fields. Deer wandered on country estates. People on boats waved to us on the river bank. Bits of historic England popped up every few minutes. It was a nice place to be.
* I thought about Yuki Kawauchi at the Boston Marathon in 2018. Many elites dropped out in torrential rain but he kept going because he shows up to and finishes every race, and because of that he won a major title. As long as you keep showing up, you never know what might happen. I thought of a few other greats and let their examples inspire me.

Incredibly, as I kept going, things got better. My legs were restored to the point where I could coax a few mins of 7:30/km pace running out of them, followed by a couple of minutes walking. That doesn't seem like much but my watch told me it would be enough to get me a sub-12 result which would be the cherry on top of finishing. And while I was passed a few times between 80 and 90km, from 90km I didn't see anyone coming up behind me; the closer I got to the finish, the more likely it would become that I would get a result in the top 20, which became an additional incentive to keep going.

### Post-race
At 5km I was just about able to sustain a gentle trot. I crossed the finish before it got dark and hugged my parents. I was very quickly overcome with a case of the shakes and coldness. I wrapped up warm and drank hot, sugary tea. I failed to stretch or really do anything except clamber in the car and sleep on the way home; I would not recommend this.

### What I learned

* Most importantly, I learned my limits as a person. In the depths of my crisis at 75K, I realised I had pushed so hard at the start of the race because I needed this result to be special, to make up for other perceived failings in my life. In that moment by the riverbank by myself, my legs were gone and I couldn't run at all. I had nothing left but failure, and I was faced with the fact that I am riddled with weakness. And it was fine. I learned to accept that about myself and be at peace. The next time I go for a run or enter a race I will still be ambitious and excited about what I can achieve, but I don't think I will be doing it to feed my fragile pride. Maybe I can do it with greater modesty, humility and ultimately a greater sense of joy.
* I understand now what my different levels of exhaustion are. I know that if I feel a certain way at 30km it's time to slow down. 
* I also learned that time works differently in an ultra. A few extra mins of walking here and there, or a few mins extra at an aid station getting ready for the next leg (applying lubricant, taking care of blisters, digesting, catching up with supporters, etc), can make you much faster in the long run.
* I learned a lot about the limits of my GI tract. No caffeine except maybe in the final couple of hours of a longer race. I sabotaged myself badly by drinking coffee and using caffeinated gels. For me, it's fine in a three hour marathon. Anything longer and it's just laying dynamite which will blow up later.

### What's next
An easy week off to let tendons recover with maybe a few slow miles here and there. I am tempted to train for shorter distances (5, 10 and half marathons) before taking a run at Boston, assuming my qualifier from last year gets me in once I have graduated into the next age bracket.

### Final words
Thank you to the running community on this sub and beyond for all the inspiration and learning. You tried to warn me but I had to learn this lesson the hard way. Although I feel humbled and a little bit sad I didn't post a better time, I think this experience has made me a wiser runner and person in the long run.

Right now I am trying to slowly build up my miles starting at 20 miles a week and adding 3-5 per week. Are there any other activities I can do to speed up the process? Should I do cycling workouts as doubles or is there a point of diminishing returns ?",1631568955
AdvancedRunning,RaiseRuntimeError,Fast half marathon fueling and hydration strategy.,"This weekend i will be running the San Francisco half marathon and because of COVID accommodations water stations are ""bring your own cup."" Since i plan on getting around 1:15-1:17, running around with my own cup for a sip of water doesn't really sound practical. Normally I would take a Gu and some water before the race and some time after the half way mark i would get some water or Gatorade for a little pick me up. Since this isn't really an option i was planning on having just the Gu before the race and going the rest of the race without any water/Gatorade. Reading [this article](https://www.podiumrunner.com/nutrition/race-fuel/do-you-need-to-fuel-during-the-half-marathon/) i don't think there will be any determent to my performance but i was wondering how other fast half marathoners fuel for their races especially when they cant really get the hydration or fueling because its a big hectic race or COVID restrictions. This also gets me thinking about my marathon in December where hydration and fueling will be much more important, i am assuming there will be similar issues to solve.

### Training
I followed Pfitzinger 12/47, moved around a few workouts but otherwise followed it to a T. I raced my first 10K as one of my prescribed tune-up races in 42:25, which left me feeling confident. Last year I raced my first marathon in 3:32. I want to run a marathon in 3:10 which would qualify me for Chicago on time. Another marathon was not in the cards for me this year, for a variety of reasons. I viewed this race as a stepping stone towards that goal in the future, possibly next year. This was my first half marathon, so my biggest concern going into the race was getting my pace right. 

### Pre-race
Pretty standard. The night before I went out for a pasta dinner, did yoga, then went to bed. Slept pretty good. Morning of the race I had a cup of coffee, a banana, and some Tailwind. Ran a 3/4 mile warmup jog. 

### Race
I definitely went out faster than I intended to, but luckily it wasn’t stupidly fast. I felt really good like I was comfortably cruising at a slightly quick pace. I knew the course had a big uphill from roughly 5-8 and was pleasantly surprised with how I did through that stretch. I rode the downhill through mile 9… and then started to have some trouble. You can see I definitely struggled through the final couple miles, but nothing too damaging to my overall performance. I felt like I crushed my true goal time of 1:35 and finished 12th overall / 3rd in my age group. 

### Post-race
Really happy with my performance! My real goal was 7:15, I just slapped 7:00 down as a stretch goal. Being so close at 7:01 was a great shock, I really did not think that was in the realm of possibility. I am hoping to continue on my two-part running goals of running sub-3 in the Chicago marathon (and qualifying for it on time first). My wife is due with our second child this month, so my racing is likely done for the year, but it was a great note to end on until 2022!

I suck at recovering from these strains. I feel like this is a weird thing to be bad at. Your body just heals itself -- right? But seriously, I'm terrible.

It usually takes me a month (sometimes more) to get back to where I was after a minor strain. I follow all of the standard advice, e.g.

* RICE the first 48 hours
* avoid stretching the area
* roll adjacent areas
* prioritize sleep
* see a running-specific PT
* take a couple weeks off
* etc

but _every_ time without exception I end up with lingering pain that has me second guessing whether it's safe to get back. ""What if it's not done healing? I don't want to rip the scar tissue and make it worse. I guess I'll just take another week off.""

I've followed ""return to running"" programs in the past, but those are geared toward grade 2+ strains and more serious injuries. It shouldn't take 4+ weeks of alternating running/walking to get back to running full time after a minor strain.

I've only raced one road half marathon (7:03/mi for 1:32 in 2016 using Pfitz something) and based on that I'm hopeful that if I did a proper marathon training cycle I could run 8min miles and finish in around 3:30. This isn't the situation I'm in for tomorrow though.

I was thinking I might try to set out in 9 minute miles to aim to finish in around 4 hours. My guess is at this pace I'll feel good at the half and suffer starting at some point in the second half. Temperatures should be 60F at the start and high 70s at the end.

Does this sound like a good plan or should I pace differently? More conservatively or more aggressively?

I'm not trying to optimize performance but rather support my larger training cycle. My next recovery week is three weeks away and next workout is four days away.

--

Added to appease the moderators: recent workouts include two 1hr30min runs, the first including 3x8 LT intervals (~7:30-8min mi) and the latter with 2x30 SSR intervals (~8-8:30min mi). Pacing varied because of hills. The first run covered 10mi and the second was 9.5, the difference because the second route was hillier.

Last weekend I ran a 12mi road race finishing in 1:31 on a net downhill course.",1631281262

AdvancedRunning,CosmotheSloth,Running a sub-3 marathon with a hydration pack,"Hi everyone,

I was hoping to gain some insight from the community about whether people believe it's a good idea or even doable to run a sub-3 marathon with a hydration pack on.

I've got my marathon in just over 4 weeks and as it's been so warm throughout the past 12 weeks that I've been training, I've been using a hydration vest on (Inov8 vest with 2 x 500 mL soft flask with tubes attached) to keep my fluids up. I was aware this might hamper me slightly during training but nonetheless I've been able to do my training plan and the big session fairly well and I've been running my target marathon pace (~4:10 min/km) with the vest and water in tow. The other advantage is that the pack lets me carry my gels for the runs too (which I want to be able to do in the marathon).

I guess my question is has anyone run a sub-3 marathon carrying this type of load and if so would you recommend it? Or is it worth running as light as possible and just grabbing water at the water stations during the race?

During most of my longer, hotter runs I've been getting through all the water I'm carrying which makes me concerned that I'd need that on race day but I'm also aware that I'm probably making my life a lot harder.

Any comments are much appreciated and thanks in advance!",1631266316

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Food/Body issues are making me not enjoy running anymore.,"So I just ate 4 Oreos &amp; a ton of chocolate &amp; a bunch of random things following my burger and fries from the dining hall. I'm a D3 runner and I've always been a bit on the ""heavier"" side for distance running (22.7 BMI) but I probably look 5 pounds less than I weigh due to muscle. I currently feel like I'm a bottomless pit and go through periods where I'm completely ravenous. I've definitely pigged out in the past and it didn't bother me, but lately it really is. I just have a fear of gaining weight and getting slower, yet I keep eating. I wish I was at home and not at this all you can eat dining hall that either has salads or unhealthy (but delicious) crap. I have no self control and it irritates me to no end. Even if I close my eyes as I walk by the desserts I just end up feasting when I get back to my dorm on the snacks my mom sent me with. I have to force myself to go to the library but all I think about is food. It's not always like this, though - this week I've been especially hungry, but it was because I restricted for 3 days following a terrible race. See, restricting food is my coping mechanism, and I'd like to change that. I wish I could just eat intuitively again and not have food occupy so much brain space.

I've always compared myself to others. Why are my legs so bulky, is that why I'm slow? I've noticed that the thinner runners are often not bothered by the heat, yet I have so much trouble moving myself along. Some girls talk about how others make fun of them for being too skinny and how they've tried all their life to gain weight and I want to to cry because I would give anything to be in their shoes. I'm close to ""overweight"" and getting nowhere with running. I haven't felt good on a run since this track season when I PRd in the mile. I just feel so sluggish and I know some of it's in my head, but I feel like my eating habits are the cause. 

Throughout high school, I went through periods where I'd ""restrict"" for a week but I never made it long enough. I'd get ""inspired"" by the weight loss stories leading to much faster times. I just can't get myself to start again because I hate feeling hungry. I get headaches. I can't think. Yet sometimes it's so tempting. No ones there to watch how much I'm eating.

Now I'm close to crying because I ate way too much today. I've normally been a pretty consistent runner but I've had a terrible season so far. I bet if I weighed myself I'd be 3-4 pounds heavier and I'd honestly not know what to do. I feel like I eat way more than everyone else. Every day I want to start over and eat proper meals and less snacks but usually it never works. I still feel guilty after every meal. 

TLDR: I am terrified of gaining weight and getting even slower.",1631248609

AdvancedRunning,DonalG45,Jumping rope - Transfer to running,"Curious to get some opinions/stories of results on jumping rope as a cross-training tool or a stand-in for running when a person is unable to run.

My story:
I'm currently about halfway through a 2 week period in hotel quarantine, having recently emigrated to Australia.
I had a jump rope lying around at home and brought it with me, just in case I was unable to get any other exercise equipment (originally planned to get an exercise bike for the room).
After a couple of days jumping rope, I decided to forget about any other equipment and just focus on getting better at jumping rope.
I've done a short workout most days, usually consisting of 10 x 2 minute rounds, with 1 minute rest between rounds (so about 30 mins total workout time)
During these workouts, my heart rate is averaging out to about 160bpm, very similar to the average I get on an easy run.
I've also noticed some muscle soreness (the good kind ;) ) in my calves and feet and I wonder will working these muscle groups have some good transfer to faster running where getting up on the balls of the feet is more applicable. 
It has been a while since I've done any races but I reckon I was in about 21-22 minute 5k shape prior to emigrating. I've signed up for a 5k race the day after I get out of quarantine, so I'll update this post after and let you know what difference, if any, the jumping rope has made for me personally.

Looking forward to hearing any of your stories/experience with it!",1631240408

AdvancedRunning,orangecatfan,Recap/Results: 'Best of' Diamond League Championships,"*\[copy/paste of a write-up I self-published a few minutes ago in case it's of interest. spoiler warning: results from this week's Diamond League championships mentioned.\]*

The **Wanda Diamond League** concluded its 2021 season this week with a two-day championship meet in Zürich, Switzerland. Across 32 diamond events, professional track and field athletes competed for championship titles, which came with a $30,000 award, a Diamond Trophy and a wild-card entry to compete in the 2022 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon. The championship meet kicked-off yesterday, Wed. Sep. 8 with seven diamond finals, then resumed today with another 25 events.

Similar to last week’s Diamond League meet in Brussels, the **men’s 400m** opened the track part of today’s program with a neck-to-neck photo finish between American **Michael Cherry** and Tokyo bronze medalist **Kirani James** of Grenada. Cherry edged out James by .01 second, clocking a time of  44.41 to grab the win and a ticket to next summer’s World Championships.

Tokyo silver medalist **Anzhelika Sidorova** of Russia made a historical showing in the **women’s pole vault**. Sidorova secured herself a Diamond Trophy upon clearing 4.77m, then continued to match each bar raise until she surpassed 5.01m, becoming the third woman to ever break the five-meter barrier.

Tokyo gold medalist and fastest woman alive **Elaine Thompson-Herah** of Jamaica lined up for the **women’s 100m**, alongside Great Britain’s **Dina Asher-Smith**, who sought to end the season on a positive note after failing to qualify for the event final in Tokyo. Thompson-Herah clocked 10.65 in a  resounding win, while Asher-Smith ran her fastest time of the season  (10.87), grabbing second place.

Following Thompson-Herah’s win, four of the fastest sprinters in the world lined up for the **men’s 100m**: Americans **Fred Kerley**, **Trayvon Bromell** and **Ronnie Baker**, and Canada’s **Andre De Grasse**.  Following recent Diamond League wins in Brussels and Paris, Kerley delivered once again with a winning time of 9.87, edging out De Grasse by two hundredths of a second. De Grasse clocked a personal best (9.89), while Baker finished third (9.91).

Both the men’s and women’s 1500m ended in showdowns between the events’ top-two ranked athletes in the world.

In the **women’s 1500m**, the event’s Tokyo gold medalist **Faith Kipyegon** of Kenya out-kicked bronze medalist **Sifan Hassan** at the finish, winning in 3:58.33. Hassan placed second (3:58.55), while American **Josette Norris** finished third (4:00.41) — a significant rebound for the middle-distance runner who failed to qualify for the Olympics after finishing 8th in the women’s 5000m at U.S. trials.

In similar fashion, Tokyo silver medalist **Timothy Cheruiyot** of Kenya won the **men’s 1500m** in 3:31.37, slightly edging out Olympic champion **Jakob Ingebrigtsen** of Norway, who clocked 3:31.45. Australian **Stewart McSweyn** placed third (3:32.14).

In stride with what emerged as the theme of the day —  down-to-the-wire-races-between-the-bests — the men and women’s 200m delivered neck-to-neck finishes that were too close for broadcast  commentators to make initial, naked eye calls on who won.

Jamaica’s **Shericka Jackson** barreled down the final meters of the **women’s 200m** with a promising lead, but was out-kicked by Namibia’s **Christine Mboma**, who won in 21.78, breaking the U20 world record. Jackson placed second with a lifetime best of 21.81. Just over an hour after placing second in  the women’s 100m, Great Britain’s **Dina Asher-Smith** clocked 22.19 and added a third-place finish to her record.

The **men’s 200m** served up a rematch between the event’s Tokyo gold medalist **Andre De Grasse** (Canada) and silver medalist **Kenny Bednareck** (USA), as well as **Fred Kerley** (USA), who won over Bednareck in Paris two weeks ago. With perhaps ‘fresh legs’ as an advantage over his main competitors, Bednareck outran De  Grasse by two hundredths of a second, winning in 19.70. De Grasse placed second (19.72), while Kerley finished third (19.83).

American **Devon Allen** — who finished fourth in the Tokyo final — continued his post-Olympic hot streak in the **men’s 110m hurdles**, winning over medalists Hansle Parchment and Ron Levy of Jamaica. Allen and Levy both clocked times of 13.06, but the American crossed the line first by the smallest fraction of a second.

Yesterday, in her most significant match since failing to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics at U.S. trials, American **Maggie Ewen** won the **women’s shot put**, grabbing her first Diamond Trophy and a spot to compete in the 2022 World Championships — a world-class competition with stringent qualification standards as competitive as the Olympics (if not more).

While some athletes ended the season in Zürich by making up for disappointments in Tokyo — whether it was failure to win, medal or qualify — several Olympic gold medalists reaffirmed resounding dominance over their respective events.

Olympic champions **Pedro Pichardo** of Portugal and **Yulimar Rojas** of Venezuela delivered commanding wins in the **men’s** and **women’s triple jump**, with Rojas setting a new meet record of 15.48m.

In the **women’s** and **men’s high jump**, Tokyo gold medalists **Mariya Lasitskene** of Russia and **Gianmarco Tamberi** of Italy added another championship title to their collections, making  uncontested clearances at 2.05m and 2.34m respectively. Lasitskene broke the meet record and set a new world leading mark.

Olympic champions **Ryan Crouser** and **Valarie Allman** of the USA brought home their first Diamond Trophies, winning the **men’s shot put** (22.67m, meet record) and **women’s discus throw** (69.20m) respectively.

Looking strong down the final homestretch of the **men’s 400m hurdles**, world record holder **Karsten Warholm** of Norway won in 47.35.

Two common pieces of advise for optimal running from Daniel's book is to run at 180 steps per min and to breathe with the 2-2 cycle (2 steps: breathe in, 2 steps: breathe out). 

I find this breathing method SO fast and unnatural, I am wondering if you guys manage to run like this? At this pace, I feel that my breathing cannot be deep enough at all and am wondering why it is considered optimal.

Is it better to go for quick breath or deeper breath for racing a distance such as the HM?",1631223743

### Training
I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

### Pre-race
Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

### Race
There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them ~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

### Post-race
Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

I had not run more than two miles straight in at least nine years. My longest run ever was maybe 11 miles. I ran 800m in HS and got really into 5k in my 20s for a while. 5'10"" 175 decent general fitness.

You're thinking ""no way in hell,"" right? Or at least, ""half is doable but it's gonna hurt . . . full not so much."" That's what I said in July too.

But I jumped my mpw from 0-40 in 3 weeks (I'm an idiot), didn't get hurt (much . . . I'm a lucky idiot) and have stayed there, structuring workouts off JD blue plan modified for my work schedule. On Sunday I ran 90-95% effort 5k TT in 22:30. Walk recovery for a few minutes and then mile cooldown.  Full day of rest and yesterday I did my last long run before the half.

Well it was supposed to be a long run. It turned into a negative split 1:53 HM and I felt froggy so finished out 30k in 2:45. I was fasted except for two scoops of Gatorade endurance 20 min before and one Honey Stinger @ 60 minutes. Avg HR was under 160. Legs felt great and still do today.

Now I have this crazy notion that I could not only run a marathon next month, but have a shot of doing it in a semi-respectable time say 4:00-4:15. And be able to walk the next day.

Please tell me (1) I'm an idiot and to save my entry fee or (2) I'm an idiot and the best way to approach this. I was thinking just stay at 40-50 mpw but all easy runs, condensed into longer runs in fewer days. 

If the honest answer is ""no, you're most likely gonna croak at 20 miles, even if you go out at 10 minute splits,"" I appreciate the candor. I have no interest in being on the road for 5+ hours.",1631151799

AdvancedRunning,ThatRunnerDude15,Super shoe durability,"I’ve had a pair of carbon plated “super shoes” (adidas Adizero adios Pro 2) for a couple months now and put in about 25 miles of work with em. So obviously not much at all. While I love em and want to lace em up every time I hop into faster stuff either on the track or a long road workout, I hesitate to for a couple reasons:

1. A lot of money shelled out to just blow through em. 
2. Not sure how many miles they’ll be able to handle before needing to be retired from racing/speed work.

I was wondering if anyone else has any idea or experience on how long they “should” last in terms of durability, whether it’s the adidas or Nike or Sauconys or a different brand’s plated shoe.

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Threshold-Long-Threshold (TLT)**.

*History:*

Workout of Clara Peterson (coached by Magdalena Lewy Boulet), 16th at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials

*Why:*

To satisfy two workouts in one session [a long run and a threshold-paced run]! This is a demanding session, but with great benefits. The inclusion of threshold running in the middle of 20-mile runs forces the running muscles to use up glycogen stores more rapidly than they would when running easy 20 miles.

*How:*

Run 20 minutes easy for a warm-up. Then run 3 x 15 minutes at your tempo pace (15 seconds faster per mile than your goal marathon pace) with 3 minutes rest between repeats. Then run 60 minutes easy and follow that with a final set of 15 minutes at tempo pace. Conclude the workout with 20 minutes of easy running. This will provide two hours and 40 minutes of quality running and prepare you well physically and mental for marathon race day.

AdvancedRunning,Yaverland,100km ultramarathon - Choosing a goal time,"M35 gearing up for my first 100km race this Saturday. I need help choosing a goal time.

The course is along the Thames river from London to Henley. It is flat albeit a very gradual upward climb. It is set to be warm during the late morning and afternoon but not scorching. 

I am considering targetting sub 9 hours, which means running at about 5:20/km (8:38/mile) with a little extra time for aid station stops. This is slower than all my typical training runs except the odd lazy recover run. B goal would be to keep pace below 5:30/km.

Relevant training info:

*Currently doing an average of 80km a week, peaking at 100km last week.
*Very recently did a HM in 1:27 at a brisk pace, but not flat out. I think I could have gone under 1:25 if I had pushed. 
*Recent 5K in 18:45.
*Recent training runs include a marathon last weekend in 3:40m with around 32km at 4:50-*5:00/km. This felt ok but I was a bit wiped by the end.
* I have done a few 50km+ runs, including a 75km trail run with 1500m elevation. But the most comparable was a flat riverside 50K (my first ultra) which I did in 4hr17. This was three months ago and early into my return from injury and I feel a am a lot stronger since then.
*I had to take time out for injury late last year until around March (plantar fasciitis) and have been building back since. 
*This time last year I was running 100-130km a week. I hit a marathon PR of 2:56 on a flat course in bad conditions. Tune up races were a ten mile of 62 mins and a 10K of 36:40. Earlier in the year I did 5K in 17:50 and a HM in under 1:23. I am not at this level right now but getting back there.

I’m a 38 year old male training for my first marathon in November. I started training in June by signing up for Hal Higdon’s Intermediate 2 marathon training plan. The plan has been a blessing for me as it provides structured workout which is dynamic and helps me stay focused for my target goal of finishing the race in 4 hours.

I foam roll after long runs and  stretch as well. Lately, I have this dull pain in my right leg below the knee, outer side (could be soleus or pernoeus Longus or tibial). It’s hard to point the exact source, and I can’t tell if it’s muscle or nerve. Sorry, I know this sounds awfully vague.

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Opinions on negative splits with 5k/6k? Experiences?,"I was going to try to aim for negative splits during my next race (6k). I used to be in shape to run a 21 min 5k PR where my first mile was always the fastest around 6:35, but recently I had a horrible race and split a 6:45 - 7:08 - 10:29 (walked). I want to aim for a sub 27 minute 6k (distance changes next race) by starting around 7:15-7:20, and then working down from there. I'm going to talk to my coach, but is this too slow to start out? 

The reason I'm asking is I was looking at past results for this race where they gave the breakdown splits and it seemed like it was common for the first mile to even be a minute faster than the second. I really don't want to put myself through that kind of pain, even though I know that all my 5k PRs have been from positive splitting (yet my half marathon and 10k PRs are from negative). Everyone who finished around 26:50 for the 6k seemed to go out in 6:45 which is 30 sec faster than I was planning..... Does that even make sense? If so, I'm a little worried. What happens if I start out at 7:15 and can't really get down from there, but instead go SLOWER? How can I be patient with negative splits....?",1631030320

### Training

Training has been pretty bumpy, to say the least... I started training seriously around the start of 2021, after having spent close to a year just doing easy running and stagnating. Followed the Pfitz 12/63 half marathon plan up until a time trial in late May, where I was going for 1:25 (with a PB at the time of \~1:35). I ended up DNFing the TT at 9.5 miles; a combination of poor planning (hot sun, and a busy park as I started late), and psyching myself out. A week later, I reattempted the TT with a modified goal of sub 1:30, finishing in 1:28:02.

I was planning on taking a couple of weeks to run an ultra and recover, then heading into Pfitz 12/70 for the Manchester marathon in October. I pushed myself to do too much too soon, and stopped the Pfitz plan after just 2.5 weeks, feeling pretty burned out of running in general. Took a week or two of only running when I actively wanted to, then started again with just trying to hit around 50-60 miles per week, with two track sessions per week at a local athletics club that I recently joined, and long runs in preparation for the marathon. After the marathon I'm planning to focus on improving my 1 mile/5k/10k times for a while, so I figured I'd just enjoy the marathon and see how it went. My PB is 3:28 which was an impulse marathon extended from a 20 miler where I had no nutrition or water, so I knew I'd easily break it regardless.

Originally my target was sub 3 for the marathon, which I adjusted to 3:10 after the failed TT, and adjusted to ""get a PB"" after stopping the Pfitz plan, but relaxing the pressure on myself allowed me to enjoy training again, so I began to think about some more ambitious goals again.

In short, I had no idea of my current fitness. I thought it had gone way downhill, but I felt good hitting similar splits to when I was at peak fitness at track sessions. With the marathon on October 10th approaching fast, I wanted to race a half to see where I'm at and set some targets accordingly. I entered a purportedly flat half marathon a few miles from where I live to set a benchmark.

### Pre-race

The race was due to start at 9am. I woke up at 6am and ate a large bowl of oats with soya milk and maple syrup, with some black coffee and a pint and a half of water to flush it down. I need the bathroom a lot when I'm nervous, so gave myself plenty of time to get that out of my system before leaving the house at 7:45 for the 15 minute bike ride to the start line. Attached my timing chip and number, couple more toilet trips and a warm up, and I was ready to go. I joined the 1:25-1:30 section of the starting pen. I'd outwardly said I was just going to go for a 1:30, but was feeling pretty confident that I was fit enough for a PB.

### Race

Being a fairly small race, the start went very smoothly - arranged by finish time and socially distanced at the start, so I was immediately in a group of runners going around my pace. The start was between the Olympic stadium and some skyscrapers, so I didn't expect my watch to be accurate; I just planned to use the mile markers, start at 6:45/mile (4:10/km) and see how it went.

The course was a wiggly one, with a full half marathon packed into a pretty small park. There were several 180 degree turns, and whilst I wouldn't call it hilly, there were a good number of short but steep climbs, making it not the easiest course I've ever done. The first mile, however, was pretty flat, and I went through the mark in 6:19. Way faster than what I'd planned, but not too much faster than my dream goal of sub 1:25. I decided to reign it in and stay comfortable for now. My watch said that the first mile was short, as well, so I decided that I was likely actually on around PB pace.

After another mile, I got the sense that I'd been too cautious off the start. I came through in 6:32 feeling very comfortable, even for mile 2 of a half marathon. I'd settled into a small group, and the group ahead of us was slowly pulling away, so I decided to go with them.

Miles 3 through to 8 felt amazing. I felt better than I had at the same point in previous half marathons, and was slowly picking people off one by one. The miles kept coming up slightly short on my watch, and I had decided in advance to trust the markers over my watch, so I just assumed the wiggly route and occasional underpass had got the better of the GPS. I was flying past people though, particularly in miles 7 and 8; I knew that if the splits were to be trusted I was on for low 1:20s at this point and should smash even my most ambitious target time.

Around the end of mile 8 I started to feel the sting. I'd been gradually escalating my effort over the last few miles to pass people, so I decided to just hold on until the end now. I didn't feel like I'd really slowed down, so was surprised to see a split time 25 seconds slower than the last one at the end of mile 9. It was still faster than 1:25 pace, though, so I figured I'd just roll with it and hope I could hang on.

Miles 10 and 11 were a constant battle with myself to hold onto the pace and ignore the part of me that was saying I'd done enough and to settle for a PB. Thankfully, around the start of this part, I'd caught up with a woman who was pushing hard, and matching someone stride for stride was all that got me through this part. Mile 11 felt a bit faster, but it was at this point that I realised the mile markers were definitely off; a 5:51 would be one of the fastest miles I've ever run, and I wasn't breaking any speed records at this stage.

With 2.1 miles to go I edged away from the woman I was running with, and towards a fairly long incline that we'd done near the start of the race. Up here I felt like I was seriously fading, and I twice overtook a guy who stopped to walk for a few seconds before racing ahead of me again. Fastest run/walk half marathon I've ever seen! The 12 mile marker was just after another 180 degree turn, and I went through in 6:47.

I did a bit of mental maths at this stage (which I've since realised was very wrong) and decided I needed to do the last 1.1 miles in 7:30 to be able to break 1:25. This was going to be a push, but I just had to not fade any more. However, we were now doing the reverse of a section of the course we'd done at the start, and I knew that it was more than 0.1 miles to the 1 mile marker. Fueled by anger about the bad mile markers, I pushed around the corner and up around the stadium again.

It became clear that the last 1.1 was much further than 1.1 miles, and that I wasn't going to do it in under 7:30. I was seriously pissed off at myself now. In my head, I'd messed up the pacing and missed a good shot at sub 1:25, so I lost focus and didn't push it as hard as I should have for the last half a mile. I mustered up a bit of a kick for the last 100m, but thought I was coming over the line in about 1:26, so was very confused to see that the time was 10:24:24 as I crossed the line.

### Post-race

I crossed the line very confused and sat down on a bench with a couple of bottles of water and a flapjack for a few minutes. I was too tired to understand what had happened at this point. I was pleased with a PB, but didn't really dare to believe I'd hit the 1:25, even though my watch said I'd only been running for less than that. I cycled home with my girlfriend after a lot of water, then checked the results, and it was only then that the time sunk in. The rest of the day I pretty much just ate, had a nap, went for a short walk, and felt very pleased with myself.

Clearly a slightly inconsistent couple of months hasn't wiped out the 6 months of quality training I had beforehand. I've got 5 weeks until the marathon, and whilst I'd love to convert this half time into a sub 3, I don't think I've really done the training to back it up. I certainly perform better in longer distances (my 10k and HM times are much better than my 5k and 1 mile times), but I've not really done any marathon pace workouts in my long runs, and don't really have time to build up that endurance fitness much.

Furthermore, I've never raced a marathon. I've jogged one with friends (4:40), run one alone as a long easy run (3:28) and done a 50k trail race, so I'm fine with the distance, but have never run fast for longer than a half. Given this, and the general tendency for younger men to underperform in marathons relative to shorter distances, I'm aiming for 3:05-3:10. If anyone thinks this is too ambitious or too conservative, or has any advice for a first fast marathon, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed!

AdvancedRunning,xalendrio,Just finished my first Half and want to build up to Marathon,"Hello guys,

Yesterday I just ran my first half marathon in competition, after a bit more than a year of consistent running. It was my first big running objective, aimed for a sub 1h30 and did 1h29', so really happy. Above all, I just loved the experience from preparation to race day, and really can't wait to head towards my next objective. 

Actually, I already have in mind the Paris Marathon planned in early april 2022. I know it's quite a long time from now but I have some questions about my approach to this new goal.

1) I often hear that one should consider running a marathon after at least 2 years or so of consistent running. Although I am really excited about going for a 42km, I don't want to rush it and don't want it to be destructive physically and/or mentally, as I'm conscious running this distance is not harmless. And I realize I am not that experienced as a runner. Actually, I was a competitive cyclist in my youth but totally got out of sports for several years before coming back more than a year ago. So: is it too soon to think about a marathon?

2) What would be a reasonable objective given my HM time and my running experience? I think I could aim for a sub 3h30, but could I be more ambitious?

3) Most marathon training plans seem to extend over 12 weeks, that is January to March for the race I have in mind. How should I train until then, in order to begin this preparation in the best possible conditions?

4) I also have other sporting objectives for the next year. Indeed, I also got into triathlon this year and completed one short distance. I plan to race some other tris in summer 2022 and build up to Olympic distance. But I am a bit terrible at swimming and would really want to swim consistently this winter. Does it seem reasonable to pursue these two objectives in parallel, knowing that I will have only a few weeks to recover from the marathon and head towards my tri season? 

To add a few precisions, I am really willing to invest effort and time in those objectives. I already ran 4 times a week for my HM preparation, and consistently had at least 6 activities with swimming and cycling sessions.

I would be thankful for any insight",1630929036

## Training

Training for this race was a little less specific and focused than I typically like. I have raced a few times this summer, all with varying distances and difficulties. I have done a hilly trail 50km in June, a mountainous trail half marathon in early July, and a flat road half marathon at the end of July. The intermittent racing over a variety of distances didn't set me up very well to have the proper buildup and micro-cycling that I like in my training. Oh well. On the upside, I've been doing heftier long runs earlier than usual in the season because of the race schedule. 

About 3.5 weeks prior to the Marquette Marathon I had to bail on some longer workouts and long runs because of an issue in my lower calf and ankle, so in the last month-ish I didn't have a long run over 18 miles in length. My workouts under about 13 miles in length have been solid, however. Two key workouts that helped me maintain confidence in myself came \~2 weeks before the race. I did 5 x (1 mile at half marathon pace, 1/2 mile float) on a hot and humid morning. I averaged 5:38/mile for the miles and averaged 6:20/mile for the float. The next workout was 8 x 1km with every other km being 20 seconds faster. I averaged 3:00/km on the hard ones and 3:20/km on the easy ones. I felt so strong in both workouts. Light, fast, effortless. I figured that despite the lack of long runs I would be okay for the marathon. 

## Pre-race

Nothing out of the ordinary here. I woke up 2 hours before the race start, ate a few bagels, had some coffee, and rolled my muscles before leaving the house. It's best not to overthink things on race day. It's nice to live in Marquette because I got to sleep in my own bed and get dropped off at the start by my girlfriend. It was spitting rain all morning, so I warmed up in a raincoat and pants.

## Race

I haven't had this much fun during a race in quite a long time! The Marquette Marathon serves as a fund raiser for the local college, Northern Michigan University, so the race directors recruit the school's athletes to man aid stations, road crossings, and the finish line. As an NMU alum myself (I graduated in 2020), I knew quite a few workers out on the course. In fact, the lead bikers were two of my best friends on the school's nordic ski team. I train with them frequently, so the race just felt like a routine long run with them. They were cracking jokes, keeping me company, holding my bottles, and making sure I got the proper fuel from the aid stations. Having my training partners on bikes with me felt a little unfair at times, but there are no rules against stuff like this at such a small race. 

I was in the lead right from the gun and cruising pretty comfortably at roughly 6-flat pace over some rolling hills in the first 8 miles of the race. The course is exclusively on a bike path that goes from the town of Ishpeming to Marquette. It's pretty fun because Ishpeming sits about 900 feet in elevation above Marquette, so miles 10 - 17 are all downhill. You lose about 100 ft/mile over this period, so it's a nice break on the cardiovascular system but it's a little tough on the legs if you aren't prepared. I could feel my calf flair up a little bit around mile 14, but it wasn't bad enough to slow me down. 

There was only one other runner with me during the race, but he was consistently just 10m behind me (odd choice) until mile 20 when he started to fall off. The last 6 miles are perfectly flat along Lake Superior but include one \~100ft hill with about 3 miles to go. After the long downhill to reach Marquette, the flats and even the little hill felt nice on the legs. It's amazing how a slight change in your form affects your body. I did end up having a few slower miles in the final 1/4 of the race, but it wasn't enough to take me out of the race. This is probably due to my lack of proper long runs in the last month or so. I've also found that you need to actively try and accelerate during the final miles in a marathon just to keep your same pace. I was pushing really hard at this point and focusing on my form just to hold off any cramping that could happen. I love getting to this point in races. It's a single-minded pursuit to the finish line. 

I crossed the line in 2:39:08 and was greeted by a bunch of my friends who were working the event. I also found out that the winner from the half marathon ran 1:06 (hot damn!) so it was fun to chat with him for a while. 

## Post-race

Beer, shower, snack, awards ceremony, nachos, nap. In that order. The rain finally stopped by mid-afternoon so by the evening I was ready to walk around town with some friends and grab a few more drinks. Great day all-in-all!

## Training

I'm currently at the tail-end of a Pfitzinger 18/70 plan for the London Marathon.  This race lined-up nicely with the final 'tune-up' race, and was just down the road from me, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Maybe I could come in with a finish time that was a 'safe' predictor of going sub-3 at London.

I re-jigged a few scheduled workouts to fit this one in: moving the long run to earlier in the week, and hoped that having a few recovery runs later in the week would rest the legs enough that they wouldn't blow-up in the later miles.  Although I was hoping for a sub 1:25 time, I wanted to keep in mind that this wasn't my A-race, it was just an elaborate training run. No need to go all-in...

## Race

The course is a 13.1 mile loop around Southampton.  There are half and full marathons run concurrently, with the full marathon being two laps.

The course itself is fairly flat, with most of the 500ft/150m elevation in 3 climbs.

## Miles 0-3

The start was a bit of a mess.  Both the half and the full marathons started at the same time, in a massed start, with no timing pens.  I was fortunate to be near the front, but the first half a mile was cluttered and claustrophobic while the various pace groups emerged.  I spent most of the first mile swerving around people and trying to keep out of other people's way until things cleared.  I found myself in a group of people doing 6:00 min miles.  It felt comfy, but I thought it was a bit ambitious so dialled the pace back to \~06:15.  Still too fast but I was enjoying myself.

These miles took us through the centre, past the docks and into the first big climb - up over the Itchen Bridge.  Whilst not a big climb really, the bridge looms up in front of you and looks pretty daunting.

This also had one of the more surreal moments of the race: a group of cheerleaders on one side of the road - waving pom-poms and doing a routine - and a bunch of anti-vaccination protesters with conspiracy placards on the other.

I used the climb to slow myself down to my target pace of 06:20-25.  This only lasted until the peak, then I was back to 06:15.

## Miles 4-6

This section looped us past the waterfront, through some residential areas and then back over the bridge. I spent a large chunk of this section trading places with one of the marathoners - they were looking stronger than I was feeling, and I hope they kept it up until the end.

Try as I might, I couldn't settle into my goal pace. If I tried to hit it I'd either slow to 06:40, or speed to 05:50 pace.  Eventually I conceded to the momentum and decided to hold 06:15 - I'd deal with any fall-out later on. I was going to go all-in.

## Miles 7-9

The early fast miles and the heat of the day were starting to make themselves felt in this section.  It was also pretty tedious - through industrial estates and arterial roads (and another few clusters of anti-vaccination nutters) - the only highlight being a run through Southampton FC's stadium (I'm not a Saints fan, but it was still a nice experience).

I settled in with a loose group of 3-4 runners. We ate up these miles, trading places occasionally and pressing each other to keep the pace going.  I could feel the things slipping a bit, but I knew that there was one more climb to go, so didn't want to push too hard too early. These were my slowest and toughest miles.

## Miles 10-13.1

This section took us through a park alongside the river - which was wonderfully shady and breezy - before a mile-long climb and a loop back down through the Southampton Common to the finish line.

Somewhere in the park I pulled ahead of the group I was in, but there was no-one visible in front of me.  These were some really lonely miles.  The support from spectators here was fantastic and really worked wonders for keeping me going through the climb. Although I slowed, I remained in-touch with my revised goal pace of 06:15.

At the top of Southampton Common I hit that magical point where you realise that you've done it - you no longer need to keep anything in reserve.  I picked up the pace and just emptied the tanks to take me to the finish line.  Again, the support here was amazing - especially in the last few hundred metres - everyone cheering and banging on the railings spurred me to a sprint finish, despite the exhaustion in my legs.

Chip time: 1:22:38

## Post-race

Very pleased with that performance.  It bodes well for my goal of sub-3 at London.

The course itself wasn't too bad, fairly flat and fast.  However, Southampton isn't really a scenic city, so there's not much in the way of highlights to look forward to along the route.

That said, it was great to be racing again - I'd forgotten how much the crowd and other runners can help you through the tougher parts.

One more tough week of training to go, then into the taper for my goal race!

**TL;DR**

First marathon attempt: DNF. Started running for the first time two years ago. Did a 16 week training plan for the marathon which peaked at 45 mpw. Longest training run was 17.2 miles. Didn’t consume enough water during the race, lots of stomach cramping, got dehydrated, had diarrhea at mile 16, run-walking by mile 18, threw in the towel at mile 20. 

**Background**

28M, 160 lbs (73kg). I’ve always been an athletic person, but never a runner. Played baseball in high school, skied in the winters, and played pick up basketball in college and beyond. Only time I ran was at the gym on a treadmill or occasionally outside as an attempt to “stay healthy”. Of course I would go out and run as fast as I could and get tired after a mile or two and resign to the fact that I wasn’t a runner. Somehow, I caught the running bug in 2019. First run on Strava was June 2nd, 2019 for 2 mi at 8:36/mi pace (!). I remember being so winded on this run that I barely made it the two miles. Despite not knowing what I was doing, I managed to build up some endurance to the point that I could run consistently without it being a total suffer fest. 

Continued running 2-3 times per week throughout 2019 and 2020. Did not know about heart rate zones and didn’t have a heart rate monitor. Did manage to build up mileage to the point where I was running 20-30 mpw through. Wasn’t following a specific plan. I thought if I gradually increased my mileage that was fine. Would make every run of the week 5 miles, then the next week 5.5 miles, for example. Of course looking back at my paces, I was running them all at tempo because I didn’t know about easy days. Of course I got hurt multiple times in 2020 (IT band first, knee second, hip third, etc) because I didn’t have any easy days and I probably wasn’t resting and eating enough. 

Despite all this naïveté, I did manage to run my first half marathon on September 12, 2020 in 1:55 (\~9 min/mi). Did not have a HR monitor at this time. Tried to keep running after this with the goal of completing a marathon, but kept getting hurt and very frustrated I couldn’t keep up the running volume. I rested most of the winter to try and get over this nagging hip injury and at some point started watching running videos on YouTube (Sage Cannaday, The Running Channel, Nick Bare) and realized I needed to incorporate more slow days and follow an actual training plan if I wanted to build up my mileage and not get hurt. 

**Training**

Decided on the beginner-intermediate training plan from higherrunning.com because I liked Sage Cannaday’s videos on YouTube. 16 week plan starting at 20 mpw building up to 45-50 mpw. Bought a heart rate monitor, which was game changing. Started fueling properly before and after runs (Skratch drink mix on runs longer than 60-90 minutes, ate more overall to meet caloric needs). Read advanced marathoning by Pete Pfitzinger. Did not get hurt once throughout the 16 week training plan (which I attribute to proper recovery between hard runs, proper fueling, actually having easy days). 

I haven’t done an official VO2 max test, but based on my age and training I guessed my max HR was somewhere between 186-190. Aimed for an average HR on easy days of 135-40 (9:30 min/mi), tempo 145-155 (8:30 min/mi), threshold 160-165 (7:45 min/mi). 

Peak week was 45 miles, which was about 4 weeks out from the goal marathon. The training plan I was following called for a 3 week taper, but when I started following the plan I miscounted the weeks, so had an extra week towards the end. Longest run prior to the marathon (33 days out) was 17.2 miles at an average 8:49 min/mi pace, average HR 147 bpm. 

**Pre-race**

Last long run was 10 miles, 7 days out from the race. My hip was bothering me towards the end, so I decided to not run the rest of the week and give it a chance to rest. Did 2 hour-long, zone 2 bike rides during the week instead. Loaded up on carbs the two days prior (\~500g carbs each day). Woke up at 4 am race day and ate a bowl of overnight oats (½ cup rolled oats, 1 cup almond milk, a scoop of greek yogurt, ½ banana) and had a cup of black coffee. Drank 500 mL of water with 1 scoop of Skratch mix in it at 5:30 am. Got to the race at 6:15 am, did some dynamic warm up, jogged for a few minutes and did some strides. 

**Race**

Thought it would be pretty good running weather (60-65 degrees, 97% humidity, cloud cover). Based on my long runs, I was hoping I could hold between 8:30-8:45 min/mi pace for 26.2 miles. This should have been my tempo zone, but perhaps I was overreaching. I don’t know if it was race day jitters or if I was starting out dehydrated, but the first two miles of the race I was running 9 min/mi pace and my HR almost immediately was up in the 145 range. On all of my training runs, I would run my easy days at this pace and it would take at least 2-3 miles before my HR was in the 130-140s. My goal was to try and keep my HR 145 ish for the first half of the marathon, then 145-155 ish for the second half. Felt okay for the first 10 miles. Paces were slower than I wanted, but I adjusted my sights to my secondary goal which was sub 4 hours. 

Aid stations were every 2.5 miles or so. I had a waist bottle with me that had 500 mL of water and a scoop of Skratch mix (20 g carb, 300 mg sodium) in it. I stopped at each aid station and had a few gulps of water, then finished my drink mix bottle by the halfway point. Picked up another bottle of the Skratch mix at the halfway point. For nutrition I had dried pineapple rings in my pocket (consumed 25 g of carbs worth in the first half). I tried Gu gels in training but on one of two of my long runs I had some GI upset, which I attributed to the gels. My 17 mile long run I had done with natural foods (dried pineapple rings and nectarines) and didn’t have an GI upset. I was aiming for 20 g carbs/hour (80g total over the marathon). 

Around mile 10 my stomach felt kind of crampy. Was adjusting my waist belt thinking maybe it was too tight. Didn’t feel like I was able to drink as much as I would have liked because of this discomfort. Came in at 13.1 mi at 1:58. Continued on at a consistent pace feeling okay fatigue wise. By mile 15 my stomach was really churning and I didn’t feel like I could drink more of my Skratch mix but did think water sounded good. By mile 16 there was an aid station and I felt like I really had to go number 2. Had massive diarrhea for a few minutes. Realized this was probably it for my goal of sub 4 hours. Shifted my sights to just finishing the race. Continued on at 9:30 min/mi pace for another mile or two, then felt so low on energy I had to start walking. Ran 10 min/mi pace for a few minutes, then walked. Kept this up from miles 18-20 before I started to get light headed and decided it was time to throw in the towel. Called my wife to come pick me up. I had filled up my bottle with 500 mL of straight water at the 20 mi aid station and managed to drink the whole thing, but still felt light headed just sitting there.

**Post-race**

Barely made it the 5 min car ride home without passing out. Immediately laid on the floor, was shivering, and felt like absolute trash. Laid there for 2 hours or so, took a little snooze. Wasn’t feeling like I could eat/drink anything. Took a few sips of water after 2 hours and it felt okay. Tried to get up and take a shower, but barely made it 2 minutes under the water before I felt so light headed I wanted to throw up. Caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I looked white as a ghost. Laid back down on the couch for a few hours and did nothing. Probably another 2 hours after that I felt like I could start sipping water. Ate a few crackers. Managed to keep that down and felt okay. Ate some more food and drank a total of probably 1000 mL. Stood up off the couch without passing out probably 4-5 hours after getting home from the race. Drank more water and had a big dinner. Felt much better by the end of the night.  

**Thoughts**

Absolutely embarrassed by my execution of this race. Never blew up this bad on my long runs leading up to the race. I think the primary problem was I overestimated my water intake at the aid stations and didn’t compensate for the fact that it was 97% humidity. Despite it being 62 degrees at the start of the race, I was still sweating quite a bit in the first half. It’s hard to estimate how much water I consumed, but 2-3 gulps at each station (6 along the course) probably added up to 250-500 mL, totaling 1000 mL of liquid in the first half. This is lower than what I would consume on my training long runs (would usually hit about 1500 mL for a similar distance, but this was always in hotter weather, so I assumed I wouldn’t need as much for this cooler race). The GI distress was the nail in the coffin because after that I really didn’t feel like I could consume an adequate amount of liquid. Unclear if this distress was from dehydration or from something else. I didn’t feel like my heart rate ever got out of control (average for the whole run was 149 bpm). Even towards the end when I was about to blow up, my HR was only 145-150, which should be at the lower end of my zone 3. Perhaps my inadvertent 4 week taper instead of 3 cost me some fitness.

I fell in love with running over the past year and really enjoyed this training block. I always looked forward to going out for a run and felt like I hit most of my training goals. Really disappointed but also humbled by this marathon attempt. As soon as I felt better last night, I was already looking forward to getting back out there and running again. I had signed up for two marathons this fall because I wasn’t sure if COVID would lead to cancellations. The next marathon is on November 14th (10 weeks from now). I was planning on following one of the modified, 8 week plans from Advanced Marathoning for this block since it’s shorter (giving myself 2 weeks of recovery). Mileage will peak at 50-60 mpw with the longest run being 19 miles. Happy to have a second shot at finishing a marathon this season. Going to set my primary goal at just finishing the marathon this time with a secondary goal being sub 4 hours.",1630844602
AdvancedRunning,FLP6,Sudden strong urge to pee during hard runs. Help!,"Hey everyone! Been lurking around this sub for a while now and it's my first time to post.

As what the title says, do you sometimes experience sudden strong urge to pee during hard runs?

I'm 31[M] and I've been running for 10 years now. But just recently, during my interval sessions, I get this sudden strong urge to pee whenever I go fast in between sets. And when I stop to take a pee, it stings a bit and the urge doesn't really go away after peeing. And I feel that there's some urine left but couldn't drain it all out. 

I have already consulted with a Urologist about this and did some blood works. Based on the result, the doctor couldn't find anything that correlates and causes this urinary issue during high intensity running.. But maybe except my elevated LDL cholesterol that could have possibly contribute to the problem. But he's not really so sure.

For reference.. I consider myself generally fit and above average runner. I'm 179cm tall and weighs 65kg for perspective. 

Anyone else have experienced this?? This really bothers me alot.

Hoping to learn from someone else's experience on how to fix this problem.

When does one incorporate the E/M/T/I/R workounts? It seems like following the White/Red/Blue/Gold plans is intended for base building, the race plans are intended for training for a specific race, but I can't figure out when the E/M/T/I/R come into play.

AdvancedRunning,comicallycomedic,Three Weeks Out from the Berlin Marathon- What's possible?,"Running my first marathon in Berlin on Sept. 26. Official PRs are 17:05 for 5km, 34:40 for 10km (big net downhill course) and 1:24 for the half. 

I'm following a modified Pfitz 12/55 plan, having added miles to most recovery and long runs. Topped out at about 70 miles over a seven day period and have been running roughly 55 miles per week over the last weeks. Did two weeks with long runs of 22 miles. 

Long story short, I have no idea what my potential for this race is, since I'm well beyond any level of fitness I've ever been in previously 

Some of the workouts I've done in the past six weeks or so:
-  19km marathon race pace effort at about 3:50 per km average. Faster than I aimed to go but felt really good and let it roll.
- 10km time trial: 34:50, with a 17:14 negative split on the 2nd 5km. Was shooting for sub 36 so I took it out pretty conservatively.
- 5 x 1km averaging 3:15 

I came into this training cycle with sub 3 as the baseline goal. I think, barring some big issue, that should be on hand. What's possible for me? Sub 2:50?",1630775388

AdvancedRunning,jstarke7311,Berlin (9/26) to Boston (10/11) Coaching Tips needed!,"TLDR: Tips for running back to back marathons in 2 weeks for injury prone runner on borrowed leg time. Finished an 18, do I taper now for Berlin to use it as training run for Boston. Tips? 

I’ll start out by saying I shouldn’t be running either of these races… I’m on a twice replaced ACL (but over 10 years and 2 marathons since then). I have been running most of my life, genes just aren’t built for it… however that may be I got a bib for Berlin last year, started training and it was cancelled, ended up getting a knee scoped and bone marrow injection last year instead, knee feels better than it did for years! I was training for about 16 weeks preparing for this years (2 setback weeks but long runs still completed at 11-13 min miles), when I received a dream opportunity to run Boston. So, as someone who is most likely not going to get a chance to see majors 5 and 6 (Chicago 2013, NYC 2018), I couldn’t pass on this. 

Anyway, had a dumb ankle injury 2 weeks back from pushing from my normal 10-12 min shorter run pace to 7-8 min. Took the rest of the week off with some pain, and then ran my 18 miler on 8/21. Couldn’t walk the next day without pain below ankle (feels like some Achilles tendinitis) After much ice, 2 weeks of rest missing my 14 miler taper long run, bike for 30 min daily last week, 3 accu/chiro sessions, I feel ready to get another long run in, if anything to build confidence mentally. I plan on continuing the accu/chiro 3x a week, torodol injection after this weekends run, and tapering dropping down to 1-2 runs a week until Berlin.

Berlin will serve to be my longest “training run” trying to save my legs as much as I can for Boston. Ice bathes and accu/chiro/light yoga daily with another massage in between.

Thoughts on the plan? Taper? How long my run should be this weekend after not running seriously for 2 weeks? Any tips would really help!",1630733228
AdvancedRunning,AdventureAwesome,Need Advice regarding maintenance miles,"I thrive on following a plan prior to a goal race but struggle with structuring the in between or maintenance miles before my next race build up.

AdvancedRunning,MotivicRunner,Tokyo Paralympic Marathon Preview,"The Tokyo 2020/1 Paralympics are quickly coming to a close, and this weekend is will be the marathons to cap things off for the athletics program. I haven't seen much discussion about para-athletics this past week, so I thought I would preview these marathons to hopefully generate some more interest in para-sport. The official Paralympics website also has a [couple](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/paralympics/sports/athletics/#para-discipline-description-athletics-marathon) [previews](https://www.paralympic.org/news/tokyo-paralympics-para-athletics-day-10-preview), as well.

**When:** Sunday, September 5 @ 6:30am Tokyo time (UTC+9) -- That's Saturday afternoon/evening for North Americans (5:30pm on the east coast, 2:30pm on the west coast) and Saturday night for people in Europe. Double check the [official schedule](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/paralympic-schedule-and-results-date=2021-09-05.htm) for the latest updates.

**Where to watch:** This will depend on your region, and whether or not you wish to use a VPN.

* **USA** \- TV broadcast on the [Olympic Channel](https://stream.nbcolympics.com/210904-olympic-channel-marathons), online streaming through [Peacock](https://stream.nbcolympics.com/para-track-field-s19-marathons) (full disclosure, I am very unfamiliar with the NBC broadcast schemes, so my links could be wrong).
* **Youtube** \- The [Paralympic Games Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/paralympics) should have a livestream. According to [Google](https://blog.google/products/search/paralympics-tokyo-games/), the stream will be available to 219 countries, so it should be accessible to most people outside the US. The stream will also be kept on the channel for later viewing in case you can't catch the races live. I've personally checked with a VPN connection to Canada and have been able to access the [livestreams and VODs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6CBAXPeBajmBZJ0XSQbsBU6y7K_D_i5M) that way.

**The course**

The athletes will be racing on the original Tokyo course that was also intended to be used for the Olympic marathons. It's almost as if the unilateral decision by the IOC to move the Olympic marathons and race walks 500 miles north to Sapporo was more about the optics of all the carnage from the 2019 world championships in Doha instead of actually looking out for the athletes.

The athletes will start and finish at the Olympic stadium, and pass by a number of iconic locations, including the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Tower, as they race through the streets of central Tokyo. The Tokyo Metropolitan government has a [good document with an overview of the course](https://www.2020games.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/course_English.pdf). The last \~5km are a steady climb back up to the Olympic stadium, so if any of the races are close that will likely be an important stretch to follow closely.

**Categories**

Because of the wide spectrum of impairments that can affect the athletes, they are separated into categories based on the type and severity of their impairments. World Para-Athletics maintains a webpage [describing all of the possible categories](https://www.paralympic.org/athletics/classification), while the Paralympic Games website has a [helpful general overview](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/paralympics/games/classification/) in case you want to learn more about how other sports handle classification. There are three main categories represented in this year's marathon.

* **T11/12** \- These athletes have vision impairments, with T11 athletes experiencing more severe impairment than T12 ones. Athletes in this category may have up to two guides, though athletes who choose to register two guides only runs with one at any given time in the race -- the guides will swap out part way. This adds an extra layer of teamwork and coordination for those athletes who do choose to use a guide.
* **T46** \- These athletes have upper limb impairments. Typical examples would be an above-elbow amputation in a single arm or below-elbow amputations in both arm. As a result, T46 athletes have to put extra effort into maintaining good balance while running, and also need to be creative with how they grab their drinks and nutrition.
* **T53/54** \- These athletes race in wheelchairs as a result of limb deficiency, leg length difference, impaired muscle power, or impaired passive range of movement. T53 athletes typically have more severe impairments from the waist down than T54 athletes. Because of the speeds they can reach (averaging 30km/hr, and maxing out around 50km/hr on downhills), races can often be strategically more similar to cycling races and running races with an emphasis on effective drafting to conserve energy.

**Athletes to watch**

With 66 athletes across all categories (men/women T11/12, men T46, men/women T53/54), it's a much smaller field than the Olympic marathons. Hopefully that makes it a little easier to follow all five of the simultaneous races as they happen. At the very least, since the wheelchair racers start a little earlier than the other athletes, they'll be well-separated from the rest of the field. For many of the athletes, these games are their first chance at high level international competition since the 2019 World Para-Athletics Marathon Championships in London, which were held as part of the London Marathon ([men's recap](https://www.paralympic.org/news/michael-roeger-unstoppable-london-marathon-debut), [women's recap](https://www.paralympic.org/news/manuela-schaer-makes-it-spectacular-six-london)).

* **Women's T11/12** \- With a 2:54:13 T12 world record set back in December's Hofu Yomiuri Marathon to better her 2:54:22 from February 2020, Japan's [Misato Michishita](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1727761-michishita-misato.htm) has the fastest PB in the field by over four minutes. She is looking to improve over her silver medal from Rio 2016 and win gold on home turf to add to her gold from London 2019. Michishita's closest competition is likely to be Brazil's [Edneusa de Jesus Santos Dorta](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1376430-de-jesus-santos-edneusa.htm), who finished behind Michishita for bronze and silver in Rio 2016 and London 2019, respectively. However, the de Jesus Santos also competed in the 1500m, taking 9th in the final, while Michishita will be coming into the marathon completely fresh.
* **Men's T11/T12** \- If this race had taken place last year, Morocco's [El Amin Chentouf](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1483958-chentouf-el-amin.htm) would be the heavy favorite with gold medals from Rio 2016 and London 2019, with the latter being a 2:21:23 T12 world record. This April, however, Australia's [Jaryd Clifford](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1415994-clifford-jaryd.htm) ""accidentally"" punched his ticket to Tokyo with a [2:19:08 debut marathon](https://runcreature.com/an-accidental-marathon-jaryd-clifford-sets-a-new-world-record-in-his-unbelievable-debut/) while pacing teammate and T46 athlete Michael Roeger. If Clifford has been able to adequately recover from his 1500m and 5000m races, where he earned a bronze and silver, respectively, could he win gold and bring back home a medal of each color from his ambitious triple? Also watch out for 2:22:28-man [Tadashi Horikoshi](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1727717-horikoshi-tadashi.htm) as he tries to win a medal for Japan after finishing just off the podium in Rio 2016.
* **Men's T46** \- Just going by PBs, this race is Australian [Michael Roeger's](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1416017-roeger-michael.htm) to lose. The former middle-distance runner (bronze in Rio 2016) burst onto the marathon scene with at 2:22:51 T46 world record in only his second crack at the distance in London 2019. Since then, he has only gotten faster and bettered his mark to 2:18:53, over six minutes faster than the next-fastest PB, with the pacing help of Jaryd Clifford, mentioned above, this April. That means it will be a tall task for China's [Chaoyan Li](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1589796-li-chaoyan.htm), the reigning Paralympic champion, to defend his title, especially with the current forecast of a [relatively cool (by Tokyo summer standards) and cloudy morning](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/japan/tokyo).
* **Women's T54** \- While she is the reigning Paralympic champion, China's [Lihong Zou](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1597967-zou-lihong.htm) has looked off of her Rio 2016 form so far in Tokyo. She got bounced out of the rounds in the 800m, and only placed 5th, 6th, and 9th in the 400m, 1500m, and 5000m, respectively. That may leave it up to her compatriot, young up-and-comer [Zhaoqian Zhou](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1597948-zhou-zhaoqian.htm) to step up and earn a medal for China. Zhou has already done well so far by winning golds in the 100m and 1500m, as well as a bronze in the 400m. A common theme among the athletes competing in the wheelchair races is competing in multiple events. If you thought Sifan Hassan's 1500-5000-10000 triple last month was impressive, then how about Switzerland's [Manuela Schaer's](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1717308-schaer-manuela.htm) 400-800-1500-5000-marathon quintuple? The reigning world champion is looking to add another medal to the two golds (400m, 800m) and two silvers (1500m, 5000m) she already has won at this Paralympics and improve upon her 6th place from Rio 2016. From an American perspective, no talk about wheelchair racing is complete without mentioning [Tatyana McFadden](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1572938-mcfadden-tatyana.htm). The six-time Olympian hasn't done quite as well as her Rio 2016 100-400-800-1500-5000-marathon sextuple, in which she earned four golds and two silvers, so far in Tokyo, but she is definitely a force to be reckoned with as she looks to upgrade her Rio 2016 marathon silver.
* **Men's T54** \- Reigning Paralympic champion, the Swiss Silver Bullet [Marcel Hug](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1521530-hug-marcel.htm), has had a golden games so far in Tokyo, with wins in the 800m, 1500m, and 5000m. Can he defend his title and make it a golden quadruple? He'll face a tough challenge from American [Daniel Romanchuk](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1662406-romanchuk-daniel.htm), who outsprinted Hug to the finish at the London 2019 world championships. At 23, Romanchuk is a quickly rising talent who became the youngest winner of the wheelchair race in the Boston Marathon in 2019 at the age of 20. Canada's [Brent Lakatos](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1521911-lakatos-brent.htm) will be another strong contender, having beaten Hug at the 2020 London Marathon. He's racked up silvers in the 100m, 400m, 800m, and 5000m thus far, so he's riding that line between being in great form and being a little overcooked with nine races in his arms between the heats and finals.

In the shoe shop the salesman told me that the Vaporfly isn’t really suitable for me and my pace (goal time: 3:15:00) and I should try totally different shoes. He gave me the Hoka one one and told me to race in these (better stability, better for “my style of running” etc).

AdvancedRunning,UltraRunningKid,Peroneal tendon pain only during max eversion,"Hello, 

Wondering if anyone has had something similar. 

I woke up the morning after a run and had some pain in my ankle, right under the bone on the outside that only hurts during max eversion (moving the toe outwards from the body. 

I knew instantly it was because I went onto a trail to make a shortcut with my Hoka road shoes and the combination of rocky upwards terrain, high stack height and the end of a long week of running made me a prime candidate for inflaming a tendon. 

Two weeks later it doesn't hurt while running at all (it never hurt while running), only hurts when I go to the very end of my eversion range of motion, and I did a 20 mile hike with 6,000ft of climbing and maybe only 4 steps on the turnaround of switchbacks actually hurt.

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,I'm in need of a new mindset. Really really struggling after a bad performance.,"I put this under health/nutrition because its kind of ""mental health"" related I guess.

Anyways, I got injured February 2021 and was thankful to be able to compete in track, where I actually improved my time in the mile (6:13 -&gt; 5:43) and ended up surprising myself and PRing every race. Over the summer, I was busy with work and camp and kept dealing with minor achilles injuries which was frustrating and unsettling. I decided that I would just be thankful to run mostly or completely pain free. And pre-season went really well! I felt very strong during all the workouts. My goal was not to be a top runner on the team, but to improve and enjoy racing. I've not really seen much improvement since early high school, despite putting in training, but have been patient and just been thankful to run mostly injury free.... 

Anyways, I had my first cross country 5k race a few days ago and it was like a nightmare. After warm ups I noticed my right quad had tensed and I was already dripping in sweat. But I still tried to tell myself I wouldn't PR but it would still be OK. I came through the first mile feeling fine but struggled on the second mile. It got really painful and I had to slow down, then finally I had to stop and walk. The whole last mile was hell. I was getting passed by everybody, and began to walk/jog. I got to the section where my parents were and literally went out of the course to talk to them for like 30 seconds about whether I should drop out or not. Meanwhile, my whole team saw me do this and I was like jogging down the finish line like an idiot, but they still enthusiastically cheered me on, including my crush. I wanted to die right there on the spot. My time.... 3 and a half minutes slower than my PR. I know some of that was from walking and talking to my parents during the race, but still. 

This whole day has been terrible as well as the past couple days. I've been in a horrible mood, trying to avoid everyone on the team out of embarrassment. I can't focus on anything. I was in so much pain during that - how the heck can I do better? I've barely ate all day, which I know is the wrong way to cope. My next race isn't for a while. I have zero confidence for that. What happens if I just get out there and blow it, too? I probably just overestimated my fitness again, like I do with everything.",1630629614
AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,How on earth do I bounce back from a horrible race? Could use some advice!,"I recently just had the worst race of my life. Despite feeling OK (actually pretty good) during runs, workouts, time trials leading up to it, I just blew it and finished more than 3 mins off my 5k PR, pretty much in dead last, too. I definitely went out fast but I thought I should've been able to hold it. I ended up walking/running the last mile or so, and stepped off the course for 15 seconds talking to my sister about whether I should drop out or finish (I know, embarrassing, right). Worse, it was the first race of the season and I haven't been able to focus on anything else. I don't know if I even want to race again. 

The next race is a while away and I KNOW I can do better, but I still lack confidence. For some more context, the pace was 10 sec slower than my half marathon race pace. I should've probably dropped out at the 2 mile mark when I began to walk, but I didn't. I am extremely frustrated about my performance and frustrated to be frustrated over this, as it's not like I was in it to win it or anything. I just thought I had trained better for it, that's all. I'm sure some day I'll look back on this race and laugh, but it's just making me sick.

AdvancedRunning,Albertos_Dog,"Apple Watch Discussion, and Question: What's the fastest marathon ever recorded on an Apple Watch?","I am constantly back-and-forth over whether I think the Apple Watch is a good running watch. 

On one hand, it basically can't take splits when you're sweaty, only allows the stock Workouts app to use the Always-on-Display (though soon to change), and has thoroughly mediocre (though improved!) battery life.

On the bright side - it finds GPS immensely fast (a huge benefit when you're freezing cold in your driveway), does have solid Stryd compatibility (a major consideration for me), and, with a cellular connection, and allows me to send messages while running (""are you already at the track?"" or ""I'm running five minutes late"").

There's my mini review (happy to field any specific questions for those on the fence). I ran my half-marathon PR in a Series 3, and it actually went over pretty well... though the race was basically out-and-back on Lakeshore Drive, so basically no room to mess up GPS tracking, no matter the device. I also ran the Austin Marathon in the same Watch, and found its performance to be mediocre - it totally bungled my HR, and was off of the mile splits after the first 5K (recording a total distance of 26.8, which isn't woefully terrible, but probably not correct, either).

I've tried more or less every iteration, and think the Series 6 is certainly a more than capable (if imperfect) device. I likely won't upgrade to Series 7, though I will admit I've said that, well, most years.

Anyway! Now my question, purely out of curiosity. Does anyone know who has run the fastest marathon in the Apple Watch? I actually saw some track athletes (sprint events) wear it during Tokyo 2020, but didn't notice any distance runners with one. I looked through some photos of the 2020 Trials, and while I am sure that at least someone was wearing one, I didn't find it. Just curious if anyone's ever blasted a sub-2:20 while filling their rings!",1630615001

AdvancedRunning,panifex_velox,"Watch recommendations, please!","Hello Advanced Runners,

It looks like my Garmin Forerunner 225 is giving up the ghost after seven years of service. I am in the market for a new GPS watch and would love some recommendations from those who keep up with this stuff.

Some relevant characteristics:

* I'm really just looking for something that can tell me how far I've run and how fast. I don't need music function or even optical HR in the wrist. 
* I've used Garmin stuff in the past but I'm not particularly brand loyal. 
* My old Forerunner had good basic functionality, but there were a few design flaws that bugged me over time. Notably, the cord would consistently fail after a few years (the plastic casing would wear out due to mechanical stress and then the wires would fray through), and getting the watch to connect with the cord cradle was sometimes made difficult because of poor design.
* I don't need any features I won't use, but I also don't want to wind up needing another new watch in two years. I don't mind paying for a quality product that will last.

Thanks for reading this, and for sharing your Hot Watch Tips!",1630597725

AdvancedRunning,jimi_hendrisk,help needed for my training plan!,"Hi!

I'm a guy, 36. I'm going back to running after a while without running seriously. My long-term goal is to get ready for ultras. I'm not a particularly good runner, but I really enjoy it and I want to get better.

These are my best times (all in 2018):

* Marathon: 3h 17mn (with 230m elevation)
* 10k: 41mn-ish
* 5k: 19mn 57s (YAY! :D)

I'm currently slowly ramping up my weekly mileage, with 4 runs a week:

* Monday: ""long run"" (not exactly a long run at this point while I'm still ramping up)
* Tuesday: ""long run"" (twice the distance as Monday, and same remark as above)
* Thursday: speed work (unstructured fartlek at this point)
* Saturday: hill work (\~300m elevation so far)

Note: I have a \~120m elevation slope that I have to climb for every single run. It's at the beginning of my run, it takes me \~15 minutes to reach the top of that hill.

I'm at roughly 40 km/week right now. I'm currently increasing mileage by 5\~7% per week, and every third week I'll decrease by 2\~3%. I'll add a weekly 5th, and maybe a 6th run, once my mileage justifies it. I'm in no rush.

I also cycle a fair bit, it's my main means of transportation.

I have a Garmin watch and I always run with a HR monitor. My max HR is \~180 and try to stay below 135\~140 for my long/slow runs.

&amp;#x200B;

How good/bad is this training? Am I doing too much effort, with speed AND hill work every week, especially considering the hill I need to climb at every run?

Thank you!",1630585088

AdvancedRunning,foofoobee,Accelerated training program to get back into race shape in 4-5 weeks?,"Hi all, long story short - I'll now be running a half-marathon race in mid October that I hadn't been training for. My last HM race was back in April and I've just been doing general training since then - following no real structured plan since I hadn't planned on any other races this year. It's mostly been an easy pace long run on Saturdays (anywhere from 15-23 km), an easy 10k recovery run start of the week, a 7-10k tempo run once a week, and then just easy/mid-pace 10ks on 1-2 other days.

The issue is that this routine has been heavily disrupted over the summer with travel and then tendonitis for about 3 weeks in my left foot. So I've lost a good deal of fitness and am just working my way back. My ""long runs"" have been only 12-13 kms lately.

I'm not worried about completing the half-marathon, but I'd like to try to at least be in the neighborhood of my last one where I completed in about 1:49. While I know that's not an amazing time or anything, it's still something I'd really like to shoot for again. Right now I'm sure I'd be way off that mark.

I wanted to know if there's any kind of condensed training plan for someone in my situation to get back into race shape over the next 4-5 weeks, without hurting myself.

For background: I'm 41/M - I typically run 4-5 days a week for a total of 55-60 km. This figure has been impacted greatly by injuries in the last month or so but I am starting to ramp back up again.",1630533494

Used by the Northern Arizona Elite team, this workout is intended to keep the speed in the legs and maintain proper form during a marathon cycle.

*What:*

3-4x(200-200-400)

*How:*

Pretty simple. 3 or 4 sets of 200m + 200m + 400m with equal recovery jogs. Run the reps at mile pace. With 2.4-3.2k worth of speed this workout isn't too taxing on top of the heavy mileage of a marathon cycle, but it should let your muscles remember what going fast feels like.

Never had an issue before the inserts, and looking for advice","Went to see a Physio about 2 weeks ago regarding chronic shin splints, and he suggested that I try a medium-range generic shoe insert, as he believed that the pronation of my feet were causing the stress on my shins, and the inserts would distribute the load more vertically down my shin.  We scheduled a followup but I'm having issues now and my appointment is still a few weeks out and I'm not sure what to do.

I started by just running the last mile of my runs with the insert in, except for my long run.  After a week I didn't feel any issues so I ran some short runs with the insert in, no issues whatsoever.  This past Sunday I decided to run my easy 4 mile run with the inserts in.  Felt fine during the run.  Afterwards, however, my right foot hurt a decent bit along my first metatarsal.  I could feel it when walking around the rest of the day, and a tiny bit the next day.  I chalked it up to one of those come-and-go injuries that happen all the time and are gone the very next run.

Monday was a day off, and today I ran 5 with the insole in, and towards the end of the run my foot was hurting in the same spot.  After the run this morning my foot has been aching all day, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Im leaning towards taking time off until maybe Saturday, but regardless of time off, should I call it quits on the inserts?  I've never had an issue with my feet in my life, and I'm at least slightly skeptical the inserts are good for me because I have an extremely high arch (I've always heard inserts were more for flat footed people).

Any advice?  Should I take time off?  Should I keep with my training but ditch the inserts?  I don't want to go to my physio appointment in a few weeks with a totally new injury, and this has got me pretty down in the dumps to be honest. 🙁",1630453091

AdvancedRunning,Sloths4sloths,Boston bound or bust?,"I qualified for Boston at Chicago 2018. I ran a 3:14:55 on consistent but low mileage training. I ran about 35-40miles/week and completed 13,15,20, and 18 mile long runs in the 8 weeks leading up to that marathon. 

I've been training for Boston since December 2019. During 2020 I had a great build up of 45 mile weeks until the pandemic hit and I cruised at 30-35miles/week for the rest of the year with minimal breaks. This year I ramped up my training. From January to May 2021 I was hitting 50miles/week and running one workout per week. These were some of my best tempos and fastest splits in workouts since college (I ran D1 back in the 2000s and i'm in my 30s now). In May I strained my groin and since then my body has fallen apart. I developed a deep pain in my right hip and achilles tendonitis on my left leg. I was running through the pain, but my achilles on my last 13 mile long run was pretty painful, like a 6-7/10. Almost two weeks ago I was doing a recovery run and my right calf seized up. It was immediate and I couldn't put any weight on my toes. So yea, I have three injuries.

**Training**

 In October 2019, my friend asked me to do a half marathon scheduled for November 2019. So I started running again after a long hiatus due to injury. I didn't end up doing the race. 

However,  I ended up running a 10k in January 2020 and finished around 47:44. 

I  continued training following different training plans like the dynamic training plans on MapMyRuns for the half marathon and Garmins Heart Rate beginner plan for HM. This usually got me somewhere between 15mpw to 35mpw doing base building, tempo runs, intervals, etc. Looking back on it now, I felt like my training was all over the place and I was not really improving. 

Then in March 2020, my quad started acting up after running downhill. I took a month off and just crossed-trained and focused on cross training such as cycling and elliptical.  However, the gym membership was a bit too pricey so I stopped doing that after the free trial. 

It wasn't until April 2021 where I dedicated myself to base building.  I pulled up a base building plan from high school that takes me from 15mpw to 60mpw in 13 weeks. This looks like the following (15, 20, 25, 15, 25, 20, 30, 25, 40, 35, 50, 40 and 60) 15mpw and 20mpw had two rest days and 25+mpw was only one rest day.  Almost all my running was at an easy pace in Zone 1 or Zone 2 of my Heart Rate Reserve. I stuck to this for about 10 weeks.  Pace wise this translates to about 9-11 minute miles depending on how hot it is outside. 

During the middle of week 10, I went on vacation and ended week 10 at 25mpw instead of 50 mpw. I found it difficult to get back on track. I feel like mentally I just wasn't there, my mind was still on vacation. I decided to take another easy week at 25mpw. 

At this point, Pfitz 60 mile base building plan, 38 mpw to 60 mpw over 10 weeks didn't seem so intimidating. So far I have been following the plan sticking to general aerobic and endurance % of HRR guidelines. Pace wise, I am running a little faster now depending on the heat ranging from 8-11min/mile pace. I do try and treat the endurance workouts as progressions and end the last quarter or third of the workout at a higher % of HRR. 

However, nearing the end of week one, I got an itch to race and test my summer fitness. I ran a 5k time trial about on 28 July 2021 in 22:00mins but doing a solo TT just isn't the same as a race. So I found Sunrise Stampede which would take place towards the end of week 2. I had a 7 mile General Aerobic workout scheduled that day and figured I could race and just do a cooldown to hit my mileage for the day. I figure if I am going to race I might as well do it early in the building phase. 

I used the 5k TT as a reference pace for this 10k using Jack Daniel's VDOT calculator which had me at 7:21min/mile for a 10k. 

Other than that I didn't do any race specific workouts leading up to this 10k. This is my second 10k ever so it's not really something I am familiar with and would love to hear recommendations for the future. 

**Pre-race**

I woke up drank two (2) cups of water and ate a banana. I arrived to the race location about twenty (20) minutes before the start time. Check in was fast. I did a quick seven (7) minute warm up I follow along like I would for my usual runs. Then I jogged over to the start line with about 5 mins to spare, did about five (5), one hundred (100) meter strides. Then the starting time was delayed about ten (10) minutes. So I tried my best to easy my nerves waited a few minutes before doing some more strides. I tell myself to stick to my reference pace of 7:21min/mile and if I feel good run faster. 

**Race**

The gun goes off, I feel fantastic. 

**Mile 1**) 

The race starts off with a one mile loop before turning into an Out and Back. I go around the crowd tightly grouped together in front of me. I am about half a mile in when I look at my watch and notice I am on pace for a 6:20 first mile. Instantly, I thought to myself, no way I feel that good. So I try my best to adjust and reign myself in. I somewhat manage to do that and drop my pace down to end the first mile at 6:48. I do feel like I am breathing pretty hard. My legs feel light and my shoulders feel relaxed. So I start thinking I can maintain around here. A the end of the loop I can see, the leaders are way up front, no way I am catching them. At this point, I am somewhere in the top 20 and feeling comfortable. 

**Mile 2**) 

I keep telling myself I should be aiming closer to 7min/mile. So I try to readjust my pace again but am struggling to get a feel for it. Maybe I've been too reliant on my Heart Rate Training. The pack I am running with is starting to slow down. Thankfully I readjusted my pace and didn't implode. 

**Mile 3**)

I feel good, I feel light, I feel like I can start catching up to people in front of me.  This is when the pack starts thinning out. The pack I was running with starts slowing down below 7min/mile pace. So it's time for to start catching up to people in front of me. I dropped down to about 6:51 pace.

**Mile 4**)

On the fourth mile I regret my decision to catch people so soon. I could have gone a more relaxed pace. I think t the gap between me and the next person was too big at this point in the race and when I ran out of people to catch up to and I lost a bit of motivation here. I just tried to maintain my pace after I ran out of people to catch up too. I lost sight of the people in front of me. 

**Mile 5**)

During this portion of the race, I feel like I  gained some ground on the people in front of me, I can see them again. I am motivated again but I start feeling heavy at this point. I keep telling myself to ""Run tall, run strong, breathe easy"" one of my personal mantra's. 

**Mile 6**)

I am within striking distance of passing someone again but it doesn't come as easy as it did earlier in the race. I pass the person in front of me on a slight uphill, with about what I think is a mile in race left.. 

**Last 0.2**)

Then on the final stretch the last person I passed catches up to me and then proceeds to surge past me. I am barely holding it together as I cross the line and finish at what feels like a jog. 

**Post-race**

I congratulate the guy I ran the last mile with. If he wasn't there I am pretty sure my last mile would have been slower.  I grab some of the sliced oranges and bottled water. Then I go do a ten (10) min cool down jog and stretch. Check out my splits and wish I didn't go out so fast and I kept a more consistent pace through out the race. Then think about again and I am just happy. Last time I did an actual 10k race it was 47:44 back in Jan 2020 so it's been over a year since my last race. So overall, I am satisfied with this result and hope I can stay consistent and healthy.

I am going to continue to base build. I have a half marathon scheduled on Nov 7th. which will be my second HM. Although, my first one was around 10 years ago so it probably isn't the best reference. So I plan on looking at Pfitz for key workouts a few weeks before the race and doing an actual taper. From there I plan on picking a Pfitz marathon training plan. I am eyeing the OC Marathon in May 2022 which will be my first marathon so I am excited.

### Training

I spent most of this past year base building. I am currently base building up to 60 miles using Pfitz. I am on week two (2) and wanted to use this race as a fitness check. So I wasn't doing any race specific training. However, I did a 5k time trial about a month ago in 22:00mins. So I used that as a reference pace for this 10k. 

### Pre-race

I woke up drank two (2) cups of water and ate a banana. I arrived to the race location about twenty (20) minutes before the start time. Check in was fast. I did a quick seven (7) minute warm up I follow along to from the Running Channel. Then I jogged over to the start line with about 5 mins to spare, did about five (5), one hundred (100) meter strides. Then the starting time was delayed about ten (10) minutes. So I tried my best to easy my nerves waited a few minutes before doing some more strides. 

### Race

The gun goes off, I feel fantastic. I go around the crowd tightly grouped together in front of me. I am about half a mile in when I look at my watch and notice I am on pace for a 6:20 first mile. So I try my best to adjust and reign myself in. During the second mile, I tell myself I should be aiming closer to 7min/mile. Then on my third mile, I feel good, I feel light, I feel like I can start catching up to people in front of me. On the fourth mile I regret my decision. On the fifth mile, I am motivated again, I am within striking distance of passing someone again and I do. I feel terrible. Then on the last 0.2, I am barely holding it together as I cross the line. 

### Post-race

Congratulate the guy I ran the last mile with. I grab some of the sliced oranges and bottled water. Then I go do a ten (10) min cool down jog and stretch. Check out my splits and wish I didn't go out so fast and I kept a more consistent pace through out the race. Then think about again and I am just happy. Last time I did a 10k it was 47:44 back in Jan 2020 so it's been over a year since my last race. So overall, I am satisfied with this result and hope I can stay consistent and healthy.

AdvancedRunning,HavingAPfitz,"Don't Go Out Too Fast She Said, You'll Blow Up, She Said: Twilight 5000m","### Race Information
* **Name:** Twilight 5000m
* **Distance:** 5000m
* **Time:** 0:19:26

* Age: 28
* Sex: F
* Current MPW + pace: 55mpw 4wk/avg || ~8:00-8:30 GA, 7:10-7:30 LR, 5:25-6:00 VO2 max, 6:30-40 LT
* Peak MPW: 61

Started running again in February after about six months of zero mileage. Got up
to 30mpw average by the end of May, ran 35-45 with average 37/wk June through
end of July, then kicked it up a notch and managed an average of 55mpw in August
to date.

I've been badgering all of you for feedback on 5K training for weeks, so it's
only proper I finally race one. My fitness is about where I expected it to be,
my race performance was not.

I made a race plan, completely ignored it, and blew up. Gory details below.


### Goals

|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Sub-19 | *No* |
| B | PR | *No* |
| C | Race Smart | *No* |
| D | Finish | *Yes* |

### Splits

??? - I didn't touch my lap button during the race, but they were giving us
elapsed time at the quarter mile / start line. I remember coming
through 400m in 81 and one mile in 5:51.

### Training

I have been v. loosely following Pfitz's 45-55mi 5K plan with extra mileage and
workouts run by my local running store. I generally take Monday as a rest day
for mobility and PT work and run every other day.

Last four weeks' speed workouts:

1. 12x400, 75s rest: 81-85 (1 @ 75)
2. 6x1mi, 2:30 rest: 6:24, 6:03, 6:09, 6:12, 6:14, 6:20
3. 2 Sets 6x400, 60s rest between intervals + 400m jog between sets: 85-89
4. 8 x 2' 10k pace, 1' MP

Sunday Long Runs have been 15 to 18mi averaging 7:30-7:40. Outside of a
4mi mid-run tempo splitting 7:06/6:58/6:52/6:44, these have mostly been steady state
or mild progression runs.

The rest of week is filled with GA (T/Fr/Sa) and recovery runs.

### Pre-race

Ran Wednesday's workout -- the 12x400 above -- too hard but otherwise had a
relaxed week and felt confident and well-rested going into the race.

Got to the track to watch and cheer on the earlier heats. With a half hour
to go, got in a 2.5mi warm up jog and a couple of race pace 200s and 100m strides
to loosen up.

Some unforeseen rain aside, we had the best August weather for a race a New
Englander can ask for, with temps in the high 60s.

### Race

I have, and seemingly always have been, a workout hero. I have a great block of
training, go into a race thinking I'm set to PR, then go out too fast, blow up,
and limp it across the finish line. I think if I were smarter I would long ago
have looked at my performances through the years, seen the events I excel at,
and decided to gut it out at longer events where you have a better chance of
recovering from pacing mistakes early on, but no, I stick by 5K like a scorned lover.

This race continued that streak.

My heat had an 18:30 and 19:00 pacer; I lined up at the farthest end of the
start knowing I would be on the slower end of the heat. Race official informs us
it's a 440yd track, but they'll be shouting out the elapsed time at each 1/4
mile to help us pace. Checked my laces one last time. We start, I settle in a
couple spots behind the 19' pacer.

We get through 200 in 40-something, and come through the quarter in 81. Pacer
keeps going. Remind myself my race plan was to come through 400 no faster than
93 and do everything in my power to negative split. Ignore my better judgment
and convince myself it'll be fine, there's plenty of time to slow down and
recover a bit during the race.

1600m down in 5:51. Try to convince myself it'll be ok. Know in my lungs, if not
my head, that it will not be.

Lose contact with the field somewhere around lap 5. Lap 7-10 are a haze of ""do
not get lapped"" and ""if you DNF you're not even going to be able to sanity check
your workout paces"". Drag it across the line DFL in 19:25.x.

### Post-race

Check in with friends and ask my brother if knew my final 400/200m splits.
Congratulate friend on her win, and head home to pore over data in Golden
Cheetah, as if there's anything more to it than ""Don't go out too fast, dummy"".

## Conclusion

Even having blown up as badly as I did, it's still my 2nd best 5000m time and
run just days after my highest mileage week of all time. I'm confident that with
better pacing and smarter training over the next month I can still squeeze out a
PR at the second race in the series.

Advice for sharpening workouts or adjustment to training encouraged. My takeaways
were to stress longer intervals or race predictor workouts like 4x1mi w.
60s rest and 5x1200 to get better accustomed to the late race fatigue and
improve my ability to quickly lock on to race pace.

AdvancedRunning,bigtechdroid,Serious: Can you get fitter while not running?,I haven't ran in 4 weeks due to a problem I'm having. I've dropped 15 lbs and on track to be 25lbs down when I return to running after 6 weeks off. I will be 10% bf the leanest I've ever been. Do you think the weight loss will counteract the loss in fitness for 6 weeks? I've been trying to swim/bike to maintain cardio but I'm only managing once a week.,1630334287
AdvancedRunning,RunningAwaySlowly,Sunglasses?,"What are the best sunglasses for longer runs? I almost always run with a hat, but when you're running towards the sunrise for a long time it gets a little old. I have a few pairs of cheap polarized sunglasses from Amazon that do the job, but loads of sweat muddies up the lenses to the point where it's better to just take them off. Is there a pair of sunglasses out there that really prevents sweat from dripping or collecting on the lenses? Just wanted to see what has worked for everyone else.",1630330351
AdvancedRunning,Georgios_A,"""Unbreakable"" 24 hour ultra running record broken after 24 years","NEW 24 HOUR WORLD RECORD


Aleksandr Sorokin of Lithuania broke Yiannis Kouros’ “untouchable” 24 Hour record this weekend at the UltraPark Weekend event in Poland. Sorokin ran 309.400 km (192.25 miles) with a pace of 4:39/km (7:29/mile)

Kouros, the Greek running legend ran 303.506 kilometers (188.590 miles) in 1997 on track (and 290.221 kilometers (180.335 miles) on the road in 1998) and his records have long been considered almost unbreakable - Killian Jornet notably failed to break Kouros' 24hr track record last November 

Sorokin has been on form this year, setting new 150-kilometer, 12-hour, and 100-mile world records in April, in the Centurion 100 mile track event in Kent, England (which is where I reside and how I first heard of this amazing athlete, who definitely deserves more recognition)",1630329610
AdvancedRunning,JamesFattyHarden,How Quick to Return to 60+ mpw,"Hello all, 

I had a very unfortunate last ~4 months where a non-running injury kept me out for 4 weeks and then some family drama and marital porblems kept me from really returning to my previous mileage for the summer. 

Background context: I ran an average of 240 miles per month from Oct 2020 to March 2021 peaking at 72mpw, and averaging about 65mpw from Jan-March. 

Current situation: I have run about 500 miles in May 2021 - August 2021 with only 170 of those miles coming in July and August. I've only averaged 20mpw over the last 12 weeks and 27mpw over the last 18 weeks. I ran 35 miles over 4 days last week and felt pretty good. 

How soon do you think is safe for me to ramp back up to 60+ mpw? I have tentatively planned to increase my mileage like this starting this week.

AdvancedRunning,CMDR_Machinefeera,Quick question about my first Marathon taper.,"Hello AdvancedRunning

In September i have my first marathon and I am now in the middle of tapering for it. But I have a few questions regarding the taper.

My peak week had 100km with 38km long run, then i started my taper with 90k week 25k long run, this week i will have 80km and on the race week 70.... but I never see this mentioned somewhere and i was wondering... does those 70km in last week of the taper include the Marathon ? I think it does but I wanted to make sure.

Also does this seem good enough taper ?

Thanks for any help",1630328575
AdvancedRunning,Fourth_Train,Is it possible for me to go from 18:39 to low 17s in one season,"I'm a high school junior (16M). In my first race I just ran 18:39, it was very hot (91°F), and kind of hilly. The 3 weeks leading up to this were my highest mileage weeks and they were 50.9, 52.7, and 55.1. The week of the race I took a break and only did 15 miles. I'm not doing any more aerobic base weeks now that we've started the season. 

My team is not super serious about xc, it's more like the people who want to work hard will have to find time to put in extra work. Our coach has us do ""long runs"" that are like 6-7 miles. Obviously I've done waayyyy more than that, our average weekly mileage for varsity runners is probably like 20-30 miles.

Does anyone have tips on how I can make my training as effective as possible during racing season. And tips for how to really drop my time so I can help my team out at state.

If other prs would be useful, my track times last year were 800m - 2:19, 1600m - 5:01, 3200 - 11:17.",1630304945
AdvancedRunning,ROGER_SHREDERER,Why are over-unders never really used in a running training plan? (Or are they?),"Over-unders are often used in cycling training. The definition of them is:

&gt;Over under intervals are structured tempo, sweet spot or threshold intervals** with an anaerobic effort &gt; 120% of FTP (Functional Threshold Power) for 20-180 seconds, at the beginning and end of each interval. After the ""overs"" the athlete returns to the under wattage until the next ""over.""

Now, I do realize that running and cycling differ in that running doesn't have as much surging compared to cycling. However, the main benefit is that over-unders teached your body to process lactate much efficiently, which I would imagine running can benefit from. 

Is there any reason why running doesn't use these workouts more often?",1630293342
AdvancedRunning,fifamahemking,How do I effectively reflect on what worked in a build to help plan my next plan?,"Not necessarily looking for an exact answer but even just some good material to help me understand what may have worked and what may not have worked as well in the block.

Back story is I just started running again in March. Did a 18 week build into a half mara and ran 1:37:20 PB

Through my block I hit a 5km PB of 20:45 as a TT, and ran a 44:40 in the race for my 10k PB.

I want to start doing my own programs to give me more purpose in running and I enjoy understanding it.

The half I did was with a coach but the workouts seemed to lack purpose and didn't pair up well with preparing me for future ones to my time goal. It was a good fun interesting program though for my first half in a year. I got through uninjured at about 44km per week and have now lifted to 50km since and felt good.

However, in building my new plan I'm not sure what to look at in order to know what was effective in preparing me for the race and what I can change going forward to trial new ideas from other coaches or what type of athlete I am and what may suit me. I was thinking of doing a plan with each of the main coaches who have written books to help me build my plan eg Hudson, Hanson, Pfitzinger, Daniels, kenovo maybe ect. 

Appreciate all advice and answers!",1630288907
AdvancedRunning,NeuroBossKing,Whats the best way to train between two marathon if you want to PR on the second one?,"Let’s say at peak before a marathon, I’m running 50 miles a week.

AdvancedRunning,conormcgloin,Fast Trail Shoes - Recommendations?,"After a pretty lousy summer here in the UK, I'm beginning to look forward to trail running through the winter. I'm a pretty experienced runner, though only through triathlon (17:17 5k, 1:23 half), and have been running trails in the same old pair of Saucony shoes for about five years. They were a very cheap buy at the time, as I didn't know if I'd stick with the trails.

My problem is that they're really, really heavy. I understand that trail shoes are never going to rival my racing flats, but these guys are definitely on the weightier side. It feels like I'm dragging two lumps of rock about on my feet!

Do you have any recommendations for lightweight trail shoes that still have fantastic grip? I wear Nike and Adidas road shoes, but have happily worn Saucony in the past. Are there any that let you skip up muddy hills at a decent pace? Are there any non-spike (my trails have rocks, tarmac and mud throughout) cross country shoes you'd recommend? If it makes any difference, I have very, very narrow size 9 (UK size) feet.

I have a pair of Hoka Rocket X with about 90-100 miles on them but I typically only where those about once a week as they are my triathlon race shoes.

I’ve done the former but am curious about what the latter would look like. For instance, if there are races every Sunday, how should I plan to recover/maintain/improve fitness during the week?

Background: 
14m, 9th grade
8th grade prs: 2:20 800, 5:24 mile, 12:06 2 mile. Important note: I didn’t run the 2 mile in track season, so that pr’s around a year old. First race of the season was a week ago, I ran a 12:09 (huge disappointment).
Training:
I run in high school xc, new freshman this year. I’ve been doing about 25-30 mpw with a good amount of speed work and a long run all summer. Long run of 7-8 miles once a week, and strides and form work pretty much every day. Not looking for training advice in this thread, I’m gonna stick to my coach.

Pre-race:

About 40 minutes out we had a 10 minute warmup jog, then a dynamic warmup. 15 minutes out, put on spikes and jog to starting line. 10 minutes out, do some grass strides to work on the start.

Race:

The race started and I was forced to get out hard due to being at a bad position for the first bottleneck. Settled in after around 400m, and held a steady pace for a while. I came through the mile in 5:43. However, I was already quite tired at this point. For the next 1200 meters I was dying, losing ground, and fighting to stay in the race. Note: The leader won by almost minute in 10:28, this was not a close race. Coming into the homestretch I could barely breath, legs were jelly, and I was fighting for every step. 2 people passed me in the last 200 for 12th overall. Top 10 medaled :(. 
Post-race (And Questions):

So obviously I had horrible pacing during this race, so that left me with a couple of questions. (sorry for bad formatting) 
1)How much of an impact could an even split have on my final time? 
2) I’m not a guy with good sprint speed, would it be a good strategy to kick into final gear with like 600 left to try to form a gap before the final stretch? 
3) Knowing my past running, what’s a reasonable goal for the end of the season? (7 weeks out)",1630187512

AdvancedRunning,Clowns_Sniffing_Glue,What milestones should I have on the road to a trail ultra with +3000m elevation?,"Hello!

I want to sign up and just finish a trail 50k/31miles next May (or be overly ambitious with a 100k/60miles in June). The shorter distance has +3000m/9800 feet of evelation and a cutoff time of 12 hours. What milestones should I set along the way to see if I'm going to be prepared? How much vert is appropriate per week? 

The thing is that I'm currently a slow pavement pounder, who doesn't really have enough throttle on trails. Right now I run 70-90k per week at a comfortable (when not tired) pace of 5:37 per k. I'm training for a flat marathon in a month, hopefully with an avarage pace of 5:35 per k. /9min per mile. 

Secondly, I live in a very flat area, where all the runners share 2-3 tiny hills or one set of stairs, in order to do some amount of vert. There are dunes with sand also, yay. That is why I need to know how much hill repeats I should do, it's not like zoning out on a long run. 

Is there an estimation about how much distance and vert I should be accumulating, per week, 5 months or 2 months out from the race? 

Will just running all winter on sand, in the rain, be enough to toughen me up for a spring mountain?

AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Crash Training With Frank Horwill,"For those unfamiliar with the late, great Frank Horwill - he was one of Birtain's premiere middle distance coaches in the 60s-90s as the founder of the British Milers Club, and receiving credit for formulating the 5-pace theory. You can find a lot of his work around the internet, but Serpentine Running Club keeps a great collection of [short articles by him](https://www.serpentine.org.uk/pages/advice_frank.html) in an archive.

His work is, for lack of a better word, ""polarizing"" in the sport. It seems that everyone who I have spoken to about him either thinks he's a lunatic, or says that he's brilliant. The reason for this divide is usually because his training philosophy is unreasonably difficult and often looks like an injury waiting to happen. I recommend going through his articles and making an opinion for yourself though. While some may feel little dated now (they *were* written decades ago after all), his writing style is engaging and there's certainly a lot of interesting stuff in there, even if you might not agree with all of it.

One article that I want to ask about specifically is [Double or Quits](https://www.serpentine.org.uk/pages/advice_frank19.html). This article certainly contributes to Horwill's air of lunacy (and was actually the article that made me a big fan of his back when I was in college). Here he posits the idea of ""Crash Training"", described as ""the doubling or even trebling of the training load in quantity **and** quality for a period of not less than two days and not more than seven days, followed by an **equal number** of recovery days."" 

Ultimately, the idea is to induce ""super-compensation"" by very seriously challenging your body and then very seriously resting your body. So what we usually do on a micro scale (workout day, easy day), taken to the extreme. While 7 days straight of super high mileage and/or workouts sounds suicidal, perhaps there is a training benefit to smaller chunks? Other coaches have adopted similar approaches in their training. For all of the Pfitz folks in the group - correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that he has a 10k tune up with a LR back to back. Canova's ""special blocks"" are a similar concept - albeit with the workouts in the same day. Anecdotally, I personally live and die by this method in my training (not that my PRs are worth writing home about...), and have seen great success with frequent use of crash sessions. For reference, mine usually top out at 3-4 days and are done less frequently than Horwill prescribes though..

I will note by the way, that Horwill is not the creator of crash training (he credits Snell actually), but his name seems to frequently come up in discussions of the concept likely because of this article and his reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

So with the background out of the way, some discussion for you all:

\- Have you tried something similar? Do you think that the results were more, or less successful than a more traditional training approach?

\- Is there a physiological argument for Crash Training? What specific benefits does this provide that a workout day - easy day approach would not? Would it elicit any unique training responses that you couldn't get otherwise?

\- Assuming that we can get a benefit - where's the line? Can athletes really expect to double their training volume for 7 days and not get injured? What would be the cut off for ""maximum kill yourself days"" in a row?

\- What's the appropriate way to crash yourself? Frank tells us that it's a bump in intensity, but leaves the door open on the specifics. Should the daily goals simply be climbing to higher mileage? Should it be more explosive work? Do we alternate the types of workouts, or would we receive better super-compensation by stacking similar workouts (i.e. tempos or hills each day vs some combination of the two)?",1630165259
AdvancedRunning,ThePeeGod,What to do in a race: Push and Sustain or Sustain and Push?,"Cheers all,

I need an advice for a half marathon I'm attending in 2 weeks. I've only participated to a few races before just to finish, and I'm quite far away from the 'racing mentality'. I train for long distances, so my training is based on low-to-middle effort rather than high effort. I've added a little bit of interval runs to my training for the last couple of weeks and I see to potential in me to push things a little bit hard. My very comfortable pace is 1h50m and I do have the goal of finishing below 1h40m. Yet, I cannot help but wonder if I can manage to pull of 1h30m. I'm aware that there is a huge difference between 1h30m and 1h40m, but I feel like the race mentality is always different. There are also pacers in the race that I could follow, but I couldn't decide what my plans should be. What do you suggest, should I follow 1h30m pacers and see if I can sustain it until the end OR follow 1h40m pacers and push a lot harder towards the end.

However I've never tried anything else or talked to other runners so I don't know what's generally considered good/best and Google is filled with so much conflicting information and marketing BS that I don't know what to believe.

I'm in the process of focusing my efforts on a HM coming up in about 4 weeks - does losing a little of this training volume significantly affect anything?

For the other things I've cut out I had planned a 4×4min interval but I only finished 3, and earlier this week I had a 3×12min threshold but was a little slower on the 2nd and 3rd reps. I know the losses will be minimal, but I'm curious to see what y'all have to say.",1630098374

AdvancedRunning,vortex-street,Comparison of marathon programs,"Has anyone here tried a number of the different marathon training programs/philosophies over the years? For example, Pfitz, Hanson's, Daniels, even others like Magness, Canova, etc... I'm currently mid Pfitz 12/70 which has been going well but I've been curious about trying different methods training in the future. I feel like sticking with any of these plans/methods would get you ""good"" results, but for those who have tried several, did you find one that stood out as working the best for you?

It seems to me like one of the main differences is when to hit the speed (faster than threshold) workouts the most. Pfitz seems to add those towards the end of a plan where Hanson's or Canova seem to advocate more general speed work earlier in the plan, working towards more race-pace specific workouts later on. I can see a case for either, but can also imagine they'd lead to two different outcomes from the same athlete.

I gave Magness's book a read years ago when I was 5k training and found it very interesting. Seemed to advocate some less ""basic"" workouts to try and trigger specific stimuli, ex. blend intervals, doing runs at more than ""just"" easy/threshold/interval paces, etc. Has anyone applied his methods to marathon training?",1630062752
AdvancedRunning,tommsyeah,What next? Setting goals,"Hi all! 23M here


BACKGROUND:

Been running on and off for 3 years. 5 days ago I ran my first HM (it was awesome!) and ran 1h 40m 56s (4’47” min/km pace).

I ran a negative split. Went out at 5’10”-15” min/km pace. Ran the first 10k in 50’30” (so 5’03” min/km pace) and the last 10k in 45’05” (so 4’30” min/km pace). My last 5k in the race was around 21’30” (4’18/“ min/km pace) and the last km I averaged sub-4 min/km pace. 
Also, I crossed the halfway point in 52’57” meaning that if I hadn’t sped up I would have finished in 1h46min. Ran the second half in 47-48 minutes.

Leading up to the HM, I feel like I trained the bare minimum to do decently. Due to life commitments as well as me wanting to dedicate my time also to other sports (mainly rock climbing) I didn’t follow a training plan and I was never running more than 3-4 times/week in the 3 months leading up to the race. My runs were mostly easy runs (between 5’25-5’50 min/km pace) with some long runs (between 13km and 16km, longest one was 18km) thrown in every week or two. I had never run more than 18km before race day. I did not do intervals/strides/fartleks/hills (aside from a couple interval sessions in the 2 weeks before the race). I did maybe 3-4 tempos (15-18min long ones) in total.

2 months ago I ran a 5K TT to gauge my fitness (hadn’t trained for it though and wasn’t planning on running it, I just felt like it during what was supposed to be a normal run). I ran 20’59” (4’12”/km pace). 


NEXT GOALS:
After the 20’59” 5k in June (my PB in the 5k) and the 1h 40m 56s HM this week, I am wondering what I should aim for next! I would like to work a bit on 5k and 10k times before running another HM. I’m just unsure on what realistic (yet ambitious) goals I could set for myself. 


- As to 10k distance, I am thinking of running a 10k in around 8 weeks from now. What time could I aim for? I ran the last 10k of my HM in 45’05” but I wasn’t pacing myself evenly at all, as I ran a negative split. With 8 weeks of decent training (by which I mean training that also includes some speed work, and hovers around 40km/week) and better pacing, what time could I aim for in a 10k? 

- Also, what about a 5k? Considering I ran 20’59” with no speed training 2 months ago and that now I’m in better shape than I was in June, do you think it would be feasible to attempt a sub-20 min 5k in a few weeks? That would be MASSIVE for me! Just the idea of running sub-4 min/km pace for 5k scares me though ahah! What do you think?

&gt; Jake told Runner's World UK that 'not a lot' was going through his head while he ran the race: 'I think I was just enjoying it all too much and helping the guy in 2nd. When I looked at my watch at mile 17 and saw how fast we were still going I knew I had to finish.' 

&gt; 'I just went for it and thankfully it paid off,' he added. 'It’s a long time running and if you’re too serious you don’t run well. So I was just having a good time, trying to stay relaxed.' 

&gt; **Smith’s previous longest distance was 19 miles.** According to his coach, James Thie, he ran the race with little of the usual marathon preparation or race fuel – **taking on no drinks and only one gel.**

Selected quotes from [Run Creature](https://runcreature.com/an-accidental-marathon-jaryd-clifford-sets-a-new-world-record-in-his-unbelievable-debut/):

&gt; Jaryd Clifford never expected to run more than 20 km this past Sunday (25 April). The star 1500 and 5000-metre runner was lining up at Athletics Australia’s so-called Tokyo Qualification marathon in western Sydney, not as a competitor, but as a pacer for his teammate and hero, Michael Roeger. 

&gt; At 36 km, with his legs well and truly feeling the hurt, Clifford thought his job was finally done. He slowed to a walk, and watched as Roeger carried on down the course. He eventually sat down on the ground, and for a moment, even lay flat on his back. But before he could catch his breath, his coach — who had run over to him — was hollering: “What are you doing? You have to finish this now.” And so, without a second thought, he was back on his feet, pounding the pavement, in hot pursuit of Roeger.

&gt; ""I figured I could probably make it that far without doing any specific work. We did one practice session after nationals last week, which was 3 x 2km at 3:15/km average pace. That was the longest workout I did leading up.""

&gt;""In January, I would have done one, maybe two, 30 km runs. But that’s probably the last significant long run I did. I have had some 20km tempo runs at around marathon pace. My weekly mileage recently has been probably on average between 80 to 100 km.""

&gt; ""Another thing that’s notable is the fuelling. I had two sips of Maurten at three points in the race: the 5, 10 and 15 km marks, because Philo was picking up bottles. But after Philo dropped out I didn’t have any sips of anything. I had one gel 20 minutes before the race, not much for breakfast, and that was basically my only nutrition.""

&gt; ""Coming across the finish line was genuinely one of the most insane feelings. I collapsed on the ground and my stomach — my whole body — was shaking and convulsing. It was a mammoth effort just getting there in the last 5km to finish, and then to hear I’d run under 2:20. It was just shock and disbelief. It wasn’t euphoria, it was more like, What just happened? What did I just do?""

---

**The takeaway:**

We shouldn't be surprised that elite middle/long distance runners are capable of amazing performances. Furthermore, we know that most middle/long distance runners are doing similar training, with mileage of up to 160 km / 100 mi.

I like the notion that sometimes we over-think things, that we can over-analyse, over-plan, etc.. In these two instances, with no intention of completing a marathon (and no fuelling/training plan in support), we have seen elite times and performances. In Smith's case, he won the race. In Clifford's event, he set a world record for the [T-12 athletics category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2_(classification)#Athletics).

On the other hand, it makes you wonder the times both could have achieved (and could still achieve... Clifford is competing in the Tokyo Paralympics, in the 1500m, 5000m, and the marathon!), with more specific training and fuelling. Given the times that were achieved, it is clear that both their performance ceilings have yet to be reached.

If anyone has any comments regarding their nontraditional fuelling strategies, I'd be interested to understand how they both managed given their low energy intakes.",1630022854

But I've noticed that rather than heat affecting me by a gradual worsening, it is more like flipping a switch, where I am fine up until temp X and humidity Y but *suddenly* at that point there is a HUGE impact. Beyond that threshold I almost can't even run anymore, no matter how much I slow my pace.

AdvancedRunning,Dull_Cheesecake4982,Any tips on how to better pace manage?,"I attempted a 5k time trial to gauge my aerobic fitness and clocked 18:42. Here are my splits (in min/km) 3:40, 3:42, 3:57, 3:45, 3:38. you can see that massive slowdown in right in the middle. So the weird thing is, when i started out, about 1.5km in I was sure I will blow out early if i continued at that pace so I decide to hold off the pace. 

 I dropped off quite abit for the 3rd k to get myself a little more comfortable. I felt not too bad close to the end of the 3rd and told myself i could tune it up abit for the 4th, and tune up again for the 5th to end strong. looking back, i could run the 4th just 5sec off the 1st and the 5th even faster than the 1st meant I could have energy managed way more efficiently.

Question is, how do you gauge how much you dial back your pace when you start a little too fast? I think my estimation was way off, but I did it mostly on feel. Do you guys rely on data to judge whats a good point to fall back to like HR or power?

AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Coe's Infamous Rivelin Valley 800s,"Likely popularized from the ""Sebastian Coe Born to Run"" documentary (or perhaps Better Training For Distance Runners by Peter), Seb's 800 meter repeats on Rivelin Valley Road are a bit of a legend. For those unfamiliar, you can find an example of him performing these repeats at about the 20 minute mark of this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5D0XzOcQkM).

Seb purportedly ran 6-8 of these repeats in under 2 minutes each, with limited recovery time between sets (he states that if he caught his dad on a good day, he could squeeze a minute and a half rest). This would be \~3-4 miles at faster than his 2 mile pace, *while running uphill*.

Observations:

\- Seb's form is nearly flawless (for him anyways) despite the gradient and his turnover is still surprisingly high while climbing as well, which I always found interesting.

\- The gradient obviously isn't too steep, but still steep enough that the car climbs over the crest of the hill to meet the camera at 20:35. So we can see that he's not running flat 800s.

Now I personally love of hill running for a variety of reasons, but I'd like to hear from you all:

\- Have you ever tried replacing any of your track workout with long hill repeats? Did you find it useful? 

\- What benefit do you think this specific workout provides over performing the same repeats on the flats (or hot take - would Seb have been faster if he trained on a track)?

\- How often would you perform such a workout compared to a track day? Would you do it all year round?

\- Where are the diminishing returns for this type of training. At 400 meter repeats? 800m? 1600m? Longer?",1629941373

I started running about 2.5 years ago and have continued to progressively improve upon my PB's

* 10k from 45m04s (May 2019) to 38m04s (August 2021) 
* HM from 1h44m30s (June 2019) to 1h33m57s (August 2019) to 1h28m30s (February 2020) to 1h23m37s (August 2021) 

Before this year's training block, I was not following any training block and just running by feel. Trying to get some long runs in while increasing my pace when I felt like it. However, about 3 months ago I started to follow the Pfitz 18/55 Marathon plan for my upcoming Marathon next month in September where I hope to go sub-3. 

The 10K and HM PB's were set in the middle of my 18/55 Marathon Plan. 

I'm enjoying Pftiz's plan but for my next goal, I would like to go sub 1h20m in the HM and wanted to ask for your advice on what training plan you would recommend. If sub 1h20m is not possible, then sub 1h22m would be great as well. 

* Would prefer a 12 week plan - although I could do a 18 week plan if the first 3 weeks are easy. Seems like Hanson's Beginner HM plan is like this. I will be traveling on Week 16 through 18 of any 18 week training plan
* Due to my schedule, would prefer a plan of maximum 60 mile (100 km) weeks 
* I've really enjoyed the speed training in the 18/55 plan and would prefer a plan that has this - from what I can see, seems like Hanson's plan is like this? 
* I currently own Faster Road Racing by Pete Pfitzinger and have been checking out the 12 week 31 to 47 miles (50 - 76km) plan. Seems like there's a lot of focus on longer LT runs.

### Training
This race was a tune up race I had planned for Week 10 of an 18 week marathon training plan I threw together. Haven't done much speed work or quality tempo runs since I've been trying to add on more mileage and avoid injury. Previous long run before this race was 12 miles and averaging about 25-30 miles per week. Missed like two weeks of training because I got married in July and had my honeymoon.

### Pre-race
Honestly, didn't really know what to expect! Haven't ran in a race environment that I've trained for since high school cross country (7 years ago). Haven't ran two weeks in a row since then either. Starting from scratch basically!
Woke up 1 hours before starting time. Had some fruit and coffee and drove 15 minutes to the starting line to pick up my bib. Did some light jogging and a little stretching to pass the time. Had some pretty big nerves since this was my debut back to running.

### Race
As soon as the horn went off I ran the nerves out. Had a nice jump at the beginning but slowed myself since my race plan was to coast 8 minutes per mile the entire race. My ego was really kicking my ass as other runner were passing me but it was only the first mile and had a long way to go. Felt really strong the first half. My wife and parents came out to support me but must have had problems finding spectator spots since I didn't see them until the turn around at 6 miles. Mile 9 had a huge almost spiral staircase like hill that was a pain to get up. Once I reached the top I pushed myself to try and win back some time which is where I think I made my biggest mistake. The only two people I passed after the hill had caught up and passed me by the start of mile 11. All I could do was feel myself moving slower as they were eventually out of sight. Pretty uneventful last two miles. Passed one other runner on the last mile and tried to leave it all out on the last .1 but couldn't get much out of it.

### Post-race
Finished 12th overall and 1st in age (25-29). Wasn't a very competitive event but I really just wanted under 1:45. That is just where I thought I was physically. For not being my goal race and my first race in years. I was happy with the outcome. I'm not where I want to be but I am where I expected to be. Just going to try and do some real consistent training for the Des Moines Marathon in October.

AdvancedRunning,Tremaklus,Really Masters (55+) Breaking 3:00 for the Marathon," 

&gt;I am currently 59 and looking at trying to break 3:00 for the marathon - and actually getting into the award categories at Chicago and Boston next year when I turn 60.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is my (somewhat) lengthy background.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am 6' 1"" and weigh around 157.  Like many here probably did as well, I started as a runner in cross country when I was 12.  I went to a very small school that did not have a track team because we did not have a track (no football team).  Our coach was merely someone who had run before and we had no formal coaching. I did some serious running after I got out of college. In 1987, I had a 17:00 5K pb, and 1:16:53 half marathon pb.  I have always been better at longer than shorter races and can generally maintaining a faster pace at longer distances than my shorter distances would predict.  That same year I ran the Columbus Marathon, but made the rookie mistake of going out at a sub 6:00 pace, died at 20 miles and walk/ran (mostly waked) to a finish in 3:05 and change. After that, life took over and my running took a back seat. Then from 2001 to 2013 I decided I was tired of being so thin (I weighed about 145 at the time). I began seriously lifting weights, got up to as high as 195, and then generally settled around 185. In 2013, I started back up with my running and ran the Columbus Marathon in 2014 with a time of 3:06:59, which I lowered in 2015 to 3:06:07 (53 at the time, averaging around 50 mpw). I ran Boston the next year, but died and the next 1 1/2 years were a waste - I had no energy and could hardly finish long runs. I finally got back on track in 2018, ran the Flying Pig Marathon in 3:09:04, which is a very hilly course. I was doing well and was set to run the Columbus Marathon that fall where I was expecting to finish (based on my training) under 3:05, but the Monday before the race I pulled my left hamstring. That then turned into a sympathetic right hip injury that I stupidly ran through for the next six months.  In May of 2019, I stumbled during a run, jarred down hard on my right leg and - OUCH - my nagging pain in my right hip became a major pain.  
&gt;  
&gt;I could not run at all for the next 4 months.  I slowly worked back up and by early this year was running long runs at an relatively comfortable pace of around 7:45 mpm.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am currently following the Hanson advanced plan in training for the Cincinnati Flying Pig Marathon on October 31.  I am in week 9 of the program and an feeling good that I am in condition for a sub 3:10 even on the hilly course.  The only tweaks I am planning is maybe bumping a couple of the long runs to 18.  My mileage averages around 50 mpw year rounds, I am currently in the 60 mpw range and I don't take days off (I have taking days off).  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is where my questions come in to any 55+ runners that have made it under 3:00.  My plan is to run Chicago in the fall of 2022 with a goal of under 3:00 that should safely put me into the award category (top 5) for the 60-64 age group, and then Boston in the spring of 2023 with a goal of under 2:56 to likely be enough to again be in the award category (top 3) in the 60-64 age group.    
&gt;  
&gt;For my next block - spring of 2022 - should I focus on a half marathon to build up better speed?  Should I do another marathon block to get under 3:05?  Should I look at a Pfitz plan rather than Hanson - in 2014 and 2015 I followed the plan from ""Mastering the Marathon"" by Don Fink - or try something else?  My 5K speed is not good - should I focus on that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",1629826759

I’m training for Wineglass on 10/3. That gives me not quite six weeks of training. Where should i focus my efforts for the next four weeks before taper? Should I be thinking of adjusting my goals?

I’ve been using a modified pfitz 18/55. Peak mileage around 45 MPW with 6 days of exercise but two are non-running for injury prevention. I have crushed the track/speed work and kept up on the long runs (up to 16), though tempos are harder bc of heat. However. I had to take all of last week off to heal some Patella Tendinitis. 

Im getting back up to speed now but likely will be dropping down to one quality workout a week until race week. That brings me to my question: should I focus on just completing my long runs and do my speed work? Or forgo speed work to do the marathon paced long runs (like the 18 mile with 10 @ MP)?

Lastly, should I start reconsidering my goals? This is marathon #3. PB is 3:03 and I am gunning for 2:57 and a BQ.",1629825583
AdvancedRunning,MikeTeeV,Running really fast downhill,"I came third in a half marathon trail race on Sunday after leading the entire way, and after analysing my pacing against the two runners that passed me on the final 2km massive descent, this is where I lost it. I have faster flat 5km times than both, so it's not lacking pace, I just hit my decent 'terminal velocity' about 30s/km slower than they did, and they went by my like a train. I physically couldn't run any faster. It has really annoyed me. 

It has to be technique. Anyone have any thoughts/resources on how to work on this?",1629801011
AdvancedRunning,-tuna_,How slow is too slow?,"Im training for the 5k and in an effort to increase my weekly mileage I have started doing longer runs. However I live in a very hilly area (\~200 feet of elevation difference from start to finish) and because I'm trying to keep my running at an ""easy"" pace, I aim to keep my heart rate below 140 and stay in a zone where I am able to hold a conversation as I run. The problem is that some of these hills are so steep that just walking up them takes me to a 150 heart rate. (partially because of the heat)

I have read that staying at a conversational pace and in zone 1-2 of your heart rate is optimal for a base training phase, but I have also read that it is possible to run too slow during your easy runs so I assume by walking every uphill and waiting to recover below a 140 HR before I start running again is undermining my attempts of increasing my aerobic capacity on my longer runs. 

So what should I prioritize, heart rate, or running continuity? 

And is walking okay if I'm heart rate training? I mean my heart and lungs don't know if I'm running or walking, so is it all the same?",1629790862

\### Training

This race was a tune up race I had planned for Week 10 of an 18 week marathon training plan I threw together. Haven't done much speed work or quality tempo runs since I've been trying to add on more mileage and avoid injury. Previous long run before this race was 12 miles and averaging about 25-30 miles per week. Missed like two weeks of training because I got married in July and had my honeymoon.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Honestly, didn't really know what to expect! Haven't ran in a race environment that I've trained for since high school cross country (7 years ago). Haven't ran two weeks in a row since then either. Starting from scratch basically! 

&amp;#x200B;

Woke up 1 hours before starting time. Had some fruit and coffee and drove 15 minutes to the starting line to pick up my bib. Did some light jogging and a little stretching to pass the time. Had some pretty big nerves since this was my debut back to running.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

As soon as the horn went off I ran the nerves out. Had a nice jump at the beginning but slowed myself since my race plan was to coast 8 minutes per mile the entire race. My ego was really kicking my ass as other runner were passing me but it was only the first mile and had a long way to go. Felt really strong the first half. My wife and parents came out to support me but must have had problems finding spectator spots since I didn't see them until the turn around at 6 miles. Mile 9 had a huge almost spiral staircase like hill that was a pain to get up. Once I reached the top I pushed myself to try and win back some time which is where I think I made my biggest mistake. The only two people I passed after the hill had caught up and passed me by the start of mile 11. All I could do was feel myself moving slower as they were eventually out of sight. Pretty uneventful last two miles. Passed one other runner on the last mile and tried to leave it all out on the last .1 but couldn't get much out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Finished 12th overall and 1st in age (25-29). Wasn't a very competitive event but I really just wanted under 1:45. That is just where I thought I was physically. For not being my goal race and my first race in years. I was happy with the outcome. I'm not where I want to be but I am where I expected to be.

### Training
I am in a 5k cycle with some goal efforts comings up in September. Original goal of the cycle was to try and get under 15. Things were really clicking through mid-July and then some pretty bad patellar tendinitis set me back for a bit and, when combined with some pretty humid/hot weather, shattered my confidence. Workouts and mileage have been sketchy the last month with some going great and others not going as planned. I also tried a 3000 TT on the track 2 weeks ago and my knee locked up and I had to call it quits after 800 or so. All-in-all confidence hadn’t been great but I felt a consistent week or two of training and decided to give another TT a shot. 

### Pre-race
I really wanted to take the pressure off for this rust buster given the above context and because it was the first time doing a race effort since my 5k PR back in May. The dew point was also in the mid 70s and I have trouble in the heat so I decided to stay off the track and run on a course with about 90 feet of elevation loss. I also decided to have some more fun with it and try to take it out HARD and see if I could fight through some mental demons.

I woke up at 2:45 AM, crept downstairs so I wouldn’t wake up the kids, pounded some coffee, grabbed my backpack and headed out the door. The walk down to the trail is about 5 minutes so I just listened to some tunes and tried to chill. By the time I got down there I was already pretty sweaty so I pounded a Gatorade and started my warmup. 

2 miles easy, 1 uphill on the course and then 1 back down went by quickly. Before I knew it I found myself changing into my Next%2s, taking off my headphones and heading back uphill into the night to finish my warmup. I clicked off a 5:44 mile, walked a bit, did 3 75m or so strides continuing up the gradual incline of the course and then finished off my warm up with 200m or so at 3-5k pace. I walked the remaining quarter mile or so up to the start line, calmed myself down and got my farming workout programmed to take 3 1k splits ready before heading out.

### Race
I hit the start button on my watch and took off hard. I knew right away I was probably a bit quick but I avoided the urge to look at my lap pace until I knew I was about 400m in. Shit… 4:17 pace. Right at that point I throttled but just as the course flattened out for the next 400 meters or so. I cruised through 800 meters and just focused on staying relaxed before the course dropped off again for the next 200 meters. My watch beeped 4 times and then buzzed and when I looked down at my last split I saw 2:52. A bit faster than I wanted. 

I tried to just focus on staying mechanical and zoning out for the next 1k. I don’t think I even looked at my watch. This portion was a long straight with a gradual decline that went under a few bridges. It is one of my favorite sections of the trail. It was around this time that I felt myself seriously starting to feel the humidity. I cruised by the mile marker and knew I was 400 out from the next split. I went up and over a bridge and the beeping started again. Then a buzz. 3:04. I had slowed down way more than I should have.

I threw in a surge to try to get back on pace and started looking at my watch every 50 meters. I saw the avg. lap pace drop from 5:20 to 5:10 to 5:00 to 4:50 before finally settling in at 4:47. I wasn’t really tying up but I just didn’t really have the will power to go any faster than that. I was stupidly staring at my watch a ton and kind of took my mind out of the effort a bit more than I should have. I passed some weird dude walking down the trail towards me smoking a cigarette (remember this is like 3:45 AM). I thought about how weird he must think I am grunting loudly, sweating like an animal running 4:45 mile pace down a commuter bike path in the middle of the night wearing nothing but half tights. The smoke made me gag. Before I knew it I was 200 meters out and I just focused on maintaining control and finishing with solid form. No real kick to be found. I heard the final beeps and the buzz and stopped my watch a moment later. I saved the activity, pulled the splits up and did the math in my head and calculated it out to 8:55.5

### Post-race
Not great. Not terrible. Pretty much what I was hoping for. I cooled down 2 miles and walked home just as my 4 year old son was waking up. We snuck passed my sleeping wife and he chilled in the bathroom with me while I took a shower and I told him about the race. We then snuck downstairs and made pancakes.

AdvancedRunning,Albertos_Dog,[Somewhat Hypothetical] Selecting a City/Town for Running,"Let’s say you’re a fully remote worker, looking to find a place to relax, enjoy, and train. Let’s say you also want reasonable (&lt;2 hour) airport access and reliable communications/internet infrastructure. Further, let’s assume you want a place for great running, without having to drive to too many specific locations (i.e., this city is great if you just run in ____ park reserve) or deal with a population that can’t support it (i.e. every road is a two lane highway with no shoulder).

AdvancedRunning,NotAtTheTable,Question around fitting a half marathon+vacay into a pfitz 18/55 marathon training plan,"Hi all,

So I'm running the San Jose rock&amp;roll half marathon on October 3rd, while also training for the Dallas Marathon on December 12th (the primary goal). This would put the half marathon on the sunday of week 10, which is a 54 mile week consisting of 

27-Sep	M	Rest

28-Sep	T	Rec + Sp 7 w/ 6 x 100 strides

29-Sep	W	MLR 12

30-Sep	Th	Rest

1-Oct	F	LT 10 w/ 6 @ 15K to HMP

2-Oct	Sa	Rec 5

3-Oct	Su	LR 20

First question, how would you shuffle around the week to best service the half marathon (read: not get hurt) while still racing this a bit as a test of fitness. Could I just do the runs as prescribed, skip the taper and then maybe have an easier week after to adjust as little as possible?

Second question is how would you load balance the week after, which currently consists of:

4-Oct	M	Rest

5-Oct	T	Rec 6

6-Oct	W	MLR 14

7-Oct	Th	Rec 6 

8-Oct	F	Rest

9-Oct	Sa	Rec + Sp 6 w/ 6 x 100 strides

10-Oct	Su	MP 16 w/ 12 @ MP

I'm thinking I should be able to just jump back in (maybe?) or maybe cut out the Wednesday 14 miler and just focus on some recovery miles or something? (I'll also be on vacation so cutting out the 14 miler would be something my wife would be excited about).

Okay one more question - should I potentially swap the sunday runs for these two weeks? Replace the 16 w/12 @ marathon pace with the half, and then do a 20 miler after I get back home?

I'm probably overthinking this a touch - two weeks where I'm still getting good mileage in and racing isn't ""lost fitness"" but I think you lot are pretty bright, so I wanted to get your thoughts on how to best optimize the plan.

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks fam.",1629743505
AdvancedRunning,jg8tes,Is it unhealthy or unsafe to maintain zone 5 HR for extended periods of time?,"I just did 6 miles last night at 8:30 pace. Longest distance of the season but I run 730-8 min miles pretty consistently. It felt fine, but after the run I couldn't stop sweating for over an hour. According to my Garmin my hr was 185-195 basically the whole run. Today I am extremely exhausted and wondering if I've put myself at risk. The generic info I've found on hr zones indicates that 5 is unsustainable. I find that my hr stays in zone 2 for about 5 min and then jumps to zone 5 and stays there no matter what pace I'm running.

AdvancedRunning,Albertos_Dog,Is there a medium between AdvancedRunning and LetsRun?,"Both forums have definite merits - namely, less toxicity and trolling here, which leads me to read these forums.

On this flip side, we have LetsRun (speaking specifically of the boards, obviously). There’s some immense abrasiveness there, and you often have to wade through pages of negativity/toxicity to get to the good content… but when you find it, I think it’s much better - LRC has input from athletes and coaches of the highest caliber, and has some immensely good threads on training from runners who are seeking to be HS/college champions, professional runners, OTQers, etc.

AdvancedRunning,newguy3912,Question about returning from injury..,"My question requires a little back story.. so here goes.  

About 3 months ago, I was at peak fitness.  I trained super hard for a half marathon and managed to run a 1:22 (\~6:13/m).  This was the culmination of my pandemic training program, which allowed me to train basically everyday (and on some days - twice a day).  This is a VERY fast time for me.  I am also an avid cyclist and (for those who are in that world) had an FTP of \~ 4.1w/kg.

Anyway, in mid-June I got hit by a car while riding my bike that resulted in a broken collarbone that which surgery to repair.  I had to take 2 months completely off while the shoulder healed.  I started running two weeks (Aug 9).  Ran 3 miles at 8min/mile and was more sore the next day than after I ran my 1:22 HM.  I'm slowly getting back into the flow of training... but my question is, what is a reasonable time frame to return to my prior fitness?  

In my head, I had a goal of targeting a 1:22 HM in April 2022... so that's 8 months of training.  Too conservative.. too aggressive?  Those who have been through this., any training tips would also be appreciated.",1629733802

AdvancedRunning,EducationalTeaching,Has worrying about your form and cadence ever made you slower?,"The context here is I'm trying to get back into the shape I was in just over a year ago and find it's really hard to even tempo for 5 miles at the pace I've run a marathon at.  I guess I've fallen into the trap of trying to throw too many elements into my training such as incorporating form pointers from dozens of youtube videos and perhaps mentally wearing myself out from trying to run a certain way.  

For example, still don't know what the optimal arm carriage is (I'm 6'1 and have thin lanky arms) and worried that my easy day pace is slowly drifting into the 9-930 range whereas in all my prior training blocks (even with some at altitude) my easy/recovery pace rarely drifted beyond 830.

# Background

My (22 m) background in running is very minimal, but in 2020 my farthest distance was a half marathon. I had to cut it short in 2020 because I started to develop ITB syndrome. I made it a goal for 2021 to come back strong and develop a more efficient running gait. I didn't really have any sights on racing in this marathon but it was definitely in my bucket list. I continued to follow my habit of running 3x a week and up to 5x a week, and fell in love with this hobby.

# Training

My first run of 2021 was in April. The first long run was of the yearabout 10 km and that was already miserable for me. I slowly built up my mileage each week, following about the 10% rule, and my long runs became longer and longer by \~2-3 km each run. Things were going quite well for me. However, I never incorporated any strides, fartleks, etc. because I wasn't familiar with these at the time. Most of my runs were at consistent paces throughout, but I knew well enough that some runs during the week should be faster, and the majority are steady easy (hard days hard, easy days easy). Easy runs were definitely not kept easy lol, ran them at about \~5:30 km/min pace. But they did feel easy on my body. I started from 17.3 km/week, and my peak was 105.2 km/week (96.6 km and 84.1 km the previous weeks). I had plans to hold the 105 km for another 2 weeks, however, I suffered a calf (soleus) strain with about 5 weeks left until my planned race date. To keep it short, possible sources of injury are over-training, lack of sleep, and a squishy, high stack height shoe I was using on a very bouncy treadmill. I put the excuses aside and worked my butt off to rehab as safely but quickly as I could. I cross-trained with swimming and biking during my off-time, and come the 2nd week, I was back on my legs with very light running. I was surprised I was able to come back this quickly, but there was still some lingering pain so I continued my rehab with some running. I managed to bump my training and taper to 80 km/week, trusting that my aerobic abilities were well trained before my injury.

# Pre-race

Lots and lots of excitement! Planned start time was 7am. Set my alarm for 4am, didn't wake up until 5am. I ate 1/2 cup oatmeal and a banana. During the week before race day, I ate my normal meals, but ate lots of pasta and followed Coach Kyle's taper and carb-loading plan. I didn't have much water, maybe less than 1 L. I did a 1km shakeout and ate some candy 20 minutes before go time.

# The race

I was very surprised with my first split. I realized that was too fast for me because I haven't trained much at that pace. Heck, my plan was to split 4:45 km/min for my race. I stepped it back a bit and found myself even splitting 4:25-4:30. This is when I decided that this is what I'm going to hold and stick with how my body is feeling. During the race, my body and mental was holding up great. I had my uncle supporting me on a bike so he passed me the bottles. My first drink (water) was at about 2 km and I continued with sips at about every 4 km, sometimes at shorter intervals. I switched to Gatorade at 10 km. First nutrition (sour watermelon gummies) was taken at 8 km. I used gummies because I was too cheap to buy and train with gels. Nutrition plan was to take in carbs every 5-6 km afterwards. My memory is a bit short on the exact details. I started to take in my uncle's gels (Huma) at kilometer 25. I didn't experience much cramping throughout the run. I had browsed on Reddit that the ""wall"" is at about the 30 kilometer mark, and I was very wary of that haha. Mediocre fatigue was felt  at kilometer 34, and that's where you can see in the splits I was starting to hurt - I couldn't take my mind off the finish line!

# Post-race

I was so so so thrilled with how the race went. My mind was flooding with thoughts and emotions because this has been a rollercoaster for me. Running has carried me through some hard times so I'm very grateful I was able to achieve this. I wouldn't say that my body was absolutely destroyed, just some minor stiffness throughout my legs. However, I have a baseball sized blister on my heel. Very excited for continuing with this hobby. :)",1629677276

AdvancedRunning,Owlertonil,Any Type 1 Diabetic Runners Here?,"I’m a T1D, and I’m finding I have some challenges getting my blood sugars right for morning races. Typically, I wake up with a blood sugar somewhere between 80 and 140, often on the lower end of the range. Given my usual habits, I know if I don’t eat anything, I’ll drop low during a race. If I eat something, though, I have to get the amount right, the timing right, and the bolts (if any) right. If I don’t, I can find my sugar climbing high and if I go out too fast, my legs feel it very fast. 

Today I had a 10k and went out too fast - when I got back to my car my CGM showed I’d been high sugar throughout. This wasn’t my only problem, but was definitely one of them. I find this especially hard in the morning, because if I take too much of a bolus I know I’ll be hitting a low. But if I eat too much my belly will be full and impact a hard effort.

Anyone here who’s had to develop strategies for this?",1629649469

AdvancedRunning,j_hx_w,Reacclimating to running as an ex-runner,"Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. I was a decent (for my state) distance runner in high school (4:44 1600, 16:19 5k), but then I stopped running after I graduated. This year, almost 10 years since my last high school XC race, I started to run again. I was running 1-3x a week for 4-8 miles per run, around 8:00 min/mi pace. I saw very gradual improvement in that my pace started getting quicker and I was able to incorporate some long runs too. 

Now 3 months of running have gone by and one day I decide to push the pace on 12 mile long run, and I end up averaging 6:45 min/mi. I was really shocked because I never imagined I would ever get back into semi-decent running fitness again, especially so soon.

I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience before? Is there any research that indicates people who’ve achieved certain levels of fitness at some point in the past can regain that fitness faster than someone who has not held that level of fitness before?

And for more context, in the 10 years I stopped running, I’ve been relatively healthy (+15lb my high school weight, mostly muscle) but have done no cardio exercise, only light weightlifting (~3 years) and boxing (~2 years).

Final thoughts: after that 12 mi long run, my legs were extremely sore for a few days and my IT band, arches, achilles, and shins were very irritated. I was probably close to getting injured, so I guess I find it surprising that my mind was able to push myself to go at a pace/distance that my physical body clearly wasn’t ready to do. I wonder if this is another common phenomena ex-runners experience: your mind thinks you’re still the fast runner you used to be, so it defaults to pushing your body at your old pace?",1629635190

AdvancedRunning,djc0,Running while dealing with ongoing chemo … looking for shared experience and training advice/adjustments,"I know this might be a bit of an unusual post. But I’ve been on chemo/immuno drugs for the past ~2 years now, along with a stem cell (aka bone marrow) transplant last year. But throughout working hard to keep my running up when I can. 

It’s hard to find people going through similar experiences and how they adjust and cope. Recovering from the more serious treatment aside (the SCT was about 6 months), the side effects from some of the drugs/drug combinations have played havoc with my max HR, overall HR, oxygen transport/breathing, recovery/sleep … not to mention overheating (even when the weather is cold). Training has had to change (along with my expectations). 

For me I’m managing lenalidomide, daratumuamb, and dexamethasone on a daily/weekly basis. Before all this I was running 3000-4000km per year and have done 15 marathons. Losing all that base was hard but I’m so far back up to over 1000km for the year so far. My easy pace before was around 5:45/km with average HR 140’ish bpm, now ~8:00/km at ~155bpm. Max HR changes depending on drugs and dosage, but can go from ~180bpm to 165bpm over the course of a month. It’s weird.

### Final time: 18:15

The Opaskwayak Indigenous Days Foot race is an annual race held during Opaskwayak Cree Nation's annual festival in northern Manitoba, Canada.  It's a small, very loosely organized race, but because the race is sponsored by the band, there are insane cash prizes to be won, and for the past few years I've been running in this race annually as a side hustle.  I won the 2018 and 2019 races (2020 was cancelled), and at that time the race format was a road race of about 14 km in length.  This year, likely because the festival was sort of thrown together last minute, they held it on the local track and made it a 4800m race, and instead of a mass start, they did separate heats for age groups and genders (under 17, 18-50, 50+, male and female).  First prize for this race was a cool $800.

### Training
I didn't do any specific training for this race, I'm currently in the middle of a home brewed Chicago Marathon training plan, running 55-65 mpw with one weekly workout (some variation of either lactate threshold intervals, critical velocity intervals, or a tempo progression run starting at marathon pace and finishing at 10k pace), one stride session, and a long run, running 7 days a week.  Lately been running one or two days of doubles just due to family and other commitments.  I wasn't even sure that this race was going to happen until about a week ago, and the 4800m track race was totally unexpected, but I rolled with it because I knew I was in good shape and also the 2 time reigning champ so still a favourite to win.

### Pre-race
I was a little bit more nervous than usual about this race, as I haven't run a track race since high school (and back then I was not competitive), and I am far less dominant at shorter distances, being more of a long distance specialist.

Then life threw a couple curve balls at me.  On Thursday by 3 year old daughter caught a stomach bug and spent most of the day throwing up.  I came home from work and consoled her by cuddling with her and napping with her for most of the day.  I thought it a bit odd that I spent about 5 hours in the middle of the day napping, and felt more tired than usual.  Then on Friday I woke up and realized I also had the stomach bug, and spent most of the day flat on my back between trips to the bathroom.  I didn't eat much more than half a bowl of oatmeal and a popsicle that day.  I had to let my 119 day run streak die, that gives you a bit of an idea of how rotten I felt.  By Friday night I was starting to feel a bit better, although pretty weak and my back was pretty sore from laying down all day.  I wasn't sure if I would even make it to the race, let alone race to anywhere near the best of my ability.

I woke up Saturday not feeling sick, but my back was in a real state.  Looking in the mirror, my pelvis was lopsided and I couldn't bend to my left.  When I tried to put shorts on, I almost fell down when I tried to lift my right leg.  I was pretty certain my right SI joint was seized up, but the race wasn't until 2 in the afternoon and it didn't feel inflamed, just really tight so I spent most of the morning stretching it out.  Did a 2 mile easy shakeout run and it didn't feel great and I felt like I was running lopsided, but I felt like things were starting to slowly loosen up.  Luckily, by the time the race rolled around, I was mostly loosened up, and all I had to worry about was whether I had it in me to put out a 5k effort after being sick the day before.

The track we were racing on was not in great shape.  It was mostly gravel but overgrown with weeds in several sections, and there were a few exposed rocks that they were kind enough to spraypaint for visibility.  I had meant to run the track on Thursday or Friday to get a feel for it as I had never run on it before, but obviously that wasn't in the cards.

I sized up my competition before the race started - it ended up being a pretty small field, only 6 racers in total.  Of those, only 2 other guys looked like they would pose a challenge - one young guy with a rainbow coloured afro, and a blonde guy my age who looked to be in decent shape.  My strategy as discussed with a few running buddies would be to stay near the front of the pack for the first mile or two and then pull away for the last mile.

### Race
The start of the race consisted of all of us lining up at the red spraypainted line on the track while one of the race marshalls said ""okay, on your marks..."" and the other race marshall abruptly yelling ""go"" without warning.  Rainbow Fro and Blonde Guy took off at blazing speed and my initial reaction was ""uh oh, they're going to make me work for this"".  I let them take the lead and followed them within striking distance at a somewhat unsustainable pace, but I had a feeling that this might be inexperienced pacing on their part.  After about 500m my suspicions were confirmed, Blonde Guy fell back somewhat abruptly and by 600m I was in the lead and creating separation.

I maintained a workmanlike pace for the next lap or two.  I wanted to set the tone for the race and make anybody who wanted to hang with me uncomfortable.  I resolved to not look over my shoulder, but to continue at the pace I was at until I could see Rainbow Fro on the other side of the track from me, which would indicate a comfortable 200+m lead.  I lapped my first competitor before the 800m mark, and by roughly the fourth lap I could see that I had the cushion I wanted and I could see Rainbow Fro's form was already starting to break down a little.  At that point I was pretty certain I had the race in the bag barring some misfortune, and I eased off the effort just a little and cruised for the rest of the race.

I think by lap 7 or 8 I had lapped the entire field at least once, and I was happy to note that I was feeling pretty decent.  Running more closely to my 10k pace but I was happy with that considering how messed up I was the day before.  I sped up for the bell lap just because I could and finished the race with about a 600m lead for a comfortable win and a relatively easy $800 in my pocket.

### Post-race
I hung out at the finish line to cheer in the rest of the field, we exchanged some back pats and I chatted up a few spectators who were pretty impressed with my performance.  Did a photo op with the Chief and he presented me with a cool little trophy and an envelope full of cash.  Then I hopped in my truck and changed into my baseball gear and went and played in a baseball tournament.

There you have it.  Hopefully I'm feeling good enough tomorrow to get back into my regular routine again because I've got an 18 mile long run planned.

AdvancedRunning,bluearrowil,Are you in the middle of 18-week Pfitz and you're missing runs? You are not alone.,"**TLDR: Missing a couple runs (including longs and workouts) isn't going to destroy your marathon. Listen to your body, if you need a day or two off, take it. Adapting your schedule is part of creating a successful performance.**

Been seeing some posts from some of the community training for Chicago and Boston that's been worried about missing runs, feeling dejected, and not feeling 100%. You are not alone.

When anyone sets out their training calendar, we never prepare for missed runs, unforseen calf tightness, the cranky IT band, sudden loss of motivation. But it happens to everyone. 

Pfitz isn't designed to be easy, the book is literally called ""Advanced Marathoning."" The second block is notorious for being the hardest block. A month ago you might have held marathon pace for 10 miles and now you can barely hold it for a couple minutes. What happened?? What the fuck is going on??

You're searching the subreddit for answers. You're binging papers on dry-needling. Maybe those normatec boots might actually do the trick.

What's happening is you're at your limit and you need to start setting boundaries for yourself. Are easy runs getting harder and harder? Are you barely walking? Now is the time to take a day off. Maybe two. There's a fine line between general training fatigue and being on the brink of injury / overtraining. And trust me, if your gut and your legs are telling you that you need to skip that 20 mile long, listen.

**Personal Anecdote Section**

Last race I trained on Pfitz 18/85, I created at table of what I put down below. In block 2 I missed 20% of the miles including an 18 mile marathon pace long and 6 mile LT workout. I thought I was fucked. Total mileage missed was 73 miles in the block. I had soleus issues that I babysat for weeks.

The goal for that training block was to take my marathon PR down from 3:03 to 2:55. I ended up running a 2:54. It's ok to miss runs.

**Simple Advice: Keep a training journal**  
Write down somewhere at the end of your runs how you feel, good or bad. You missed it? Why? You feel better today? Great write it down. That way next time you train for a race and you start feeling like shit, you can go back and read in your own words and thoughts what worked and didn't, and how you overcome.

Some background context first.
Am 33 year old male runner - plan averages 65km a week and peaks at 75km. Have run a 3.15 marathon but that was 3 years ago and due to kids have dropped a fair bit of fitness and carrying an extra 10-15kg. Aim for this HM is to run 1.45 but if in shape would like to do quicker… 
Am probably in about 21 minute 5km pace currently.
12 week plan that is basically broken down as 
M - Long Run - builds up to 32km
T - Recovery - 4-5km
W - Aerobic 7-10km
T - Session day (what I want ideas for)
F - Recovery 5km
S - 6-7km with a couple of tempo km’s
S - Rest day

So for the session day generally want a workout that is about 10-12km - I do a 2km warm up and a 2km cool down.
So what I currently have in there:
- Yasso 800s
- Fartlek
- 4’/1’
- Hill repeats (the hill I use climbs about 50m over 600m)
- Tempo (5-10km at goal HMP or faster)

In the past have utilised the following too:
- Mile/KM repeats
- Mile breakdowns

So yeah - would love any fresh ideas for a session",1629466112

Second interval was 7:20.  Not horrible.

AdvancedRunning,CoffeeLobster,Running Boston Marathon during marathon training?,"I just got one of [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/oxxty0/boston_marathon_invite/) emails.  Subject line: ""LIMITED SPOTS AVAILABLE FOR IN-PERSON 125th BOSTON MARATHON"".  I tried to register earlier this year with a -7:28 but the cutoff ended up being -7:47, so I missed out by 19 seconds.  I guess there are even more spots opening up now, presumably due to COVID-19 and travel restrictions.  

After my Boston rejection I felt sad for myself for 2 days and then decided to use a deferral code to run CIM in December.  I spent the first 10 weeks of the summer base building up to 60 mpw and I'm into my second week of marathon training now.  I know it's early but so far I'm feeling optimistic about my fitness.       

Is it wise to entertain the idea of running Boston as a (super) long run before CIM?   Or should I stick to my original plan to wait and see if my -7:28 from 2019 gets me into 2022 and (hopefully) run even faster at CIM in December?  

I think I'm leaning towards the second option but would appreciate a sanity check from the more experienced runners here.",1629305929
AdvancedRunning,cslola1994,Advice on running a half &amp; full marathon back-to-back,"Hey everyone!  Recently my partner has decided to try the whole running thing out. We live in Philadelphia and the 2021 marathon is coming up in November, so we decided to run the half marathon together on Saturday, 11/20. However, I am already signed up to run the full marathon on Sunday, 11/21 aka the very next day. Instead of pulling out of the full, I want to take on the challenge of doing the two races back-to-back. I was curious to hear how others who have done this like to prepare or any general advice they might have. **I have NO expectations for timing with either race. They are simply for my enjoyment.** 

For some background: I’m a 26F and have been running since I was 14 years old. I’ve run 10+ half marathons, 1 “ultra half” aka a 15-mile road race, 4 full marathons and 1 trail 50k. During training I usually run 5x/week and do strength/mobility work 3x/week with two full rest days. My weekly mileage varies depending on the distance I am training for. Let me know if there would be any other information you might find useful! Thanks",1629302083

AdvancedRunning,nabuss11,Hanson Strength workout confusion,"32M, 60-80 MPW. First half of this year I followed the Hanson's Half Marathon Method plan en route to running a 1:08 HM. Once I got to the ""strength"" workout weeks, I was caught off guard by how hard they were. First week is 6x mile @ 10 seconds faster than target HM pace, so I was doing them around 5:05/mi. The longer workouts (3x 2 mi, 2x 3 mi) were killer. 

Fast forward to now, I'm following the Hanson (full) Marathon Method and plan to run Boston, target 2:25. First strength workout is the same 6x mile, at 10 seconds faster than target *marathon* pace, so for me about 5:25/mi. This workout was an absolute cakewalk, afterwards I wondered whether I read something wrong. 

So why the big difference? The ""speed"" workouts from Hanson are very similar between the half and full plans, and the tempos are adjusted for the full plan by being slower but also longer. The strength workouts just seem... easier? Recovery between intervals is similar. Wondering whether I should adjust or just focus on getting a quality long run/workout in on a regular basis; I did find during the HM plan I was pretty wiped from the week and the long run was the thing I'd cut back on to recover.",1629299236

* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is 10k Overdistance Intervals**.

https://www.podiumrunner.com/training/workout-week-10k-overdistance-intervals/

*History:*

Ryan Carrara, coach of New Balance Boston, has his athletes do this workout late in the season (4-5 weeks out from goal race).

*Why:*

10k's suck. They consist of the pain of a 5k for double the distance. This will help train you to reign in that sucky-ness. 

*How:*

Warmup + 4x1:00 @ 3k pace w/1:00 recovery + 4x1.5 miles @ 10k pace w/3:00 rest + 4x1:00 @ 3k pace w/1:00 recovery + cooldown. It's like a reverse ice cream sandwich! A sushi roll if you will.

*What:*

The idea is that you will get the feeling of the last bit of a 10k but not the recovery time needed post-race due to the generous rest portions. Try and complete the workout on the surface that your goal race is on (road on roads, cross country on trails, etc).

*When:*

About 4-5 weeks out from a goal 10K and should be done in an environment that is specific to the event you’re targeting",1629294035
AdvancedRunning,ruinawish,"Strength training for runners: a primer, based on contemporary research","While working on the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/wiki/faq), I came across this 2019 infographic called ['Running myth: strength training should be high repetition low load to improve running performance'](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/54/13/813.full.pdf) from the British Journal of Sports Medicine (funnily enough, I've previously been treated by one of the authors involved). It isn't a systematic review/meta-analysis in itself, but presents a few findings from studies in the last few years (in particular, this [systematic review by Blagrove et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889786/pdf/40279_2017_Article_835.pdf)).

While the infographic, and the studies it cites, are well worth a read to understand why strength training can benefit runners, it addressed a few talking points that are often raised on the sub, of which I'll list a few here:

* **Completing endurance type exercises (e.g. 3 sets of 20 reps or more with light resistance) has been reported to be less effective than heavy resistance and explosive resistance training in achieving benefits to running performance. Examples  of heavy resistance exercises commonly utilised include barbell squats, deadlifts, steps- ups, lunges  and calf raise variations.**
 
* **Completing exercises with moderate resistance, for example, 60%–80% of 1 repetition maximum for 3–6 sets of 5–15 repetitions has been reported to benefit performance. For distance runners, training to repetition failure is not recommended.**

'Lift heavy, low reps' is a recommendation that has frequently been mentioned in previous discussions on strength training on the subreddit. However, Blagrove et al., (2018) found that the studies that utilised low reps (3-5) at loads &gt;80% of 1RM ""did not observe superior benefits compared to investigations that prescribed resistance training at moderate loads (60-80% 1RM) and higher repetition ranges (5-15 repetitions)"". 

Similarly, squats and deadlifts are frequently mentioned on the sub, but step ups and calf raises are rarely brought up (the latter usually only mentioned when preventing/managing injuries... the infographic's author mention that the the role of strength training in injury prevention is not well understood).

* **While the addition of two to three supervised  strength sessions per week [will benefit?] (*incomplete text in the PDF*), initially focussing on a periodised heavy resistance training programme is recommended.**

This recommendation once again comes from Blagrove et al., 2018. The emphasis on heavy resistance training is based on studies that suggest ""an advantage long-term in... reducing injury risk and eliciting a more more pronounced training effect"". In addition to heavy resistance training, the authors also discuss other modalities such as explosive resistance training, and plyometric training, acknowledging for the non-strength trained runner, ""any novel strength training stimulus is likely to... induce an adaptation in the short term."" However, no actual practical recommendation is made on what the periodisation should look like.

* **There is no one size fits all approach when it comes to strength training for   endurance runners. Exercise  selection, weight, sets, reps and recovery all depend on the individuals’ needs, injury history, goals, ability and training experience.**

I think this is one of the more important points when it comes to strength training, and a reason why specific strength training questions will usually see a range of answers. The sub seems to see a lot of crossover with users from power lifting/weight lifting backgrounds, and their recommendations/suggestions will very much be based on their experiences with strength training.

* **It is recommended that runners seek the assistance of an experienced health   professional or strength and conditioning coach to ensure they start out safely and   get the most out of their strength training program.**

As with above, you can collect a range of ideas from strangers on the internet, but you won't have anyone tell you whether you're doing an exercise correctly, or how an ideal strength training program can look for you. For example, one of the first questions a physio/sports clinician will ask you when prescribing interventions is: ""Do you have access to a gym? What equipment do you have at home?"". Accordingly, a strength training program can be developed with the resources available to you.

* **Careful programming should allow at least 3 hours recovery after high- intensity running before completing strength training, and at least 24 hours recovery  after strength training before a high-intensity running session is scheduled.**

This covers another frequently asked question on the sub: 'When should I do my strength training'?.

---

In my scanning of contemporary academic literature on the topic, I have not been able to find anything suggesting that one perfect strength training protocol. I imagine it doesn't exist, because there's so many variables when it comes to the exercises, or the characteristics of the runners themselves.

The goal of research studies is usually to find a cause and effect relationship. While systematic reviews then provide a higher level of evidence, being based on multiple studies, it still leaves us with broad findings such as ""completing  exercises with moderate resistance, for example, 60%–80% of 1 repetition maximum for  3–6  sets of 5–15 repetitions has been reported to benefit performance"". Thus, I think this is where having advice from a professional sports clinician/coach is valuable, to interpret the evidence, and provide an intervention best suited to you.

Keen to hear your thoughts on the topic, and if you've come across any resources that support or contradict the ideas presented in this infographic.

Personally, I'm interested to find more information about how exercises involving bodyweight (e.g. [Myrtl routine](https://runnyday.in/myrtl-routine/)) and core strength (here's a [2009 study for example](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2009/01000/does_core_strength_training_influence_running.22.aspx?casa_token=V81OYydxZxsAAAAA:Y1Ye5WDeAv3ztNO8B27hkSgoa4DDnerrElsl2lc8ysU_AGnyjZa2EDEMif4_3xDpqGG5hcukyRF5qfsYBYji6IbMNw)) can fit into a strength training program, beside resistance training and plyometrics.",1629293490

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Are my Hoka's &amp; orthotics causing my injury? Random foot problems flairing up....,"In February 2021 during the end of the run, I had shooting left heel pain out of nowhere. I tried running the next day and was in absolute agony. I couldn't even walk back because it hurt to push off my foot. However, it almost didn't hurt at all when I wore flip-flops, only closed backed shoes. I never got an official diagnosis, but I suspected insertional achilles tendonitis or bursitis. I also nordic skied and was running 10ks and halfs before all this, so my coach suspected switching from the rigid ski boot to my running shoe caused the injury.   


I took 3-4 weeks off (still biked) and the pain was sort of gone. It still hurt a bit to wear a running shoe backing. I tried on a pair of Hoka One One's with orthotics and I was shocked. I ran pain free! Sometimes I could still ""feel"" it but there was no pain. I had one of my best track seasons and ended up PRing in meets. I'll say that my Hoka's saved my track season lol.  


Around June I started noticing my left heel/achilles becoming stiff (this time higher up) and I chalked that up to not stretching as much. I switched to a new pair of Hoka's and kept the orthotics and then started noticing my RIGHT heel felt a little stiff (crap). It even began to pop during runs and when I pressed down on the tendon, I felt a bit of pain. Seemed like classic achilles tendonitis, just my luck. This time in my ""good heel."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Every run since July something hurts in my feet (though nowhere's near the pain I experienced in February). The bottom of my right foot, my left calf, the top of my right foot, my left heel, my right inner ankle (I hope to God it's not posterior tibial tendonitis - it started a couple days ago). It's not in my head, but I know in the past I ran through little twinges here and there, but these feel a bit more significant, though I could be wrong. When one foot hurts somewhere the other doesn't and vice versa. There is no ""good foot"" anymore lol.  


Luckily these ""injuries"" haven't caused me to stop running though I've debating taking time off and had to ice frequently. It doesn't help that I worked a lot as a cashier on my feet standing in one spot all day. I've been an absolute pain to deal with according to my family, even though I've tried not to dwell on injuries and jump to worst case scenario. But it's frustrating. I'm not 100% pain free and I'm not sure if I ever will be. It sucks. I know I could just take time off but my season starts in 2 days and it's not like taking time off for a couple weeks will even resolve things. It's likely like I'll need more long term time off and then start all over again. Sigh.  


I've been lucky to be injury free so far. I did once run through a week of plantar fasciitis, and a month of weird foot stuff last summer. Both went away and never came back. Up until my injuries I was running in Brooks and loved them. I don't really think they contributed to my injury. Some people pointed me towards a more stabilizing shoe, but I usually had neutral. For three years I once noticed every time I bent down to tie my shoe, the bone (my tibia?) slightly above my inner left ankle hurt (but it NEVER hurt to run and nothing ever happened - it's gone now). Now my inner tendon bone above my ankle hurts on right side, too..  


But the other day I tried running in a Brooks pair (stabilizing) to transition out of Hoka's and the outside of my right ankle by the tendon hurt, so back to adding in orthotics and eventually just switching to Hoka's again it was. Any recommendations on how to proceed? I feel hopeless and luckily I will have a trainer to talk with. I don't want to do longterm damage, but since running doesn't seem to be worsening it (?) is there any way I can attempt to get rid of it? Sorry for long post.",1629240286

AdvancedRunning,Ethnadar,summer improvements + goal reevaluation,"At the beginning of summer I got tested at a sports clinic, and my stats were average at best. My VO2 Max was &lt;50 and my lactate threshold pace was 7:30. 

I’ve always been a “work as hard as I can at every moment” person, so I was reluctant to hear that in order to improve my 5k the most, I needed longer and slower runs. Most days I wouldn’t even be under 8 min/mile. Don’t get me wrong, some days I would do some faster work (2x2 mile at 6:30 pace with 90s break).

Anyway today was my 2nd test, and here are the results:

VO2 Max - ~62.3
Lactate threshold pace - 5:40

I know that my numbers aren’t INSANE, but I would still like to say that I’m proud of myself for coming this far, getting faster, and most importantly, being a LOT better at injury prevention. 

 Since the first test, I’m about halfway along the timeline until my state cross country meet, and my goal is to win. Currently in my district and state (Iowa 2a), anyone under 16:30 is a contender for winning, so low 16s is my goal. 

I’ve had the confidence all summer, but now I feel I also have genuine potential. 

This is my 2nd post in this sub, the first is me explaining my goals (albeit in a much more desperate manner) and every reply I got was extremely helpful, I’ve been injury free since that post and I would just like to thank everyone who suggested ideas, I now know the importance of stretching and recovery. 

I’m using these posts mostly as journal for myself to explain where I am and how others at the elite level react to how my training is going, so if there is anything for you to add that to think could benefit me, please, speak up!

TL;DR : I’ve improved a lot, thanks for the help from everyone who did.",1629237969
AdvancedRunning,hayfeverrun,Chasing injuries around the same foot for almost a year,"Curious if anyone has had experience with and/or links to good resources to understand cause-and-effects behind different foot injuries I've been chasing over the last 9 months.

First, I thought I had plantar fasciitis (I probably did, as my foot cramped in the plantar fasciitis area in a run, and I had been exhibiting the classic signs of waking steps in pain, albeit more like 1-2/10 versus stabbing pain) 

So, I largely ignored it but switched to cross-training and lower volume. Eventually, I was told by a doc I probably have insertional Achilles (about 3 months ago)

More recently, after a silly day of spiking my volume, I developed a case of peroneal tendonitis. It was self-diagnosed, but the signs were clear and far more disruptive than the earlier 2. Unlike the earlier 2, where my foot was probably exhibiting warning signs but wasn't actually causing any problems, this one did not allow me to even walk for a few weeks (and I'm still rebuilding).

More importantly, these have all been on the same foot (right).

**Questions**

1. Do these seem related? If so, is there something I'm doing that's leading to these? Any targeted remedies? (have tried the ""basics"" like foam rolling, stretching, particularly around the calf muscles, but haven't really found any systematic tight spots)
2. Would love a sense check on my doc's usual advice (who is a runner as well) - which is usually to rest, ramp slowly, and don't worry too much about 1-2/10 pain unless its getting worse",1629231954

Not running due to reasons I cannot discuss. If I was I would be replenishing those cals at least. 

Anyway, do you think 6 weeks is enough time to completely wreck my bone density? In my case I'm doing this diet as a trade off because on one hand being 190 lbs is a risk by itself and of course I may have weaker bones but at a lighter weight when I'm done (160lbs).

So I feel like it's worth the trade off but does anyone know how quickly bones can bounce back? I'm in my 20's by the way, supposedly the prime of your health.

AdvancedRunning,Dat__,How to adjust marathon expectations based on first HM time trial?,"Yesterday was the midpoint of my Marathon training which was my first half marathon time trial which I ran in yesterday in 1:44. I initially set a goal of sub-4 which looks like is already doable based on this result. I’m 26M 5’11” 160lbs training for my first marathon in October, following the Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 plan with a few more miles per week and 40miles cycling per week for cross-training. No injury/pain concerns at all yet. Before starting the plan I did 3 weeks of 20 miles per week to get a feel for the mileage, as I’ve only been doing casual ~5-10 weeks before that for about a year. Looking back I should have built more of a real base before starting, but that’s besides the point.

Now it’s looking like I may be able to strive for a bit better time than just sub-4. Considering that I did &gt;85% of my training in brutally hot/humid summer temps, and that I have 9 more weeks in the plan (which is backloaded with higher mileage) leading to a cool fall race in October, how should I *generally* update my pace expectations for the marathon accordingly, and/or how should I analyze my HM results to make the most impactful improvements in training going forward?

[Here are my splits for the run, along with HR data for the same splits](https://imgur.com/a/Atnx4oG). I felt it went better than expected and didn’t have any huge struggles during the race. Miles 4-10 felt just about ‘perfect’ IMO but the HR readings had me hold off a bit more than I would’ve liked. Any tips at all would be greatly appreciated!

12 hour trail race coming up in southern Louisiana in two weeks which marks today as my first day of taper. It will be a very hot day (as they all are) on a technical trail. 

From my reading, adaptation to the heat happens “relatively” quickly over the course of a few weeks and since it’s the most difficult race specific hurdle that I will face, would it be wise to do the taper runs outside in the heat to keep/gain my heat tolerance or would it be better to use the taper to fully recover by staying indoors and avoiding the heat?",1629126514
AdvancedRunning,DickensofDetroit,Base Building post-HM,"29M, began running in late Nov. 2020.

Started with Active’s Couch to 5k program, the 5k to 10K program after that, then signed up and trained for a HM. Just ran my first half in 1:50:19. For the half training, I didn’t follow a super-specific plan. Peak mileage week was 28 mi, but overall average mpw throughout the plan was in the low 20s.

I’d like to build my base up to 50 mpw over the next several months and have identified the Pfitz 45 mpw base-building plan as a place to start. That plan starts at 27 miles - is that too high based on the average mpw in my half training? Should I do a few weeks of lower mileage before jumping into the base building plan?

Over the last year and a half or so, I've had numerous mileage ramp ups in an attempt to improve and get back to my HS level of fitness (See my flair for my HS times).  I always seem to get my mileage up to around 25-30 mpw, and then my shins start to break down.  Every time.

People always mention shoes when talking about shins, so I'll say I have a high arch and I alternate between 2 pairs of Hoka Clifton 8's.
 
About 6 months ago I decided I was sick of the injuries and felt I was always doing things a bit too aggressively, so I was going to ramp up so slowly that it was physically impossible to get hurt when I got to the dreaded 30 mpw.  I started with 3 runs of 3 miles per week and did that for a month straight, and then ramped up over 6 months from there.  I was adding, on average, 1 mile per week to my weekly volums.  Every other week, I do a long run, and on the ""off week"" I do a longer-but-not-super-long run.

Currently I'm at this point:

&gt;Long week:  6, 3, 4, rest, 10, 4, rest

&gt;Off week: 6, 3, 4, rest, 7, 4, rest

Again, this was built up to slowly over the course of 6 months, and I've held my mileage for a month at the above schedule.  Sure enough, after 1 month of training at this mileage, my shins started to break down and started hurting.  I'm simply baffled at this point.  Not only have I been well UNDER the 10% rule, I'm also taking a week completely off every 5-6 weeks to fully recover.  This isn't even high mileage, this was a recovery week for me in high school. 

I also walk a mile or two every day in minimalist shoes around my neighborhood, sometimes even walking in just my socks.

I'm looking for advice on how to proceed from here.  I honestly have no idea what else I can do.  I eat healthy, I get lots of sleep, I have a midfoot stripe and I maintain right around 180 steps per minute.  Am I just screwed to never be able to get in any sort of good shape because I can't up my mileage?",1629090847

Also, I try to eat something light (think couple pieces of toast / smoothie, etc) before I head out.

So I've kind of been looking at this thread for a while and I'm so jealous of everyone here. I see so many people being able to run amazing distance with times and stuff and I desperately want to do that but I can't. I know that this is a thread for super advanced runners but your help would be greatly appreciated  So basically I started running March of last year. I was 140 lbs and I just wanted to incorporate healthier habits into my life like eating healthy and giving my body much needed activity. I wasn't doing C25k; I was just running at whatever speed outside. Fast forward to November/ December 2020, I became really insecure with my body and started calorie counting up until March 2021. I was eating 1600-1700 calories a day while running 4 miles three to four times a week and also doing like an hour of weight training and dropped down to 116-117 pounds. I was sick of counting calories so I stopped before my lacrosse season. Fast forward to now, I can only run 2-3 miles (even sometimes, my runs don't even feel good like my legs get sluggish and I feel tired). I run at a relatively okay pace. Right now my time for a 5k is 27:13, my 2 mile is 17:21, and my 1.5 mile is 11:42. But I cannot run more than that or else my legs start feel tight and I get side stitches or my body makes some other excuse to stop running. I am in good shape, on the skinny side with a two-pack, some arm and leg definition, but my athletic performance is struggling. I also haven't been seeing any progress in my arms when lifting weights like I'm getting slightly stronger but my arms still look the same. My legs usually feel super tight after a gym session and I'm slowly losing my passion for running when I really do love it. I just want to be able run more and I feel like something in my body is just not agreeing with it. Now I only run 2-3 times a week which I don't know how to feel about (my dad was a competitive runner and says that running a lot at a young age will have an effect on your knees so that's one thing).I feel as if I eat enough a day, but sometimes I find myself limiting myself or choosing the lower calorie option, but I don't track but know I'm eating around 90-100g of protein a day.

a) Keep going with the 18/55 plan I'm on right now, and just ride the fitness gains I'm inevitably going to get from that;

b) Shift to a dedicated 12 week HM plan (would also love to get perspectives on whose plan you'd recommend);

AdvancedRunning,TheAnonymousUsername,"Is the often debated “anabolic window” relevant to runners? And if so, does cooling down chew into it?","For anyone unaware, my (relatively simple/uninformed) knowledge is that the anabolic window refers to the 30-60 minutes post exercise when the body is most primed to build muscle, making it an ideal time to consume protein and carbs. And after that timeframe/window, the body is much less primed to build muscle (basically you get less bang for your buck as far as muscle growth if you have protein 2 hours post workout instead of 30 minutes after).

I know cardio is a catabolic activity, but my (again, somewhat uninformed) understanding is that post exercise the body is in an anabolic state.

My question, in regards to running, is what if you’re doing some type of marathon session that has a super long cool down (like 6-10 miles) where you’re running a hard session in the first quarter or half of the run, and then running the second half of your run easy on worn out legs.

Does the anabolic window start once you finish your hard effort/session or does it start once you finish your run, even if the last 40 minutes was easy jogging?

Say you run 2 miles warm up then 10 by K with 2’ jog between and then 10 miles easy/cooldown, if possible should you consume protein after your final K or after you finish your whole run?",1628982727

AdvancedRunning,MrDrProfBrad,"Long-term, probably self-induced changes to appetite during long runs","General background: I (26/m) have one marathon under my belt that I did in April and am planning to run another one late this fall. Before training for my first marathon I had a solid 20 mpw base and peaked mid 30s. Now, I have a solid mid 30s mpw base before starting training for my 2nd marathon. 

Long run nutrition background: While training for my first marathon I only ate protein bars during long runs (12-20 miles) until the last couple weeks when I started trying beef jerky too. Once I started doing long runs again after the marathon I mostly ate beef jerky and dropped the protein bars, not because I couldn't tolerate them but just because I liked the beef jerky. A couple weeks after I started adding dried fruit to my long run diet, again just because it tasted good. Fast forward 2-3 months and now after not eating protein bars during long runs for all this time it feels like they are the last thing I'd want to put in my stomach during a long run. I carried one with me during my 12 mile run today but I wanted nothing to do with it even as I became hungry in the last few miles. 

ALSO - my general diet has stayed the same throughout all of this. Although now I only eat 3-4 large meals per day where before I snacked throughout the day.

Question: have I unintentionally manipulated my long run appetite? Could I go back to protein bars (not that I really need to) if I forced myself? Could I get myself used to eating absolutely anything during long runs so long as it gives me good nutrients/fuel? Has anyone else experienced something like this?",1628974606

## Training

I haven't had a ""training plan"" per se since getting back into running literally the day that COVID shut down in-person classrooms at the preschool I was teaching at in March of 2020. Prior to that I'd done a few 10K, 15K type ""fun run"" events every few years, but no serious running with regular 40+ mpw months since two years as a college track team walk-on in 2007 and 2008.

I got up to a regular \~70 mpw for most of the spring of 2021 with two pretty successful trail ultramarathons -- a 3:59 finish marred by a course navigation DQ, and a slower but first overall finish on one out in Long Island. I nabbed a HM PR in a solo effort at 1:27 in there, too, and threw in a couple solo marathon-length FKTs for good effort.

I picked up a little IT band niggle in early June, though, ending a \~120 day running streak and putting me onto the Peloton to spin for a bit. That, strength work and some easy reintroduction of jogging got me back into running \~20mpw in about a week... just in time for my wife and I to pack up everything we owned and move from New York to Oregon via a U-Haul truck.

July was pretty sloppy, some base miles at a slower pace than prior to my IT niggle, a tiny bit of speed work, gradually working up from June's 20mpw back to 50. I finally felt ""back"" with a solid 14 mile long run at a respectable 7:30 pace two weeks ago, leaving me reasonably confident for the local running club's 30K.

## Pre-race

Nothing too special. I did find a hell of a price on Vaporfly 4% Flyknits at a Nike Outlet, and took them for a one-mile shakeout on Friday. Based mostly on that 14'er from late July, I figured I could reasonably hit \~7:10 pace for the race and a \~2:10 finishing time, maybe closer to 7-flat with good company and conditions. I passed on my evening bourbon for a couple days prior to race day, got a reasonable amount of sleep, picked out my favorite 2"" purple shorts, and was good to go on Saturday morning.

The race has both solo runners and teams for a 3x10K relay. At the start I recognized one sponsored-by-Brooks local hero who I figured would crush the solo (which he did), then was left to roughly guess who else I might see in the \~2:10 range based on... IDK, body composition and running gear. It's even trickier than usual because I see one kid who looks like a solid local XC/TF high schooler... on the same relay team as his 50 year old dad-bod dad. Whatever, time to run.

## Race

Sure enough, Brooks guy takes off at the gun, followed by a different teenager relay kid who I assume is badly overdoing it (based mostly on his cotton tee). I'm third behind them, with one or two dudes not too far behind when I glance over my shoulder. Our area of the Oregon Coast has an omnipresent wind out of the north for most of the year -- it's milder today, but still at our backs for the first two or three miles that roll downhill. Mile one... 6:40? Hmm. Effort feels reasonable and maintainable, I'm sure it'll even out. Followed by 6:37... good still...

Middle of the third mile, the Brooks guy is already out of sight off the front. The cotton tee relay high schooler is within 50 feet and looking miserable. There's Jason right behind me, then apparently nothing within sight behind him. OK, so it's time to hold with Jason or face what'll probably be 16 solo miles if I let him get ahead.

Sure enough, cotton tee fades out behind us. Mile three with Jason comes by at 6:21 -- uh oh -- but he doesn't hold that for too long after the split and we settle back into 6:40's as the 10K mark comes up.

The course turns up into the (still mild) wind and onto some rolling hills around this point. Three or four times I find myself putting 30 or 60 meters on Jason on a shortish climb, only for him to make it back up on the descent and flats. I've got no particular interest in trying to drop him; we're still in the 6:50's on the rolling sections, way ahead of my goals, and still feeling sustainable. 20K in \~1:23. Around here I ask him what he was trying to finish in; he's definitely looking fresher than me, but I don't know if he misheard me or what because we go into a short chat about hometowns. Whatever.

The race was advertised for relay teams as saving the third 10K for the ""hills lover"", but it's really pretty mild. On one of Jason's turns to lead the way for a still-flattish section near mile 14 he kicks into 6:15 pace and I get worried but decide to stick on his shoulder --  whatever the reason was, it doesn't last for more than a half mile or so, and we're back to comfy in the 6:40's range.

Mile 16 has a net gain of \~150 feet with a little rolling; I split a 7:30 and build my biggest lead of the day over Jason for second overall, but don't really have it in me to start a kick for the last 2.5 and sure enough he's right on my shoulder.

There's one last notable bump as we take a bridge back into town -- and for this climb, he's right on my shoulder. The bridge and its narrow sidewalk ends, and Jason takes off right before the turn into the finish area. I split 6:15 pace for my last 1K but Jason gets me for second place by probably 20 seconds as I finish in 2:05:41. Brooks guy first overall by a solid 20 minutes, of course.

## Post-race

The usual postrace BBQ, water, beer and such. I meet a local Olympic Qualifiers-level race-walker who was first overall in the women's 30K with a comfortable-for-her jogging cruise, pet some dogs, and head home to write up this pile of words.

I'd be lying if I didn't think about stretching my 6:45 pace over a full marathon and BQ'ing. No real idea if I want to fly cross-country for a race in 2022 -- leaning ""no"", but it's bouncing around my brain at least. I've actually never run a sanctioned marathon, so at least training to get a sub-3 somewhere local would be a nice goal. And maybe following a more structured training plan to get there...

**Background —** I’m a 39 M with roughly 40-50 mpw. I’ve run 3 marathons (5:05, 4:55, 4:45) and 1, 50k (6:30). My fave runs are long (typically in the 16-22 mile range). I've been doing this for about 4 years, the last \~6 months following this x5 day schedule: 

* 2 easy, 4-8 miles (10-10:30 ish)
* 1 long, 13-22 miles (same pace)
* 2 hard, 3mi WU/CD + 3-4 mi tempo (9-ish) or interval, like 3x4 min with 5min recovery (9-ish)

I also use HRR to ensure I’m staying in the right zone on easy and long runs, which is both comforting and anxiety-inducing.  

**Goal —** As you can see I’m not very fast. But I’d like to change that, while keeping my current fitness at being able to run far (tho slowly). My dream is to run a sub 2 hr half, and/or sub 1 hr 10k. I recognize this is a big jump in pace (10:30 to more like 8:45!), but in the end I'd love to be able to run far, just more quickly. t

**Problem —** However, the plans I’m seeing are focused on folks who have never run before with low weekly mileage (20 miles) or the long runs top out at, like 10 miles. :( 

So my question to y'all: is it even possible to work towards this goal? Or do I need to abandon my fitness on long runs? 

Thanks in advance!",1628917372
AdvancedRunning,teamobliterator,Training for a sprint triathlon and half marathon,"I’m a 5’8” male and weigh 160 pounds. The sprint is in 6 weeks and the half is in 11 weeks. I have quite a bit of muscle as I have more of a bodybuilding background and am now getting into running/racing. I consider myself lean as I have visible abs, but I’m not shredded. 

What is an ideal racing weight for a 5’8 male? Im considering aiming for ~1 pound of weight loss a week to get to 150. I fear that might be too low, but it doesn’t appear to be when I see other people’s weights at my height. My thing is I often become food obsessed and can feel lightheaded throughout the day due to my deficit. I average about 2000-2200 calories a day. 

I lift 6-7 days a week, PPL. Minimum miles running is 4, and I’m going to be slowly increasing that overtime. I’ll be cycling and swimming on my days I don’t work. I’ll be really active, and would much prefer to feel good rather than so “off” while running a deep deficit. 

I don’t want to do this wrong, and it seems like I should be eating more, but I don’t know if I should just deal with it and push through. This is part of a verbal process, but I’m also looking for help and insight since like I said I am new to racing and training more like an athlete. I only lifted before.

AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Running and Weight,"Hey all, some of you might remember my post [earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/kuvtnb/does_anyone_else_just_hate_dealing_with_weight/) lamenting the interplay between running and weightloss. Its been a while, and I wanted to share an update on my situation and some thoughts on the process. 

Since that post I've lost about 12 pounds, and I'm currently hanging out around 150. For a 5'8/5'9 guy I could probably cut a bit more, but I'm pretty well built and I think this is as far as I want to go from a health perspective. My big breakthrough was just learning to fall asleep without worrying about how much I had eaten that day. I don't have any big tips or tricks here, for a long time sleeping with a deficit was a problem and then it wasn't. I was able to get more stringent about IF and the deficits followed naturally. 

The cut generally was not linear, I'd drop a few pounds, plateau, then drop several more. I did not count calories and continued to run around 50 mpw. I'm not sure if my workouts were impacted, but as I got below 155 I did notice a bit more lethargy and maybe reduced recovery. Its hard to know, because this corresponded with some pretty solid training and the Summer heat. I absolutely had some shitty workouts in there but also some super solid ones. 

If you're looking for motivation, I've absolutely set PRs and I can see my easier paces dropping pretty precipitously, about 30 sec min/mile faster even with the heat. Some of this is going to be down to an explosion of aerobic fitness that I think has come from a year of solid base building, but def some of it is the cut weight too. 

I would say though this is not a process that's intrinsically safe or healthy. I definitely think more about how/when I eat and have developed a propensity to undereat a bit. Weight loss trains you to habitually eat at a deficit, and its a pattern you need to be prepared to arrest when you start to get close to your goal weight. I can absolutely see how someone would blow past their initial goal target and get into dangerous territory. Looking better and running faster are great but its super easy to conflate both of those with weight loss, which is not sustainable at all. 

All and all I have mixed feelings on this. Running faster is great, but I do think losing weight as an athlete is a bit more dangerous than folks give credence too. Most people at least know about the physical risk, but I think there are very real mental health issues that can develop as a result of an extended cut like this and if you're considering it I'd advise you to be very honest with yourself about motivations, goals, and habits. I've seen multiple athletes succumb to REDs over time and its not pretty, most of them haven't really recovered

For those of you who've cut a bunch of weight, how has keeping it off gone? I'm down about 20 pounds in the last two years, and going from 170-&gt;160 seemed super sustainable. Should I expect the same here? Do you still watch your diet? I think one of the hardest parts so far has been arresting the cut back to a sustainable level of eating, hard to change ingrained habits like that. Any tips?",1628880177

AdvancedRunning,koteko_,Did a LT test in the lab,"I've long been interested in the physiology of running and how it applies to training, and the road to understanding is still long. But the relationship between lactate and HR has always been a curiosity of mine, and I finally got a proper test done instead of endless approximations.

# Premise

\- I have Forerunner 945 that I've set to use with Heart Rate Reserve zones, having an actual maxHR and everyday recalculating the zones based on resting HR (depending on fitness and circumstances, it can be 55 to 70; but it's usually just around 60).

\- From 5K, 8K and 10K races/TTs, I had already guesstimated my LTHR at 179-180bpm but didn't have the confidence to build my zones over this before testing it in the lab

\- I don't have an HR strap so I've never tried Garmin's LT test. I've done time trials but I can't, say, run 30 minutes at a consistent pace. Any race or time trial I attempt, will be a bit chaotic in pace - I start fast, then succumb a bit, then surge back in the last Ks/laps. So Joe Friel's tests were also out. However, see above.. 8K and 10K races for slower runners, can help pinpoint the LT. For faster runners, 15K and HMs will be overall better indicators.

# How it's done

The test, for those that don't know, is performed like this (there are probably variations):

\- you get on a treadmill (with an HR strap) and run at a baseline for 5 minutes (7 km/h)

\- you stop and a doctor takes some blood from your earlobe (totally painless)

\- you start again, at 9 km/h for about 3 minutes, and get another sample

\- same process for 11, 13 and 15 km/h

At this point they have 5 HR values, and 5 lactate concentration values. They fit a line over the HR points, and an exponential curve over the lactate points, and then interpolate the corresponding HR values at 2 mmol/L (aerobic threshold or AeT or lactate inflection point, when lactate is about double than the basal concentration but it still doesn't accumulate if you keep intensity fixed) and 4 mmol/L (anaerobic threshold or AnT or lactate turnover point, above which lactate will keep increasing even if you stop increasing speed).

# Results

In this way they get **HR @ AeT** as well as **HR @ AnT.** I got **159** and **179** respectively. Now, these are the zones I currently have configured on my Garmin, they are classic Karvonen zones applied to HRR:

&amp;#x200B;

|Max HR: 196|Resting HR: 60||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Z1|128|140.6|
|Z2|141.6|154.2|
|Z3|155.2|167.8|
|Z4|168.8|181.4|
|Z5|182.4|196|

The end of Z4 is pretty close to AnT, and the end of Z2 is pretty close to the AeT. So I've been training ""correctly"".

Other interesting tidbits:

\- my optical wrist HR was more stable in the last, 15 km/h step of the test, than the provided HR strap. For the lower zones, they were in sync. This means I can trust my 945 a lot (which I already suspected).

\- Garmin's LTHR Zones, if I plug 179, show 159 as the upper end of Zone 2 (which is usually where one expects the AeT). I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or if they actually chose some very good zone bounds. Comparatively, 80/20 calculator gives me 161 as Z2's upperbound.

\- the test costed like a new pair of running shoes, but the ""retest"" after 1 or 1.5 months is free. I'm **very** curious to know if after intense training, the HR at AeT and AnT will change, or only the pace. And how will this related to resting HR and the corresponding zones? We'll see :)

\- I don't think I'll set my zones to LTHR for now, until I'm sure about how it changes over time. With HRR, I **see** resting HR going down over time, as training intensifies, and I change my zones accordingly. With LTHR, I still have no clue about the dynamics over weeks and months and training.",1628869418
AdvancedRunning,yerbertMYfeartsRt8sy,"Question about HR, perceived effort, and hill training","Background: 31F.  I've been running since high school, but have had to take time off here and there due to endometriosis, surgeries, really bad IBS, and other random life things.  I used to be moderately fast (1600m|5:45, 3200m|12:08, 5k|20:20, HM|1:45:00ish), but those times have gone up significantly since my glory days.  My goal now is 1:40:00 HM before I hit 40-- I call it ""40 by 40""-- and it's very long-term because I expect chronic illness / life to get in the way periodically.  Some recent times were roughly 4k|20:00, 10k|55:00, HM|1:52:00.

I've been running consistently for over a year now and I'm currently at 40k a week over 4 days, plus 2 strength/easy cardio days, and 1 day walking/hiking.  I increase mileage by 25-30% each month, hold it for a month, drop 10-15% for a week, and then bump up again.  (I'm loosely following Jack Daniels, and everything is religiously mapped out in spreadsheets, down to what percentage of weekly mileage is spent on tempos, intervals, long runs, etc.)

I live in a ""hilly"" place near the Alps, so most races on my radar the next few months have some up and down.  This past week I ran a hill work-out on a 9%-grade, 300m-long hill.  I warmed up 2k, ran 10 reps with zigzaging jogs back downhill, and cooled down 2k.  It was warmer than usual and muggy in the woods, and it felt absolutely brutal.  Miraculously, I wasn't sore the next day (thanks, I think, to lots of strength-training and hiking), but my body felt heavy.  I had trouble sleeping the night after the workout and the following day, but it may also have been heat-related.  (Top floor with no AC, yayyyy.)

My Fitbit isn't 100% accurate at higher heart rates, but my perceived effort was 9/10.  My resting HR is 57, and I think my max HR is about 190, so 90-95% effort puts me at 177-183.  My Fitbit recorded consistent peaks of 179 during each effort and valleys at 130 in between.

Should I have allowed my HR to drop so much between efforts?  Was I potentially pushing my heart too hard during efforts?  I have some innate anxiety about tough work-outs-- like a fear that I won't be able to catch my breath-- and sometimes it's hard to tell if the heart-pounding breathlessness is panic, or what I should be feeling.  I think my HR dropped so much between efforts because I would need a few seconds to psych myself up before the next round.

I'm planning to repeat the workout once a month before my main race in November.  I also alternate intensities each week, e.g., next week my interval work-out will aim for 85-90%.",1628848555

AdvancedRunning,IR995,My view on Aerobic development,"I'm halfway in a 16 week training block leading to my first 100k mountain race.
It's going to be my first 100k, and because of how hard the course is, focusing 99% on easy/steady longer workouts seemed like the way to go as I sat down tailoring my plan.
I don't like to follow generalized training plas, because I have found success with how I write down my own plan, based on the pros taken from authors and coaches like Daniel, Lydiard, Magnes, Roche and the list goes on.
I mostly race in the mountains and on pretty hilly terrain, but what I found interesting is that I do NOT see the progress I was expecting to see when I started the plan.
Why do I think so? Well mostly because of the plan and outcome of a previous mountain marathon with a lot of D+. 
Back then, due to the winter snow in the mountains, training on specific terrain was limited, so I was kind of forced to train on flat roads despite racing in the mountains. Of course, it's not like I didn't go out on the trails, but I'd say 6 of my 10 weekly runs were on flat roads, sometimes even more, and the obes I did on trails were with much less elevation gain than my race.
For this race I decided to try and train Every. Single. Time. on terrain simmilar to my upcoming race.
BUT! Keeping the effort/Heart rate (measured with a chest strap) on trails is far more difficult than on a flat terrain. For example: I could go out for a 1hr tempo effort run, right? On an out-and-back course I could do an uphill-only run at tempo effort, but then when I needed to come down from the hills I simply could not keep the same effort because if I could do that, I think there's a fair chance I'd end up with injuries. 
My point is that I think it's more important to log in more TIME at a specific effort od HR, rather than just distance.
Now why is that? Uphill running is more demanding than running on flat terrain. Why don't I see the same and Better progress then?
Well in my opinion it's because of how much time one is actually able to stay at an effort, when training something specific, rather to just add miles of which half (for me at least) would be at HR/effort so low that I would never EVER have when running on flat roads.
What's your take on this? I'd like this to become a more in depth conversation in the comments, and not just a long post like this.",1628801479

AdvancedRunning,flipswhitfudge,Need help designing the endurance discipline for my team track and field project.,"I'm designing a more team-oriented format for track and field, with the goal of increasing participation in the sport and making things more interesting for the casual viewer. There are 6 disciplines, one for each major event group; sprint, vertical jump, horizontal jump, throw, hurdle, and endurance. 

I'm making a ""sportshall"" and an outdoor version of this team format. The sportshall version is to increase accessibility (not every school has a track), but the outside version is supposed to be the standard.

For the sportshall endurance discipline, I based it on the Yoyo pacer test [Yo-yo IR1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo_intermittent_test)
because it combines elements of endurance and popular team sports like basketball and soccer, improving the likelihood of recruiting athletes from multiple backgrounds. In this discipline, each team fields 6 runners who all undergo the yoyo test at the same time. When a runner reaches their limit, their distance is recorded and converted to points (every discipline is calibrated so 150 points is a good high school level performance in each discipline). Each 100m is worth 1 point. I'm satisfied with this design for the limited space of a sportshall, but I want to do something more track-based for outdoors.

So far the idea is to basically do competitive interval training. So there would be a target time and all athletes in the field would try to complete a lap inside the target time. After a short rest they would go again, and this repeats until none of the athletes are able to complete the run inside the target time anymore. Every lap completed by a runner contributes points to their team total. There would be pack tactics as runners try to take the inside lane and waste the other team's energy. 

The problem is I'm not from a distance running background so I'm not sure what the target time should be, how long the rest should be, or if any distance runners would actually enjoy this. There are also time constraints, as the plan is to have each event go one by one and have the whole thing last 2-3 hours.

And I have tried using GLONASS and GPS, GPS only, GLONASS only, factory resetting letting it be synced to satellite for 5+ minutes, and many other (combinations of) things as well

So I have a Garmin fenix 5s. I absolutely love it. About a year ago I was unable to use it (or even have it charged) for about 2.5 months. I do not know if it was the time unused/charged or the fact I had it for ~2 years. 

Before that time the watch was absolutely amazing with keeping distance! After getting it back working it would be at a minimum 10% wrong on nearly every run. One day on the way out it would be accurate, on the way back it would be way off. The next day the watch would say I ran .3 miles when I ran 1, then be accurate the rest of the way. The following day it would be wrong in another way. It would be wrong in different ways all the time.",1628730493

I am currently going into my first year of high school. I have been running for about 4 years at this point and I would like to call myself a semi experienced runner. So anyways, I've been training constantly this summer and I made it up to around 40 miles a week at the end of July. The thing is, my vacation weeks are both in august and right before cross country starts. I just got back from my first trip (up in Colorado) and I wasn't able to do much running due to the really high altitude (9000+ feet) and I got pretty bad headaches whenever I tried to run. I usually only made it 1-3 miles at about 30-70 seconds slower than usual easy pace.

So I am basically one week untrained and in three days I will be leaving for another week and I will not have the ability to train. When I get back I have one day until XC starts. What I am asking is: how much fitness will I lose? and how quickly can I gain it back if I lose it?

I want to be in great shape when the XC season starts because there are tryouts and the meets start within a week or two.

I was running around 50-60 mpw when training. It was during a Boston training block. I have a half coming up In a month and want to repeat that time. I started in January, but have been averaging 40 mpw since then, with a few 50s. If training goes according to plan I’ll be hitting 60s for the next 4 weeks, no taper for the race, cause I’m in another marathon block. The race is exactly 1 month out and I’m curious if anyone thinks it’s reasonable for me to run that same pace (5:53) again for the half I have coming up. I’ve been completing all the workouts. Had one week with a hamstring issue, but it’s been resolved mostly.

Are there any key workouts that would indicate anything or can I rely on some muscle memory to help me out?

Workout Examples I’ve done recently 

I did an 8 m temp at 6:12, and it didn’t feel terribly difficult. It was supposed to be a MP workout. 

Also I did a 4x400, 10 min tempo, 4x400, 10 min tempo, 4x400. 400s we’re around 1:17 avg. Tempo was around 5:58-6:00. Again not terribly difficult.

Lastly 12x1k @3:30-3:25 with 1 min rest between reps and 3 min between sets. 

I have a workout today that is as prescribed…

Run 15 minutes @HMP (3 min standing recovery)
Run 10 minutes @HMP (3 min standing recovery)
2-4 sets of 5 min @10k (3 min standing recovery between each)

&gt; (1) The biggest benefit of heat acclimation may be plasma volume expansion. Just as altitude stimulates your body to produce more red blood cells, heat stress stimulates your body to produce more plasma. The result is a greater cardiac output, and higher VO2 at a given effort level. In the New Zealand study, resting plasma volume increased by 4.5%, even though the the athletes had very high plasma volume to start; in the Oregon study, plasma volume increased by 6.5%.

I recently read the book ""Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"" and the major thesis of the book is that inhaling through your nose is better, though the author is talking about day-to-day life, not running in particular. 

I also heard about Wim Hoff though that book, and found this [interesting breathing exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) on youtube. 

Watching the Olympics, it got me thinking about how athletes seek to maximize and hone every aspect of their body and technique, and so I wonder if elite runners do anything different breathing-wise...

AdvancedRunning,Lou_Garet,Need advice on getting sick in prime training weeks,"Sitting here writing this after what was supposed to be my last long run I’m my marathon training block, 3 weeks out from race day. I had 23-24 @ 7:15ish/mile on the schedule and was hoping to be feeling strong and confident. In reality, I just barely squeaked out 14.4 @ 8:10 and was absolutely falling apart at the end, going well over 9:00/mi for the final couple. 

Last week I came down sick with what I think was a bad cold (got the Covid test and it came back negative). Symptoms just seemed to linger all week but I managed a 6 and an 8 miler towards the end of the week. Today I was hoping to at least get 15 in and get back to feeling relatively normal again. From the start I was fighting it to try to hold decent form and keep the heart rate down. Just still felt off but was hoping my body would get loosened up  and start rolling along easy. 5-6 in I felt ok and held around 7:30 pace but it fell off from there. Slowly bleeding pace until the wheels fell off around 12-13. Jogged it home feeling completely discouraged. Goal time for race day was 2:55. Right now I’m seriously debating calling it off completely. 

So the decision now is where do I go from here. Do I keep grinding it out? Do I just take rest days until I’m back at 100%? Adjust the goal for the race? Any advice appreciated",1628353709
AdvancedRunning,robert_parkr,Running plan for 3 days a week,"Hi, 

I am 48 y/o and started running in September 2020. In November 2020 I got a degenerative median meniscus tear. My physiotherapist advised me to only run three times a week for the longevity of my knee.

How much I can maximum run each day if I run only 3 times a week without increasing my risk for injury? 

I wanted to do the red plan of Jack Daniels but that has 4 times a week running as a minimum.
So I am thinking of a week A and week B. 
Week A: two easy runs of 1 hour and one long run of 2 hours. 
Week B: two runs with a mix of easy runs and threshold/interval runs and one long run of 2 hours. 

Does that make any sense?

My goals are to increase my fitness and to stay healthy and fit while I get older. 

I train also 3 times a week with kettlebells.",1628349312
AdvancedRunning,dontinterruptm--,Competing with General Anxiety Disorder,"Hey all. In recent months I have been dealing with lots of anxiety and OCD-related issues, and it has created this negative feedback loop with my running. I’ll have an upcoming race, then I’ll get nervous about it, and the anxiety will cause me to have diarrhea and stomach cramps to the point where I cannot—or can barely—compete. The other day I got through a 5k but was stuck in the bathroom constantly the rest of the day.

AdvancedRunning,livingStory1,HR vs Breathing as easiness metric?,"I am training for a 50 mile rice this September. I was trying to do an easy run. Garmin says my hr should be below 158 for an easy run. But I hear the talk test and I didn't have anyone to run with tonight, so I was just going by my breathing. I figured so long as I could breath through in and out only through my nose, it was an easy pace. 
I was still breathing easy albeit deeply through my nose. But heart rate kept creeping up to 161, even whole breathing easy. I was running about 9:30 pace. 
So I decided to test the breathing test. I just kept running faster while I could still breathe easily through my nose. Mile 5, I ran at a 8:30 pace and was still breathing in and out only through my nose (I was breathing faster through my nose, but never felt like I wasn't getting enough O2). 
My heart rate was about 175. This happen to anybody else?
How do you guys judge easiness to keep your easy runs truly easy?

I’m pretty sure that I won’t be able to complete the run in 80 degree, 100% humidity weather (before the sun comes out); but I’m certain I can hit goal pace on the treadmill and still feel like I’m getting work in. I need help deciding if I should do the long run on the treadmill or outside.

Pros of doing the workout on the treadmill: I have no doubt I can complete the workout at goal pace; it will still be a little warm in the room where I run; I want my legs to get used to running 6:25-6:30/mile pace for longer periods and I don’t think I can get this kind of turnover in this weather; I can simulate Boston’s hills on the ‘mill

Cons: for some reason my brain tells me I’m cheating because I probably couldn’t complete the workout outside, even though I know it’s 100% only because of the weather.",1628271689

AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Persistent Injury Weakpoints,"Hey all,

So to clarify for the mods, I am not asking for specific injury advice although I will share the area I've been dealing with. I'm more curious in folks luck dealing with their ""injury weak points"", or in other words the parts of their body that always seem to get hurt first. After several years of running you've probably run into one, generally for me they show up when I'm adding lots of elevation or fast mileage. I've tried all the basic protocols and none of them have been the ""easy fix"" they can be for noobs, and I wanted to get an idea of what those of you that've been successful have done to finally see the back of these persistent weak points.

To clarify a bit, my ""weak point"" is generally my Left IT band. I haven't had to skip a run for injury in over 2 years, and I haven't actually had my IT-Band be aggravated to the point of missing a run in something like 4. However, occasionally I'll feel the tightness in the lower knee pop up after speed workouts or tough long runs. It doesn't seem consistent or follow a pattern, and a series of weightlifting programs, SAM/MYRTL type routines, gait fixes, and weight loss haven't had it gone for good. 

To be clear, its gotten massively better. However, my ideal goal would be to get this feeling essentially the same as the rest of my legs. At this point I'm wondering if the cause is either

1. Some complicated biomechanical issue that hasn't been addressed by any of my routines or mobility work
2. Being caused by some non-running habit that's unduly stressing out the left leg. 

\#2 might seem a bit wonky or a bit of an excuse to some folks, but I have made lifestyle changes before that have had seen the back of several issues. Just for example, I had some persistent pain in my right hip that my doctor hypothesized might be due to hip impingement. Cue a high grade existential crisis over the future of my running. After about a year I realized the wonky angle in my car's driver seat was probably fucking up my hip. Now I drive sitting on top of a pillow, and problems are solved. 

So I'm curious, have you been able to permanently ""fix"" a consistent weak point of yours? If so, what was the fix?",1628214152

AdvancedRunning,hail0049,Need advice moving forward.,"Hello everyone,

This might be a bit long, so I appreciate your time.

Background: I am a 23 year old male. As for my running history, I ran one season of track in high school where I ran a 5:28 mile. Did not have any formal training at that time, and did not pursue running again until August 2020.

I started running again at the end of last August, as mentioned before. I began training using the Jack Daniels Running Formula (5k/10k plan), and went through a base phase of 6 weeks of light running, calisthenics, and strides. I ran a 2 mile time trial in 14:08 (roughly equivalent to a 22:30 5k). I began incorporating repetition workouts, tempo runs, v02 max workouts (such as 5X1000m, 4X1200) and ran 20:43 for the 5k at the end of October. I continued this training, and built my mileage to around 30 miles a week, and ran 19:56 for the 5k at the end of November.

After a grueling winter, I ran a 18:55 5k pb in March of this year. I stopped running in April due to a nervous breakdown, along with my Hashimoto's Thyroiditis symptoms worsening (it's an autoimmune condition). I switched to biking instead as I felt it was not as intense on the legs and I am getting treatment for both aforementioned health issues. 

In mid July 2021, I resumed running again and was shocked at how much fitness I lost, considering I was still physically active through cycling during my 2.5 month period away from running. I was barely able to run a mile at 6:25 pace. I resumed my training plan (adjusting paces of course) and ran a 20:49 5k on July 28, two weeks after than 1 mile run attempt.

I have a goal to run under 18 minutes for the 5k (maybe around 17:55-17:59) and under 37:30 for 10k before my 24th birthday in early December. If I were to achieve this, it would make me happy in ways I just can't explain. I am willing to work hard and be consistent again to achieve this goal.

Now for my questions

1. Is this realistic? If so, how should I pursue this goal (Considering I have put in a lot of mileage in my legs over the past year along with my decent progression).
2. I have only been relying on the Jack Daniels Running Formula for training. I don't know too much about supplemental training, strategies for increasing mileage, diet, etc. Is it worth getting a coach? Spending money isn't really a problem, as long as it will improve my chances of meeting my short term and long term running goals.",1628185473
AdvancedRunning,bjmcgeever,Getting into cycling and/or swimming,"My right thigh had been bothering me on and off since running a couple half marathons in March and April. I was never able to get up to full mileage (50ish) despite separate sections of one, one again, and then two weeks rest. Finally went to see an orthopedist and it looks like I have a stress reaction in my femur (shaft, not the joint). I'm expecting to be shut down fro at least 8 weeks.  

He said I could keep up my fitness with cycling or swimming, but I've never done either of those for fitness. Does anyone have any resources or suggestions on how to get started? Thanks!",1628179226

### Training
Lifelong runner who quit for a year and a half after college. I have done basically nothing but base building since January of 2019. Since then, I've faced setbacks and injuries which prevented me from getting properly into a 5K training plan. Over the last year though, I’ve established a baseline mileage of 20-25mpw and have been following Pfitzinger’s Faster Road Racing, so I do a long run and strides or a tempo each week. No 5K specific workouts though. I kept telling myself I wasn't ready or hadn't done enough training to race a 5K, but really I was probably just afraid that I wouldn't be happy with whatever time I was capable of doing, or that I wouldn't be good enough compared to my past self.

I was going to start a 5K plan in June, but I had a flare up of ankle pain, took a week off, and cut back my mileage. I got a bit tired of continuously having to push my racing back, and I was dying to see what I am actually capable of these days. In October 2018, just before I officially got back into running, I managed to knock out a 19:30 5K, so that is where I set my sights.

### Race Strategy
I wanted to make sure I was in control the whole time so I aimed for an even split for most of the race, and whatever I had left in the last mile/half mile I would just put it all on the line. I set a pace target for somewhere between 19:00 - 19:30 pace to allow me to adjust my pace depending on how I was feeling at mile 1 and mile 2.

At mile 1, I wanted to be somewhere around 6:00 - 6:10, without going out too fast. At mile 2, I was hoping to be around 12:00 - 12:20. If I felt good, I would aim for 18:00 or faster for mile 3. If not, somewhere around 18:15-18:30 would be good. And then hopefully I'd have enough gas in the tank at the end for a kick.

### Pre-race
Woke up at 6am, threw on my clothes and shoes (no spikes just my regular ol’ trainers), packed a bag and drove over to the course. I have type 1 diabetes so I also had a sugary drink after I woke up to raise my blood sugar, since running always brings me low. I felt incredibly nervous most of the time I was getting ready.

When I got to the course, I warmed up for 10 mins, starting out at an easy/recovery pace and slowly working up to tempo-ish pace towards the end. I did some dynamic warmup stretches, knocked out a few strides, and got on the starting line. My fiance generously agreed to my race official, so she gave me my commands and started her watch.

### Race
Went through 1K at 3:40, a bit fast but I was feeling good. I tried to reel it in a bit and settle into a 3:48km / 6:07mi pace. 

My 2K split was 4:05 on the watch, but the area I was going through was pretty wooded so I think the GPS could’ve lost me for a bit so it might have been a bit faster.

I am fully expecting this to end up on r/RunningCirclejerk: my 3K split was 4:02, but I was in trouble: I suddenly felt like I desperately had to use the bathroom. My pre-race nerves had prevented me from taking care of that beforehand. I had to actually stop for 15 seconds or so to get my bearings, but the clock kept ticking. I was feeling really dejected at this point but I convinced myself I had to keep going even if it wasn’t a perfect effort.

At 4K my split was 4:04, and again I felt my body rebelling against me, so I had to stop for another beat. It was really discouraging but I made myself give whatever I had left for that final kilometer. 

I managed to make it across the finish line, and my fiance timed me at 20:00.04. Incredibly disappointing to be just 0.05s short of my most conservative goal, but all things considered, not terrible. I knew I had a lot more in me, and if I wasn’t running solo and I didn’t face those other issues throughout the time trial, I probably could have hit 19:30 or faster.

### Post-race
I was pretty dejected immediately after I finished. I drank a bit of water, hit the bathroom, and went on a 10 minute cooldown jog. 

I came to terms with what happened and told myself I can and will do better. Not every race is going to be perfect and we’re all going to have bad days, but it’s better to get out there and have a shitty day than not get out there at all. So overall, I’m glad that I went through with it, and I’m excited to try it again.

### What's next?
Probably going to continue building my base for the next month or two, hoping to establish a baseline of 25-30mpw. I am signed up for a 5K race in mid-November, so I want to transition to a 5K training plan with at least 8-10 weeks to spare before that.

AdvancedRunning,PM_ME_WARMASTERALFYN,How do you run fast for yourself?,"I ran a relay race today. It went very well, and I had a great time. I realized at the end of it, however, that I probably could have been less cautious with pacing my legs of the race. Specifically, I felt as if I was hesitant to push myself hard in the last leg of the race.

This seems to be a pattern for me: during track I'd routinely fall 20-30sec/mi pace slower than what I knew I could run. I feel as if I am unwilling to push myself hard in races.

Do you all have any advice to manage this? My current idea of what to do is that if I can push myself really hard in practice I can do the same in races. Any other ideas?",1628138911
AdvancedRunning,northernguy,Run/walk specs,"I’ve been testing out run:walk alternating, a la Higdon, and plan to try it in my next marathon (my 16th). Do other folks here do that? What has been your favorite ratio of walk to run times? Also, do you try to speed walk or just relax on the walk part?",1628118557
AdvancedRunning,Emil_1996,Some questions about what shoes to get,"So I have this problem, that my right foot is 1 full EU size bigger than my left foot, so 46 for my right and 45 for my left. It's also ""fatter"" on the height and who knows, it might as well be wider too cause it fits much, much harder than my left foot.

With my current shoes, that needs replacing, I literally have to wear 2 socks on my left to even make it somewhat similar, but it's still tighter on my right foot.   


I need new shoes for powerwalking/running and I don't know what to get, I got wide feet and I tend to walk a bit on the outside of my feet, so I need something that helps me stabilize my feet, as otherwise they tend to hurt sometimes when I run. 

Are the Nike Pegasus even an option for my wide feet or should I forget about them? They look nice and that's something important for me too, I don't want any boat looking shoes, I like them slim.  


Thank you.",1628117913

My question is if Kipchoge's 26.2 mile running ability would transfer directly to 50, 100, etc distances.

Our Principal Sponsor, John Hancock, would like to extend a bib to you for having one of the closest times to this year’s official qualification cutoff.  We’d like to celebrate that outstanding achievement and invite you to toe the line in Hopkinton this October. (Please note entry into the 2021 Boston Marathon is $230.)

 

We recognize that running this year’s marathon puts you on a shorter training regimen than usual. However, if you would like to participate, we will promptly share registration details. The deadline to register is approaching, so please advise on your decision by Monday, August 9.

We hope you will join us in Boston for the 125th running of the Boston Marathon. Congratulations!

I run 60-65 mpw regularly and my long run is 12-14 miles and my 5k is 15:54.  How far should I go before I turn around if I’m doing out and back?,1628088132
AdvancedRunning,Complex-Deer,Anyone had any experience with posterior shin splints?,I got really bad shin splints on the inside of my leg (posterior tibial tendon) after my long run and it is hasn’t really gotten any better after 3 days of no running. It isn’t painful to touch and no swelling at all is visible. What exercises can I do to get back to running? In the mean time I’m going to swim to (hopefully) maintain my fitness— what are some good workouts that can simulate tempo runs and other summer-type workouts?,1628081062

We've only had like 15 days to train and via training I realized we'd probably be lucky to hit 65s and 75s, respectively. Do recreational runners or non-college athletes participate in these meets?

I (24/M) started running last november, so not even a year at the moment. My main problem is I am getting bored at road running, and want to start trailrunning as my main running.

AdvancedRunning,NotTheTrueKing,Is there room for improvement for a low-mileage runner?,"I used to run back in high school and never was able to scale up my mileage much due to injuries and breaks for various other reasons. In my last season in junior year, I did 20-30 miles a week (generally on the lower end) and ran a 5:28 mile after 2 months of training off a month's break. I'm wondering how much room for improvement I could possibly have with my PR's taking into account my mileage (I'm still in my 20's so I don't think age would affect me too much). 


For additional context, I ran for a bit a year ago after another lengthy break (4 months), before lockdowns, and hit a 5:52 solo time trial mile off of inconsistent 20 mile weeks that I did over a period of 3 months. I'm guessing that effort would be closer to where I am right now (not training).",1628040946

AdvancedRunning,bigdog108277,Is this overtraining syndrome?,"I am a avid marathoner/ultramarathoner who has a coach and runs 40-60 miles per week on average and I typically do 2-3 marathons annually plus 1 ultra. I am getting older as I am in my mid 40’s and I seem to have hit a wall in the summer heat. I have been doing this for years so I thought I knew what it felt like. However, recently I have lost over a minute on my easy pace and some times struggle to even run a mile without my heart rate sky rocketing. I went to the doctor and had a full battery of blood work done and everything was normal. My coach had me take 4 days off but it did nothing. I feel ok when not running, it is just while doing the thing I love. Top end speed has also disappeared. I struggle to even reach the paces I ran whole marathons at just a few years ago.  I have dropped out of my 100 miler at the end of the year and feel totally devastated. Any thoughts?",1628016754

I do roughly 30 miles a week(previously 40ish mpw in training blocks)  but will have the time to do more next year. My question: is a sub 3 marathon realistic after 40?

AdvancedRunning,crimsonhues,Carrying tailwind w/o water bottle during marathon,"2021 NYC marathon will be my first time running marathon distance. NYCM provides Gatorade at aid stations. I’d like to carry my own sports electrolyte (tailwind or Skratch) although I am not keen on carrying a water bottle. Does anyone have experience carrying single stick packets and mixing those with water at aid stations? 

I’m prone to cramping so tailwind will be ideal given higher sodium/magnesium per serving. Something I need to practice during my training runs.

Any guidance or thoughts will be appreciated.",1628007457
AdvancedRunning,No-Pressure7867,What do I need to break 2 in the 800m and 4:30 in the 1600m?,"&amp;#x200B;

Gonna say this will be a long read, I'm sorry but there's a lot I need to say.

I'm an HS runner (16M) going into Junior year and XC season is about a month away. I improved by massive amounts over the spring, going from 5:28 to 4:52 in the 16, 2:24 to 2:09 in the 8(ran this time on a track that was basically half concrete, teammates said that would've been 2:08-06 on a better track), and 11:40 to 10:59 in the 32. I credit a large amount of these improvements to being a lot healthier and improving my mobility/flexibility after having \~5 months of injury total beforehand. I've made it a personal goal to make it to states in the open 8/16, which in my region is a 2:00/4:30 respectively. I'm still not sure if those are actually my best events or if I still have a bad aerobic base from my injuries, which weren't very long ago. This is where the 5k comes in. I've always had a very mediocre time (19:20), and I'm not sure if I'm just naturally not wired for endurance (I do heavy positive splits in all my races, the 2:09 was 60-69) or if I'm just lazy with my aerobics(like mile reps, long tempos and long runs), which my teammates have told me, but I always make sure to feel like I'm working like I should when I do them, e.g I felt out of breath going 8:00 for an 8 mile long run, which is awful in my team. So that makes me wonder if grinding for around sub 17 in the 5k will give me enough endurance to be able to hold the paces needed to break 2 and 4:30. Another thing that I've been trying to do is getting back into the weight room. I've done it before in the summer of 2020 before my first injury. However looking back on it I was doing it very incorrectly, this time I'm incorporating things like plyometrics and more stability exercises, and doing more quality than quantity in lifting, but I'm not sure as to how I should structure myself there, a high schooler designing workouts makes for a pretty disorganized schedule.

TL;DR Got a lot faster after injury, want to get faster but not sure if my aerobics are holding me back and how to incorporate lifting/plyometrics progressively and safely.

What do you think? Sorry if the post is so long",1628005700
AdvancedRunning,StrangeMorris,Tiredness after higher intensity runs,"How do other busy individuals deal with being tired after more intensive runs? I eat well and get the best night's sleep I can. I'm sure having kids has something to do with it, but it's annoying because it makes me want to not push myself hard because I don't want to be tired the next day.",1627998613
AdvancedRunning,DunnoWhatToPutSoHi,Perhaps not an advanced question - but regarding nutrition,"So, if anyone watches youtube of like distance runners triathletes etc you see them taking all these supplements. Say nick bare - strong greens, reds, joints etc etc. 

My question, as an average runner looking to to do my first marathon in October (preferably under 4 hours) would any of this kind of stuff be useful or is it just them trying to sell stuff for themselves or sponsors? My diet incorporates plenty of vegetables etc (and chocolate unfortunately, need to lose a few lb but that's another story). Losing weight would do more for me than any of these supplements no doubt about it. But could something like strong joints alongside the diet benefit me in anyway or is it just people trying to sell things?

Alongside that if anyone has any suggestions of anything that would actually benefit your average runner fire away and it'd be much appreciated. I take electrolytes during long runs, protein powder from time to time &amp; a multivitamin but that's about it.

Thank you very much",1627975341

AdvancedRunning,SRV1981,5K training and Paces,"I’m trying to apply what I’m learning about physiology and metabolic systems to training. 

I’m trying to figure out how to differentiate creating workouts for 5k runners when contrasting 5k goal pace workouts vs. v02 max pace (3k pace). 

For example:

2(3x1k with equal rest between reps) 5m between sets at 5k goal pace. 

Or 4x1 mile at 5k goal pace with equal rest as a peaking workout. 

How would v02 max workouts differ if they’re closer to 3k pace work? What would the volume, intensity, distance of reps look, and rest?",1627956854
AdvancedRunning,laurieislaurie,What does your strength training routine look like?,"I've recently gained access to a gym and to supplement my running I've been using the squat rack, and doing a much more intense core workout. What do you do?


Additional question: I'm skinny, as I'm sure many of you are. When I use the squat rack, the bar runs against my vertebrae and hurts. I looked up some info online about correct bar position, and got better at it, but as soon as I increased weight, it hurt again. Any tips from a skinny person? I've seen you can buy a squat 'comfort' pad but most people say you don't need one with proper form. But I'm wondering if any of those people are as skinny as me...",1627946783
AdvancedRunning,cauthon,How long to safely/conservatively train from nothing to a half marathon?,"Hi,

I'm 31M in a bit of a unique situation. I ran cross country/track in high school, mostly gave it up in college, and have been running off and on for the past 6-7 years. I most recently ran 20-25mpw in 2019-2020, with some intent to build up to a half.

I had heart surgery this April to address a congenital defect, which obviously put my training on pause. I've been working with cardiac rehab for the past month to safely resume exercise, and I'm currently doing about the equivalent of the first week of couch to 5k (~20min of 60-90s intervals on a treadmill). 

I'd still like to train for a half, and I'm curious how early would be reasonable to run one if I'm primarily interested in completion rather than time. (I'm curious from a running training/injury perspective, not a cardiac/medical perspective - I'm planning to stay in touch with rehab and they've been supportive of me resuming running.) I've thought about continuing with the C25k equivalent for the next month or two, then jumping into Hal Higdon's novice base + half plans, possibly targeting a mid April 2022 race. Would that be a reasonable goal, or should I give myself more time to build base to avoid injury? 

I've taken breaks from running before, but never for so long, and I always had other forms of exercise so I could jump back into running a few 5ks a week without much trouble. Restarting from scratch like this is new to me. I'd really appreciate any advice, I'm primarily interested in figuring out what goals make sense for me and resuming a training schedule without injury. (And if this isn't sufficiently ""advanced"" for the subreddit please let me know and I'll post elsewhere.)

Thanks!",1627937910
AdvancedRunning,ngomaam,Product Review: District Vision Junya Racer sunglasses," [Junya Racer Black, D+ G15 — District Vision](https://districtvision.com/products/junya-racer-black-d-g15) 

Just wanted to offer a brief review of these sunglasses. Aside from the style (which is subjective ofc, but I think it looks very good but in a more conservative way I guess - I have a smaller oval face), these are the best sport sunglasses I've tried. Granted, I haven't tried a lot (Goodr, Oakley, some random Amazon brands), but I have no complaints with these at all. Super light and zero bounce when running at any pace, have never had to even slightly adjust once I put these on. They fit over my beats power beats pro headphones and does not interfere with that hook, nor does placing the frame arms on the headphone hook alter the stability or position of the glasses. I'm also asian, and there's no ""asian fit"" offered here, but it fits perfectly over my flatter asian nose. The lightness and flex also make it very comfy to wear on your head or over a hat. 

Have not experienced any fogging at all, although I don't live in a humid area, but it has been more humid than average lately, and my last run was ran in about 60% humidity. 

I also use these for cycling, and again, no complaints there at all, with the same pros listed above. I haven't tested the durability of these but I can't imagine these not lasting forever with proper care. 

My complete head kit: Satisfy running hat, beats powerbeats pro and these shades. It's an investment but it has been completely worth it imo.",1627936521
AdvancedRunning,edgarvanburen,Confused by Tune Up Races in Pfitzinger HM Plan,"I am following the Half Marathon Schedule 1: 31-47 miles/week plan from p. 224 of Faster Road Racing. On weeks 5 and 2 (weeks to goal, that is) there are ""8k-10k tune up races"" but the total listed for that day is actually 10 miles/16 km. 

I'm confused by this, but maybe I'm overthinking it. Would you interpret this as a recommendation for a 2 mile warmup + 2 mile cooldown on top of a 10k race? 

I looked for clarification in the ""Following the Schedules"" of p. 216-217 but did not find anything.",1627930805
AdvancedRunning,Thesmartguava,Can a recovery run be too slow?,"I’m an incoming D1 cross-country runner; my cross country 5k is 18:10, and my 2 mile is 10:40. I’ve been running my recovery run at an 8:00 minute/mile pace. But a lot of the other girls on the college team have been running 7:30-7:50. Is it wasting miles to be running that slow? Should I go faster?",1627928998
AdvancedRunning,NuclearNeptune,3 Mile Training,"I am training to take a fitness test to get into Air Force special operations where the run component is 3 miles in 22 mins or less. I am a 20y/o M with 30mpw. I weigh 170lbs.

I run Mon-Sat. Mon: 30min easy run, Tues: track workout, Wed: 40min run, Thur: track workout, Fri: Long run (7-9 miles), and Sat is another easy long run for 40-60 mins. Easy/ Long runs are 8:30-9:00 pace to keep a low heart rate.

My current 3 miles PR is 20:04. I would like to get to 18:00. I’ve been following that plan above for about 2 months now along with lifting. Is there anything I should change about this strategy? I plan on testing in Sept.",1627928375

I'm recovering from a bout of pneumonia. Today is 8 days after diagnosis, and day 8 of a 10 day course of amoxicillin plus azithromycin. I haven't ran or done anything remotely physical for 9 days.

I am due to run London Marathon in 9 weeks. So, what would you do to get to the start line in as best shape as possible? I wanted to run a PB effort and I have a soft PB of 3:03, off minimal training. I am 40-50 mpw when in a marathon cycle.

So, **defer**? (The defer guidance is due out on 17th August. Although I have a GFA place from 2019, so am not hopeful this will be an option to me).

**Rest** and take another week off and do an 8 week plan.

**Retire**, and take up yoga, some things are just not meant to be.

If, I was to do an 8 week plan, what would you include as key workouts? 

Yours hopefully and derangedly optimistic.

AdvancedRunning,eled34,Looking for encouragement - NYC Marathon,"Hi All,

I’m looking for some encouragement/guidance on goal-setting for the NYC Marathon in November. I ran it in 2018 as my first marathon and finished in 4:46. 

Since then, I caught the bug and have been through 3 years of running, averaging anywhere from 20-70mpw generally. Ran 3 marathons independently in a six month span while backpacking in 2019 and have spent 2 summers training heavy in FL/TX heat. I’m ignoring the times from the 3 marathons, as I had no aid stations and was firmly bonking by the second half in all of them (all run in 70-80+ degree heat too).

I’m looking ahead to November and would be so pumped if I could shave an hour off my original 4:46 time. I comfortably ran 10 miles this AM in 80-90+ degree heat with hills mirroring the worst of NYC at a 9:06 clip, staying aerobic (Z1-Z2) for the whole run. Am fairly confident I could hit 1:45-1:50 if I pushed maximally on a half in perfect conditions right now, just don’t want to get hurt trying.

Do you think the 3:46 time is achievable? Any encouragement would be awesome, thanks!",1627858396
AdvancedRunning,moose_truce,Top of the foot pain for the last 6 months,"In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

 I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",1627848593

AdvancedRunning,Juany_12,Help with Nutritional Info Sheet,"I help coach a hs xc team and the info sheet is ridiculous. One example: It says that you should avoid eggs, sausage and bacon for breakfast….I’m struggling with coming up with a sheet that doesn’t steal other peoples work because I’m not a nutritionist, but I ran in college and saw many have eating disorders and want to try and educate as much as possible to avoid that.

AdvancedRunning,hauuzer_perrone,Will I ever get back to my old racing weight after years of heavy lifting?,"Previous competitive runner through high school and college, most of my PRs were made when I was ~135 - 140 lbs. 

After stepping away from racing I started heavy lifting for aesthetics for ~10 years and gained a significant amount of mass.

I’ve been putting more of my focus on marathons the last 2 years and I honestly think that endurance training will benefit my health and lifestyle more in the long run as opposed to excessive mass.

I’ve been on a strict diet and running 60 - 80 miles a week over that last 2 years. I did lose a lot of weight initially, I look very lean/cut, but I’m still 30 lbs over my old racing weight. I’ve hit a plateau in my weight loss and my running progress probably over the last 6 months.

I’m obviously not gonna starve myself or put myself in an eating disorder as that would be terrible for my health.

AdvancedRunning,gimlidorf,Jack Daniels 1500m to 3000m plan,"Hello all,

Just curious to know if anyone has used the JD 1500m to 3000m plan

I'm 33M casual runner. 5k pb 19.15. I've upped my mileage from 30km per week for many years to 60-70 over the last 12 months with long runs of 18-25km. 

I quite enjoy the faster shorter distances and the speed work which goes with it so I thought I'd give it a go. 

I have two questions in particular.

1)The first 2 phases of JD's plans have alot of 200/400 reps where the goal is to run fast to improve techinque/economy. The recommended time is about your 1500m time. (Or whatever is in the Vdot table). Is there any harm in running these faster? (Kinda fun to go a bit quicker!)

2)JD recommends long runs upto 25% of mileage. This is common thing in many of his plans from what I can see. With 70km this would be upto 18km long runs. If I feel fine doing longer runs (usually 21-24km every second week) is there any down side?

Thanks

AdvancedRunning,FigDramatic,"Anyone else lean, but weights a lot","This is going to be a dumb post, but its something that's been rattling around my brain for a long time.

I am 6ft tall, but I weight 185 pounds. I know BMI is flawed, but that puts me in the overweight category. I do actually feel heavy when I run and I suspect my weight could be a (even if small) factor in injury or muscle fatigue.

Here's the thing. My waist is 31 "" and my abdominal muscles are visible. I don't have much fat around my gut area, its only if I sit down that I can pinch some stomach. The same with my arms and legs, no visible fat. Everyone I run with comments about me being lean and looking in shape.

I often put on my wifes t-shirts by mistake and she weights 110 pounds.

I am a high mileage runner (well high for me), I always hangout around 50 miles a week.

I do very little weight lifting and have no past as someone who focused on developing muscle. My cross training is on a bike (when I don't run I do an hour or so on zwift with a smart trainer).

This is not even a calroies in / calories out question. I can limit calories, but then I notice my training trends down and I just don't feel great. Starving all the cold just that little bit easier. My diet is vegan. I mainly eat sweet potatos , brown rice, veggies and bananas. I replaced peanut butter for PB Fit (a powder with the oil removed).

Meanwhile I know guys who are 155lbs as a natural weight and I can't see a lot of difference in their frame size. Yet I am carrying the equilvant of a 16kg kettle bell.

I guess I just need to live with this and shut up / put up. But I needed to rant and see if anyone finds themselves in the same situation.

Let's be honest, if this is the total of my problems I am doing OK, but hey, I love running and like you all I look for anything which will see me improve.",1627796604
AdvancedRunning,homechefdit,Should I include super easy miles in weekly mileage?,"I'm training somewhat loosely for a virtual marathon. My plan was to run about 50 miles per week including a long run on Saturday that maxes out at 22 miles. I'm planning on running the marathon at \~9 min pace, most of my training is at 10-10:30, except for a track workout. It's my first marathon in a while but I've trained with a plan like this before, and am reasonably confident this will get me there. 

  
However, my daughter signed up for a half marathon and I decided to run with her during her training for company. She runs at approx 14-15 min pace all in (with walking as needed). Her plan goes from 15-25 miles per week. 

  
My question - should I include the runs with her in my 50 miles per week? They're easy pace, but a lot of time on feet. Today, for example, I ran 8.5 on my own, then 6.5 with her. Should I count this as a 14 mile run, less than 14 or (based on time on feet) more than 14?",1627792139
AdvancedRunning,Acoww123,How do I get back into running?,"Hello all! Sorry if the formatting is strange as Im on mobile. 

To make a long story short, I started running high school xc/track about 5 years ago, due to the Pandemic(and being sick the last week high school was in session with covid-like symptoms) I lost my last track season and honestly all motivation to run. I was never a D1 athlete at the sport but I always managed to do my distance runs and finish races with times I was proud of. 

However, ever since the pandemic between the covid 15 and the freshmen 15, Ive found it increasingly hard to get back into running shape and the old way of training I used to do doesn’t seem to be cutting it with keeping me motived to continue trying. I want to be able to run at least my peak 5k time by the end of the year (25-7/7:30/7:30ish) but I struggle finishing 2 miles at sub 19(8:30ish/10:30ish). Im honestly just feeling defeated and need some advice as to where to start. 

My old schedule was M-F. 
Monday: long day: 5-8 miles
Tuesday: easy medium-3-4miles
Wednesday: medium hard 4-5miles
Thursday: Track workout: 3-4miles fast paced.
Friday: medium day 3-4
Saturday: maybe a race if not no run
Sunday: no run ever. 

As Im still a full time student and have a part time job Id like to keep a similar schedule of M-F but once again Im not sure where to start. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you :)",1627782021
AdvancedRunning,hereforfunbel,College club team in San Diego in need of coach,"Hi, posted this in r/ crosscountry too:

I've reached out to all the coaches I could find on the San Diego Track Club website and RRCA's website as well. I've found 1 who said is interested, but has not responded in some time even with a follow up. Does anyone else know of a way we could find other coaches?

AdvancedRunning,benfullofswag,Questions about Daniels Half Marathon Training,"Hi everyone! I'm currently training for a half marathon using the Jack Daniels ""alien"" method (basically one T run per week, and alternating between one R/I run and one L/M run every other week). I like it because it allows for so much flexibility, but because of that flexibility I have some questions. 

1) How much to build up? I'm currently running 35-40 mpw. Not sure what to aim for as a peak, or how to strategize getting there. Does peaking not matter so much in training for a half as opposed to a full marathon?

2) How much to taper? The plan only has one week of taper before the race. Is that enough, or should I taper more? Does this also not matter as much in half marathon training?

3) I'm planning to do a tune-up 10K six-ish weeks before the HM. How should I pace myself for that? Should I go all-out (to update my VDOT score/change workout paces accordingly), or should I practice HM pace?

4) I'm also having trouble setting goals. My original hope was to go sub-1:30, but I recently did my first ever 5k-focused block of training and smashed my PR by over a minute (new PR 19:03). That was just before this HM-focused training block, and I used that time to calculate my VDOT paces, which suggest that 1:30 is very achievable for me at my current fitness level. 

For reference, my previous HM PR was 1:37 (part of buildup for a marathon in early 2019). During lockdown, I focused on building my aerobic base, and I've averaged 25-35 mpw over the past 18 months (all-time peak 48 miles). This is a lot more consistent mileage than I've ever done before (probably closer to 10-20 mpw for a couple of years), and I feel like I'm in the best aerobic shape of my life. Hoping to push myself in this upcoming HM. 

I really enjoy reading other people's experiences on this sub. Looking for any/all advice you have on my #breaking90project.",1627756601

AdvancedRunning,Hrdrock,Race Day Fluids,"Coming up on my first marathon in 4 weeks. I ran my first half marathon last year. The course was a repeated loop without designated aid stations, but I was able to drop a few bottles at the start/finish line and thus run bottle free. The marathon I’ll be doing next month will have a total of 12 aid stations with Gatorade/water at each. For my training runs I’ve been carrying a water bottle waist strap and consume anywhere from 500 mL for 8-10 mi up to 1.25 L for 15 mi runs. Judging how my training has gone, I’m assuming I’ll perform best in the marathon by consuming 1.5-2 L of total liquid over 26.2 mi. Id prefer to run without a waist strap, but I would like to make sure I can reasonably consume that much liquid just from the aid stations. 

How do you simulate this in your training? Take a water bottle but only drink every 3 mi to simulate the distance to each aid station? Also, thoughts on consuming Gatorade day of the race when I use Skratch drink mix for training?",1627740302

AdvancedRunning,_Vexation_,Goal setting for junior year.,"Hi y’all,

I’m just looking for what goals I should set for this cross country this year. I have three years running experience and am currently a 16 yo junior. I’ve only run in the summer one year before this summer at around 45 MPW with a max of 50 and then around 20-35 mpw in the season with two workouts intervals etc. This summer I’ve run 500 miles since the beginning of June or around 60 MPW (all in singles) since then and (unlike last summer) planning to keep this up for the rest of the season while including workouts (800 repeats 400 repeats tempos etc) just like in years before. My soph year PRs are 5k 17:29, mile: 4:55, 800: 2:09, 2 mile: 11:02 (5k split), 400: 56 high depending on race. My frosh year PR was 19:30 and we didn’t have track. What do y’all think I should set my goals for the 5k this year? Hoping for sub 16:15 or sub 16 but that may be a stretch and I’d like input. My most impressive workout last year was probably 8x800 with one minute rest in average 2:35 on sand of that makes any difference. Also recently (within the past week) did a half marathon easy long run average 7:20 pace while keeping HR at 160 if that makes any difference either.

Thanks in advance

AdvancedRunning,ChrisHeinonen,Pfitz 18/70 speed work,"I start the 18/70 plan next week for CIM (43 years old, sub-3:00 is the goal, but staying healthy is the main goal) and have a solid base of 45-55 mile weeks the past few months. But I also am going to go run Fifth Ave Mile in six weeks as part of my work team as we try to defend our title in the media mile against Runners World (thankfully during the recovery week of Pfitz). So I want to try to keep some speed work going the next 6 weeks to do that, as I've had to skip it the last three years due to injuries or COVID.

I was considering throwing in some speed work on one General Aerobic day per week (not replacing LT work or anything else) and not doing a ton of distance (1.5-2 miles maximum) for the speed just to stay fresh. Switching to 12/70 is an option, but seems worse. Or should I just hope I keep my mile fitness (5:11 earlier this summer) and follow Pfitz to focus on CIM, though I'd rather perform well at 5th Ave Mile than CIM I think.",1627690707
AdvancedRunning,UnnamedRealities,Evaluating time trial progress - weather adjustment?,"TL;DR: Do any of you apply a weather adjustment to normalize your time trials for monitoring progress and adjusting pace targets for workouts? In particular I'm interested in adjustments for mile and 5k time trials - anything from rough adjustments that are rules of thumb to fancy formulas and charts.

I'm training for a November HM (and December trail 50k) and I'm trying to run time trials every 3 to 5 weeks on the same day around the same time, but that's not always feasible because of rain and life constraints. One time may be right around sunrise when it's 69° with 80% humidity and overcast. The next time it might be 85° with 65% humidity mid-morning with no clouds. Worse still, I usually run 2.5 miles to get to the track - it's a nice warmup, but I'm going into the time trial half-soaked instead of dry coming out of an air conditioned building or vehicle.

What adjustment approaches do you use to normalize time trial results for distances like 1 mile and 5k?",1627686857

AdvancedRunning,ABrooksBrother,Pfitz 18/70 MP Runs,"Hey everyone!

This weekend I’ll be kicking ass doing 18 miles with 10 at MP (6:42/mile). I’m wondering about footwear, I have two ideas in my head:

1) Rock a pair of Brooks Hyperion Tempos or Endorphin Speeds for the 8 miles while building up to MP, quickly stop (less than 30 seconds) and change into my Endorphin Pros for the 10 @ MP

2) Rock the Endorphin Pros for the full 18 miles and let it ride baby.

I also had a 10:40 2 mile race that was ran poorly (5:00 5:40 splits). That summer I trained harder than I ever had, running 5-6 days a week, never skipping workouts, etc. But when xc finally came around I barely dropped under 18 min in the 5k and track was equally as disappointing.

AdvancedRunning,MrDilkington1,I'm at the end of my tether. I'm looking for knee recovery success stories. Please help.,"I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

Just please someone tell me a positive fuckin story I can relate to...

Thanks if you got this far, sorry for causing your eyes to go into the back of your head too.",1627496703
AdvancedRunning,KataraTheKat,Adjusting to Elevation - Mental Game,"I am a 28yo woman who recently (June 1) moved to the Denver suburbs from Boston.  I am training for the Chicago Marathon and have set some big goals for myself, based on the fitness I was in in Boston (using the VDot/ Jack Daniels calculator).

I have done a lot of reading and talking to people -- and I KNOW elevation takes time to adjust to.  My problem is the mental game, I'm trying my hardest to leave my ego at the door, but my heart rate is super high even at a 9:30+ pace on my easy days and I'm exhausted.  I did my longest training run this weekend so far 13.1 miles at about a 9:30 pace and just feel super defeated.  I try to go early in the morning, but I still work east coast hours, so I log in at 6:30am.. it's not always possible!

How can I adjust my training plan to meet my new environment? I feel constantly out of shape and I'm worried I'll just keep pushing myself harder and harder and continue to be disappointed. I appreciate any links to training plans or articles about training at elevation.  I'm extremely competitive and goal oriented so this has been a tough training cycle for me.",1627493521
AdvancedRunning,blxcklst,Salomon vs Camelbak hydration vests for long trail runs?,"I'm looking to buy a hydration vest that can be used with a bladder, for 30+ mile (ideally up to 50/100 mil distances but I've got a 30 mile mountain race in 2 months so primarily for that!) trail runs, usually quite hilly so it's at least 6 hours at a time (my 30 miler will have aid stops every 10 miles but i'd rather be overprepared than under).

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Is there a reason why Camelbak hydration vests aren't that popular, am I missing something? How good are Salomon bladders when used with Adv Skin 5? Do they leak at all?

Bonus question for women: has anyone bought either Camelbak Circuit 1.5 Women's, or Salomon Adv Skin 8 (the one designed specifically for women's build) vests? Would they be worth investing? I'm usually a bit wary of any unisex gear or clothes because of different fits!",1627492370
AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Workout of the Week - Yasso 800s,"Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent  specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas:

* A new workout
* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is Yasso 800s**.

*History:*

Invented by Bart Yasso, a writer for Runner's World.

*What:*

Yasso 800s in theory are supposed to predict your marathon time: your time in minutes and seconds for a workout of 10x800 meters with equal recovery time is the same as the hours and minutes of your marathon time. 

For example: 10x800 in 2:45 per rep with 2:45 recovery should mean you can run a 2:45 marathon.

*When:*

Pretty obviously it is for marathon training. MacMillan recommends doing two or three Yasso 800s spread out through your marathon cycle. The creator of the workout says to start several months out from your marathon and work your way up from 4x800 to 10x800, peaking 2 weeks before the goal marathon.

________________

*Note that this is just a theory. I'll be honest - I've seen more people claim is doesn't work than those that claims it does work. But hey, on the bright side it still gets you 8k of speedwork! And if you do try it out, let us know how well it predicted.*",1627479724
AdvancedRunning,Percinho,Reuters | Salazar permanently banned from track and field due to misconduct,"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/salazar-permanently-banned-track-field-due-misconduct-2021-07-27/

&gt; The U.S. Center for SafeSport has barred coach Alberto Salazar permanently from track and field citing sexual and emotional misconduct, according to its centralized disciplinary database on Monday.

&gt; Under SafeSport rules, Salazar has 10 business days to request arbitration, which would be conducted by an independent party. SafeSport declined to comment on Tuesday.

This has come in largely under the radar as there doesn't appear to have been an announcement, just an updating of his database entry. It appears to be independent of his doping ban but Mary Cain went on record with how bad her personal experience under Salazar was.

So I just completed my first marathon over the weekend (4:44). It was nothing fast or fancy but my goal was too cross the finish line and I did just that. My question was, I was planning on signing up for a trail marathon in October and was wondering is this too soon to get back at it? This whole week has been dedicated to recovering (stretching/rolling out etc) and next week I planned on going on a few light runs at super low intensity.

""Working Stiff"" from the LetsRun message board put together Joe Klecker's training log from the Week of March 16 to the present day.

Klecker finished a strong third in the 10,000m at the U.S. Olympic Trials last month to make his first Olympic team. He ran ridiculously even splits, going out in 13:58ish &amp; coming back in 13:56ish for his final time of 27:54.90.

This is pretty much his entire build.

Ritz started coaching him on the Week of May 25 and you can immediately see his fingerprints on it. If you don't know, a famous workout that Ritz loves is the ""Ritz Fartlek"" or the ""Double Ladder,"" where it goes 1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2-1 with equal rests. That workout crushes mere mortals, but Klecker does it as part of a 15 mi morning, followed by a 5 mi double.

More recently I started running again. I am on week 4 or 5 of my 18 week marathon training, with the race in mid October. I’ve done many half marathons, too many shorter races to count, and 2 successful marathons with a pace I’m very happy with, so I’m an experienced runner. 

For this race I am focusing a lot more on healthy eating, recovery, and drinking less. 

I’ve never lifted weights during an intense running schedule, and I’m not so sure its a good idea. 5x5s start every session with squats, which I’ve cut out completely. 

Has anyone done any sort of complimentary lifting program that doesn’t detract from; or better yet: enhanced your running? If the answer is simple “don’t do it” use your off days for better recovery and stretching, that makes total sense to me.

AdvancedRunning,consolationLog,Choosing a target marathon time after two new PRs,"Hey guys,

I started \[30M\] running about 2 years ago and only the last year and a half of that has been consistent 5+ days/week running. Once I had an aerobic base that allowed me to run almost everyday without feeling like death, I started doing Hal Higdon plans then Pfitzinger. Recently though, I've just been running 6 days a week, repeating something that resembles mid-plan Pfitzinger with most runs being about an hour at easy pace, with one tempo workout, and finishing with a Sunday long run of 2-3hrs. I hover anywhere from 50-70 miles a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[ran my first solo marathon in 3:27 in April\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mkp58e/first\_ever\_marathon\_32752/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mkp58e/first_ever_marathon_32752/)) then did a 30 miler in May for my 30th birthday at a slightly slower pace. Recently in the past two months though, I've made some major lifestyle changes that have resulted in what feel like massive boosts to my fitness: I quit drinking caffeine and quit smoking weed. Both have been major vices in my life and somehow, I was smoking everyday while building fitness the entire time. I even ran the 30mi high as hell!

&amp;#x200B;

After the mild withdrawal period ended, I attempted a 5k on the track with the intention of trying to hold onto 6min/mi pace. To my surprise, I ran a 17:49 and stuck to 5:45/mi pace with no issue. It even felt like I had left a little in the tank, but I was more than happy with the result. Two weeks later, I decided to try a 10k (again on the track) and held a pace just above 6min/mi for a time of 37:43. 

&amp;#x200B;

I intend on running my first official marathon in Napa Valley, USA in March which has a negative net elevation and seems like a PR friendly course. Originally, I thought that based on my April marathon I would attempt to stick to 7:20/mi pace, but after these last two efforts, I feel like I may be selling myself short? To give a little more perspective, I ran a 23mi long run yesterday at 7:53/mi (stupid and unnecessarily long for a training run, I know) with my HR in zone 2 for 80% of the run. My ultimate goal is to qualify for Boston which seems to require something like 2:52:00 for my age group. 

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely don't expect to run that fast anytime soon but would a sub-3 outing my first time out be unrealistic? I see people in this sub with slower 5k/10k times who have comfortably cracked 3 hours so that seems pretty encouraging to me. The Jack Daniels training calculator estimates a 2:54 marathon time based on my 10k PR, but that sounds ambitious as hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I've built up a lot of faith in my body/legs and believe that with more consistency, I can achieve a lot more. I sort of have a chip on my shoulder after years of squandered potential smoking weed and wasting time. I quit cross country in high school after making varsity Freshman year, and the memory of that brings me a lot of shame. I recently looked up the collegiate times of my former teammates who I was naturally faster than back then, and they set PRs in the sub 15min range for 5k and sub 32min for 10k. I know this probably sounds dramatic, but I'm on a personal mission to make the most of the waning years of my youth.",1627353087

I'm a former powerlifter with a few years of decent running experience behind me. My running has improved drastically but looking back it's pretty pathetic for the amount of work I've put in. For example i hit a 19:16 5km 3 years ago running just 25km a week with a heavy emphasis on speed. I Pb'd about 6 months ago with 18:16, i went for a 5km today and hit 20 minutes. I weigh less and have ran substantial blocks of training with anywhere from 70km&gt;120km a week. I run every day and stress about this a lot. The amount of work I put in feels incredible and to regress is so de-motivating. 

I have tried a mixture of high mileage/easy miles ect...and am a bit lost on what to do now. The general advice i read on here is ""do more easy miles"" but i've done that! I mix up easy runs with threshold runs and then speed work, my program ""seems"" to be pretty good. I've read marathon training and jack daniels formula. i just don't know where i'm going wrong.

The outlying factors for me (compared to the average distance runner)

1 - i weigh about 200lb (this is mostly muscle, i used to train for bodybuilding/powerlifting for 10 years)

2- I still train with reasonably heavy weights (probably a 500lb squat, 400 bench and 550 deadlift). This likely adds to my fatigue

Based on the above info what are your initial thoughts? My mental health isn't great with this to be honest, all i do is think about running and training. When you try so hard (run every day/doubles alongside weights and regress it's hard to take.

This will be my first time trying Pfitz AND my first ever marathon. My goal is to run sub-3, and I know I have the speed, but I need some more endurance. I was preparing for 18/70 last month, but I got sick (not covid) and even after I got better, training has fallen off because of work, vacation, and laziness.

I tried the first week and the HM pace run was on a very hot day in the sun, and I just couldn’t do it.

Some background about me, I started running again last year after not running regularly for about 5 years (I ran track and cross country in high school). I have since built up to running about 40 miles per week (with a down week of 20-25 mpw every 4th week). Truth be told, I haven't really been doing a lot of workouts or speed work. Every so often (1-2 times per month) I'll run at a medium effort for 3-5 miles (which for me is about 7:15-7:30 pace), but all of my other runs I do at an easy effort (usually 8:45 - 9:15 pace). I do, however, live in a pretty hilly area, so my easy runs on flatter surfaces are usually around 8:20 - 8:45 pace.

A couple of months ago I ran my very first half marathon. I didn't follow a training plan or anything (just the training I mentioned above). I ran it in 1:38. Miles 3-6 of the race were on this really uneven trail with a lot of big rocks and roots, so that made my legs burn like crazy. There was one steep hill after that portion, but the rest of the course overall was pretty flat.

Given those circumstances, I'm curious as to how much time I'm capable of dropping. I know the only way to find out is to continue running and give it time, but I'm curious as to what you all would predict. I would love to run under 1:30 one day. Do you all think that is possible?",1627265554

Hoping I am using the correct flair and in the proper subreddit for this type of question :)

I started running in August 2020.

I've done a 5k, 10k, and half marathon (end of May2021) all solo.

During this time, I've picked up a Garmin watch, handheld 18oz bottle, and a Nathan 5k belt that held my phone. 

The belt has now started to tear so I am possibly looking for a pack/vest to accommodate the longer miles I will be running in the future months. 

I have recently been running about 15-20miles a week, and will be picking that up as I am training for a couple half marathons in Sept/Oct.

I am looking for a pack/vest that holds \~50oz, that way I don't have to rely on family during my training. 

A big requirement for the vest/pack is its able to hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

I came across this training plan from Runnersworld and gave it a try for the last three weeks. My aim was to run either a 3:45 or 3:30 marathon. However, I now start to doubt  this training plan is actually any good. 

First of all it looks like that the easy runs does not match up with their description of an easy run. In the plan you would be running 10min/mile, while the actual pace should be half a minute slower than your marathon pace, so 9min/mile. 

For the long runs it's the same story running above 9min/mile while 9 min/mile should be the speed.

AdvancedRunning,Wolverines_Nan,5k Progression and some tips I've picked up on the journey.,"A mix of a race report and some tips I wanted to spread:  


I'm 29m and 6 years ago I ran my first 5k race at a Parkrun in 22:39.  
I'd already been training for about 6 months for it but was 23 and had never run before that other than to catch a bus. My girlfriend's dad ran a 16 min 5k that I thought was superhuman and I had it in my head that you had to run as a kid/ teenager to reach sub 17 territory. 

6 years later, I just ran a road 5k race in 15:35! 

So the first thing I wanted to say is that you don't have to be running as a kid to reach those sort of times. You just have to stick with the training for a long time.  
It's amazing how much our bodies can grow and adapt!

I do intervals once a week, workouts like 6 x 1200 with 200 jog recoveries, 800's at target 5k pace with 200 recovery as my favourites, occasional hill sessions and a 5 mile tempo run every few weeks with a long run on weekends ranging from 13 to 20 miles (Mostly 20 miles).  
I would speculate though that more than the specific workouts, it's consistency, weekly miles and running over time that's where the improvements have come.   
I was running about 35 miles a week to manage 18:50 5k's. I was still doing the workouts and intervals but done my easy runs a lot faster in comparison to my race pace than I do now. (Easy runs were about 7:45-7:25 pace looking at my Strava while nowadays they're about 7:40 to 7 min pace).  
That's probably why I used to get injured so much. I've had ITB injuries putting me out for 4 or 5 months at some stages, sciatic pain that put me out for an entire summer and all sorts of ankle pains and niggles. I used to pay for physios, foam roll and all that stuff but I found if I got the same injury twice, both times I'd recover in the same amount of time, whether I got sport massages and ultrasound things that are supposed to get more blood to the muscles or if I just rested and did nothing.  
So nowadays if I get a niggle, I just rest for a few days. I think listening to your body is something that you learn over time. I read in a running science book that the reason behind a lot of injuries is that our muscles recover and grow quicker than our tendons and the tendons are the bits that get the typical injuries. So after upping your milage or training, your muscles feel like they can handle it and are doing fine but your tendons haven't kept up and get injured. So the point I got from that is to remember even if your muscles are feeling great after upping your training load, you don't know how far behind your tendons are so give them a rest.

I was hovering around 60 miles a week to go sub 17 and also run a 2:51 marathon.  
Now I'm more around 70 miles a week with some weeks at 85.   
I used to take rest days once or twice a week but I can handle a lot more now and work in months rather than weeks, so I'll have 3 weeks intense and then a recovery week of a few rest days and only about 50 miles and find that really works well for me.

Some other weird tips I've picked up are things like getting the maximum boost out of caffeine.   
So I read that our bodies grow stronger tolerances to substances like caffeine, where if we take it all the time, we don't get as much of a hit from it. Google told me it takes 2 weeks to lose the tolerance so if I've got a big race on, I'll completely avoid caffeine for 2 weeks (You have to watch out for chocolates and drinks that sneak it in) so when I take an energy gel an hour before a race, I get a massive rush, like my head's blasting off my body.

I know a lot of people that take beetroot shots before a race as well for the boost it gives but you can get a bigger boost if you take it for the whole week of the race. I drink a glass of beetroot juice every night; you get used to the taste over time.

I've found that to get quicker, you just have to devote more of your life to running. When I started, it'd just be half hour to an hour a few nights a week, building to an hour every night and now a point where the runs are an hour and a half but then you have half hour of strength training 2 or 3 nights a week, doing squats, hip thrusts and calf raises, time to prepare proper food (Which you should do anyway I guess, even not running) and 9 hours of sleep a night where I used to not bother about how long I slept. Basically running is like anything, where the more time you put into it, the better you'll get and there are no cheats or ways around that. 

So I think the best lesson I've worked out for improving running and maybe any hobby is to give it time, and the more time you devote to it, the better you'll get. Just stick with the training and it takes years to really improve, not months like I used to think.

Hope this helps to buy someone an extra few seconds in an upcoming race!",1627217166

AdvancedRunning,CrazyLegzDT,Running &amp; Keto,"So to preface, I've just picked up running again about a year ago, after a long layoff, and I've been doing a pretty solid keto diet for almost 6 months. I've got more energy than I ever have and my training is going extremely well.

I see a lot of advice on this forum and online in general about ""carbing up"" and replacing carbs post run. This isn't  new to me, I ran XC in high school and would always load up on pasta the night before a race.

This is an obvious contradiction though, and while I do intake some carbs, naturally through some sugars and starch, I definitely don't go out of my way to overload on carbs anymore. No pasta, no bread, no fast food, limited starch, low calorie/sugar sport drinks and grapes to refuel, a little CBD to take the edge off.

Is anyone else a keto-runner? Are there some positives or negatives? Anyone have any studies they could share in this regard? I guess I'm fishing for some research articles/personal experiences about this topic. I know sugar and glucose is the first thing to go but without having a ton of that in my system and running on ketones, how long can I realistically last? Is a ""keto marathon"" a possibility? Are there specific gel packs for keto runners? Should I still carb load before a race? My transition from glucose to ketones is working well during exercise (I think? 🤔, Lol).

I did a 15 mile run this morning and haven't had any solid carbs in about 2 weeks... Felt great, ran about 8:30 pace and finished really strong. I know there's a ""personal"" aspect to this but would you think my wall is coming soon after 15 miles? I see the majority of marathoners say around 20 or 22 is when they hit the wall.

Any advice, suggestions, comments would be appreciated. Thanks all!",1627152172

AdvancedRunning,NBeeLange,Big Toe Injury Experience,"Just a little background: I am a 29yo male who has been active my whole life. I love long distance hiking, rock climbing, and just being highly active. For the past year and a half I’ve taken a serious liking to running. I primarily run on trails, with eventual goals of mountain/ultra running in the future, gradually increasing my max distance, basically expanding on my biggest hobby of hiking. I have worked my way up to the point where I could comfortably run 30-35 miles per week, with the majority of it being on trails with a good amount of vertical (usually aim for 200ft/mile). As of now my longest run had been a 16.5mi trail run, and my current goal is a 30mi run through the NH mountains.

Around March I started dealing with some shin pain. I continued to run through it, however it continued getting worse as I continued to do nothing (as expected). By May I had to cut a 5mi slow recovery run short and walk home due to the pain. At this point I decided to take a month off for rest and re-evaluate. 

After the month off I felt great, and got back into a 15-20 mile/week schedule, avoiding road runs altogether. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, the pain was back nearly as bad as it was previously. At this point I went to PT to try and see mechanically if I was doing anything wrong. This is where I found out that I had a serious lack of mobility in my right big toe, and they believe the lack of mobility is causing a large amount of stress to be “relocated” to my lower leg. This was confirmed even more recently when I went to an Orthopedic surgeon for a true diagnosis. It was found that I possibly have some arthritis in my right big toe, as well as “hallux limitus” (in other words, limited mobility due to the reduced cartilage).

This was an absolute blow to me. I am going to see more specialists to try to get a solid plan of action, but something like this was completely unexpected. As of right now I am basically feeling as though my long term goals are shot, as my body simply won’t allow it. 

A part of me feels like I am overreacting, but movement is basically my whole life. Does anyone have any experience with this type of injury/ailment? I would love some first-hand info. Will I basically be limited the rest of my life?",1627138988

&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; **Background:** Recent studies in rodents indicate that a combination of exercise training and supplementation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors has synergistic effects. However, there are currently no human clinical trials analyzing this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Objective:** This study investigates the effects of a combination of exercise training and supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the immediate precursor of NAD+, on cardiovascular fitness in healthy amateur runners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Methods:** A six-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm clinical trial including 48 young and middle-aged recreationally trained runners of the Guangzhou Pearl River running team was conducted. The participants were randomized into four groups: the low dosage group (300 mg/day NMN), the medium dosage group (600 mg/day NMN), the high dosage group (1200 mg/day NMN), and the control group (placebo). Each group consisted of ten male participants and two female participants. Each training session was 40-60 min, and the runners trained 5-6 times each week. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed at baseline and after the intervention, at 6 weeks, to assess the aerobic capacity of the runners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Analysis of covariance of the change from baseline over the 6 week treatment showed that the oxygen uptake (VO2), percentages of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), power at first ventilatory threshold, and power at second ventilatory threshold increased to a higher degree in the medium and high dosage groups compared with the control group. However, there was no difference in VO2max, O2-pulse, VO2  related to work rate, and peak power after the 6 week treatment from baseline in any of these groups.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusion:** NMN increases the aerobic capacity of humans during exercise training, and the improvement is likely the result of enhanced O2  utilization of the skeletal muscle.

AdvancedRunning,cnyyck,"Paid for Lactate Threshold testing at sports facility, thrown off by results.","Hi all, I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could help me make sense of these lactate threshold test results. Paid to get the test done at a local sports clinic. Seems my lactate levels spiked but then went down afterwards, is that normal?
https://imgur.com/ltsNUwN

Lactate gets up to 7.4 at heart rate of 162, which seems very low to me. For reference, I'm 27M, run my easy miles up to HRs of 153-155 and am conversational at that pace. The tester goes on to do 3 more intervals of 3 minutes with slight increases in speed, all of which show the lactate levels to be from 1.7-2.9 meaning they dropped back down from the initial spike. The way they explained it to me is that after I hit my threshold my body began to flush the lactate. Isn't Lactate Threshold by definition the point at which your blood begins to accumulate lactate at a faster rate than it can get rid of it? Please help me interpret this. Thanks.",1627076800
AdvancedRunning,Humanoid-v1,How much can lactate threshold pace improve over time?,"Consider an ideal scenario in which a runner builds up mileage consistently without injury over a number of years from a base of 30mpw to 80+ mpw, and does the usual LT workouts and long runs as prescribed in any distance running training plan.

It should depend on initial conditions, i.e. improvement starting from 8min/mi should be more than improvement from 6min/mi.

AdvancedRunning,GGusernameperson1,"Returning to running after long break, how should I adjust my training volume?","Currently a high school junior (17M). I did cross country and long/mid distance track in freshman year but wasn’t able to do these last year due to covid so I had to run on my own. Unfortunately I was extremely inconsistent and often went entire months without doing a run.

I’m starting to run again and I’m wondering how high my training volume should be. Most of my cardiovascular endurance is gone, but I’m assuming that since I consistently ran at some point that my muscles and tendons are still able to take on more load than someone who hasn’t run before.

As a side note, I’d also like to ask if it’ll be easier to regain my cardiovascular fitness than it was to initially gain it, or if it’ll take just as long with just as much training. 

Is it safe for me to increase my training volume faster than a beginner would up until it matches my old training volume? Or should it be increased at a similar pace due to how long my break from running has been?

Other information to note while answering: 

My previous peak MPW during cross country was roughly 25-36 miles per week. Unfortunately I don’t know the exact number.
Current pace: 10min/mile
Previous 5K PR: 23:27
Previous mile PR: 6:36

The kidney stabbed every time I shifted my body to the left.

The doc has me scheduled for an ultrasound, X-ray, bloodwork and another urine test next week, but given how the pain is localized to one area and not clearing up on antibiotics I’m inclined to believe it’s a kidney stone.

AdvancedRunning,Humanoid-v1,"Does everyone hit a ""wall"" in a marathon?","In the two marathons I've ran, I've hit a wall by the 20-23 mile mark whereby either my legs feel significantly heavier (i.e. harder to maintain a regular stride length) or I have to slow down significantly to avoid cramping (e.g., from 7:10min/mile to over 9min/mile). To use physics jargon, there's an obvious ""phase transition"": one minute I'm feeling completely fine, then the next my legs are crashing. Physiologically, I guess this is due to glycogen depletion, like a gas tank going from non-empty to empty, which forces the body to switch to metabolizing fat, which is much less efficient. (I did take enough fluids and nutrition during the races: 5 clif gels, with water/electrolytes handed out along the course). However, looking at some of the race reports here, I often see people post marathon splits that are almost constant all the way up to the 26.2. So I'm wondering whether everyone will hit a wall in some form at their marathon pace and just have to learn to run through it with sheer mental fortitude, or whether one can avoid the wall completely with sufficient training?

To give some context, I ran both of these races with insufficient preparation: my training maxed out at 35mpw, I had injuries (stress reaction) that forced me to stop training almost entirely in the 5 weeks leading up to race day. Also, I was sleep deprived the week before one race due to caring for a family member at a hospital. Maybe it's all these circumstances that led to the wall, not that the wall is inevitable.

Somewhat related, it seems the issue doesn't appear in half marathons. In a recent HM where I also ran with barely any training (&lt; 10mpw), I could hold 6:35min/mile for the 13.1 and only felt limited by my lactate threshold and respiratory limits when I tried to speed up near the end. Whereas I can't even hold 7:10min/mile for 26.2.

Any tips on how to improve my trail running training? I'm looking for anything--pacing, where to look, footwear--anything. Thanks!",1626973051
AdvancedRunning,thaquestion,Hood to Coast Question(s),"We've got a team headed out at the end of August for HTC this year.  Looking at past results, we'd like to finish in the top 3 in our division and are pretty confident that is viable with current fitness.  We've won a few other relays in the past, but this is obviously a different animal.  


We've recently heard some different things from some runners that have competed on teams that have taken a more casual approach, and these things have caused a bit of concern, so I figured I would jump in here and ask some questions, as I'm sure there are some in here that have taken a more competitive approach to the race.  


The major question surrounds exchanges.  How bad are they, and are did you find yourselves in situations where you couldn't get to the next exchange in time?  If that situation did occur, we're you able to work around it?  I know that there is a rule about dropping runners off within 500ft of an exchange, but, let's say traffic was stopped a half-mile out, would it be wise to drop your runner off there and let them warm-up over that 800m?  Did you use vehicles over and above your vans to leap frog runners?  I've read the handbook, and I know there are a ton of rules around vans, so I'm not sure this is even legal, and I want to make sure we follow the rules explicitly.  


In your experience, does HTC start like other relay races with the fastest teams going off last (we've heard otherwise)?  Do things typically bunch up in the middle of the race as they do in other races? 

Were there any other situations that you would recommend we be aware of?  


Appreciate any feedback in advance and look forward to seeing anyone who's going to be out there.",1626970654
AdvancedRunning,ER24,Looking for advice on safely returning from a quad strain,"I strained my right quad on June 25th from overtraining. It was fairly mild, I was still able to walk, and didn't have any pain at all within two days or so. I took 12 days off while doing mild stretching, body weight squats, and light band work. After returning I did three short (2.5-3.5mile) slow runs on three consecutive days. I felt completely fine, took a rest day on the 4th day, then did 3.5 on the 5th day and 5 on the 6th day. After the 5 mile run, I did feel some discomfort (2/10) and decided to take 1 more week off. The week was up today and I did a very slow 2.5 mile run. Felt completely fine during the run, but I feel a bit of tension in my quad around 4 hours post-run if I plant my foot in a certain way. It isn't constant. 

It's now been 27 days since the initial injury. I was planning on doing 3 runs this week with rest days in between each, but I'm slightly off put by the fact that I do feel 'something' in my quad after today's run. Is there a point where discomfort is normal when starting to run again after injury, or should things essentially be 100%? Is there anything other than stretching and band work that I should be doing? I do go to the gym, and I have done some light leg work (squats, leg extensions, hamstring curls, leg press) and felt completely fine after that.

AdvancedRunning,Ethnadar,Looking for guidance injury prevention from intense workload -,"Transfer post from r/running (sorry I'm not the most skilled with Reddit)

Background: 18 y/o M running about 35-40 MPW usually around 7:30 pace, but goes closer to 6:30 pace on workout days. It has been this way the entire summer. My current training plan that I am on is a slow buildup into my season where I am expected to be around 16:40, but I want to be much quicker.

Alright so let me start things out with the goal, in about 3 months is the state qualifying/state cross country meet, and my goal is to win state, which for my class, is around 16 flat. Currently, my PR is a 17:30, which was enough for me to qualify as a sophomore, but due to an injury from over training my junior year, I failed to make it past districts. As you can imagine, this was one of the most humiliating moments of my life, as the district meet was held in my hometown, and all of my friends and family watched as the star runner of the town failed to make state in front of them.

I came out of that season with a burning sense of motivation, and I decided I was going to win state no matter what. Over the last few months I have visited extra coaches, with expensive training plans, but I still don't feel like it is enough. I've tried changing how I breathed (nose-only to limit air intake, therefore making my lungs more efficient) and even considered buying a weighted vest, just to get stronger. I have set up tape around my school's entire track at specific spots that at the right cadence, will set me up for around a 4 min mile pace (for speed work). However, with the little amount I feel I have done \~30 miles/week. I still can feel myself getting injured, I can feel that even now I have brought on some runners knee, even sitting down to type this is making my knees ache, even so, I know that this is the LEAST I will be training over the next few months - no matter the pain that I will go through, as long as it makes me believe I am getting stronger.

The main goal here is to get as fast as I can without getting injured, but I know my body is not able to handle the same load my mind can, and I know for certain that this season will go either 1 of 2 ways, I get injured, and it is a repeat of my failure last year, or I am state champion.

I'm willing to put in the work, I will do anything, but there is only so much my body can handle compared to my mind. I do practice good warm ups and cool downs, ice, and stretches. It makes me so frustrated that I don't think I can reach my goal over something so unfair as an injury. I've been eating much better and getting close to 120 g of protein a day, so I must know, is there ANYTHING that can help me to reach my goal and prevent me from destroying my knees? No matter how the season goes, I would rather train too hard and get hurt, than train too little, and not redeem myself.

Any help is great help. BE AS BRUTAL AS YOU WANT.

TL;DR : I want to train harder, but also avoid getting injured.",1626936817

AdvancedRunning,the_el_tortuga,Where should I set my expectations for the fall?,"Here’s the deal: I have sort of an unusual story with the sport &amp; as a result I have no idea what expectations are realistic when a (generally) post-COVID world arrives and I start racing regularly this fall.  

I started running in early September of 2019 as a college sophomore (then a 19 y.o. male), training for a half marathon.  I managed 1 flat mile in 8:51, and I nearly passed out at the end.  At that point I hadn’t played a sport since JV boy’s volleyball, and my only conditioning was some occasional rock climbing/backpacking.  

Ran my first half solo in May 2020 &amp; barely managed a 2:15.  Trained all summer &amp; by the fall I was consistently putting in 30-45 mpw.   Lowered my half PR to 1:53 that December.   In spring 2021 I set my sights on the 5k but - despite consistent weekly milage between 30-50 w/ two workouts &amp; a long run each week, I couldn’t drop my 5k PR lower than a 22:27 (though it’s worth noting I never really got to taper for a race).  

This summer I’m running 6-7 days a week, on track to average 40-60 mpw, and I feel good despite working a job on my feet and an icky VA summer.  I’m doing 1 hard workout + a long run every week.  Easy pace somewhere between 8:30-9:30, based on the heat. 

This fall, I’ll get to run my first-ever (NIRCA) XC season.  I’ll be a 21 year old male with some solid milage under my belt, and I’d love to break 20 in the 5k.  Is this an attainable goal?  If not, what seems more reasonable?  I’m not afraid to work my ass off, I just have no real reference point for what to expect.

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is Squires Long Run**.

*History:*

This series of long run workouts was created by Bill Squires, legendary coach of the Greater Boston Track Club (of which Bill Rodgers was a member). These workouts were designed to simulate the latter stages of a marathon.

*What:*

Insert a number of surges right smack in the middle of your long runs. Squires suggests surging for anywhere from 30 seconds to 12 minutes—the shorter the surge, the faster the pace.

*How:*

Pretty simple. *Competitor* recommends inserting a bit of structure to the surges. Here's their example over a 10-week period (final Squires Long Run is 3 weeks out from the marathon):

* Week 1: 15:00 easy, 6 x [2:00 surge @ 5K effort/8:00 easy], 15:00 easy [90 minutes total]

* Week 3: 25:00 easy, 6 x [4:00 surge @ 10K effort/6:00 easy], 25:00 easy [1 hour, 50 minutes total]

* Week 5: 35:00 easy, 6 x [6:00 surge @ half marathon effort/4:00 easy], 35:00 easy [2 hours, 10 minutes total]

* Week 7: 45:00 easy, 6 x [8:00 surge @ marathon effort/2:00 easy], 45:00 easy [2 hours, 10 minutes total]

M, 27, 65-70MPW. 11 Weeks out from first Sub3 marathon attempt. Previous PBs 1:24 HM, 37.29 10k, 17:39 5k (Time trial not official).

For example for the next 2 weeks my sessions are 8x1k at around 5k pace and week after is 5x1 mile trying to match pace. Reasoning behind prescribing these kind of sessions is to improve lactate threshold and get used to running harder than marathon pace. 

Should I be looking to increase the volume of these sessions over the next couple of weeks maybe more aimed at HM pace for example 4x2 miles, 4x3 miles etc or is it good to maintain the kind of intensity.

AdvancedRunning,knandraina,Training Marathon,"Hello team,

I hope you are doing well. I plan to run a marathon next year (it will be my first time). I've started to run at the beginning of the year. I have been mainly running small distances (5k). 

Since mid-April 2021, I decided to buy a watch, a Polar Vantage V2, to see how I improve myself. While it is not 100% accurate, it gives me a rough idea of where I am.

A few days ago, I did a test to calculate my max heart rate. It is at 188bpm. Then I applied my different heart zone.  
Zone 1: 119-132 ;  
Zone 2: 133-146;   
Zone 3: 146-159;  
Zone 4: 160-173;  
Zone 5 : &gt; 173

Then I started to do my training in the city I lived. It is pretty flat, and I ran in Zone 2 between 5.30min/km to 6.15min/km. I had a really high (between 61 to 65) Index Running. While I know I shouldn't follow it religiously I like to see how I evolve over the long term through it.

Then I moved out from my little city, and now I live in a city where there are uphills. Indeed, it is not possible to only run on a flat surface. While I like it, if I want to stay in zone 2, I need to walk. A lot. Yesterday I did a run,10k at 6.30min/km, with a lot of walking when there were big uphills.

Of course, my Index Running is far lower than what it used to be (53).

Here are my questions, is it still relevant to stay in zone 2? Should I adjust my zone 2? I know there are multiple modes to do training with polar:

* Running
* Trail Running

Should I leverage Trail Running? Indeed, I also run on loose terrain like dirt, gravel...",1626858440

**Training (Or Lack Thereof)**

I recently have gotten back into running seriously in the past two or three months. After completing my first half marathon in April 2020, I have been dealing with some personal issues relating to various factors within my life. Ultimately, I started running “full-time” again around the middle of May 2021 after taking almost four months completely off. With that being said, I am slowly building up my mileage again but only averaging roughly 20 miles a week currently. I have ran two Spartan Races recently, one Sprint and one Super, which is a completely different topic. Overall, I truly feel that my overall fitness is surprisingly not only coming back relatively quickly, but even surpassing my previous levels both physically and mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Race**

This decision to try to run a sub twenty-minute 5K was extremely spontaneous as I thought about attempting this feat the evening prior to my birthday. As my Spartan Super was on July 10th, I still had a few battle scars from that event and only ran two and half miles on Tuesday since then as active recovery. I seriously had no plans or preparation in regards to this random event.

I have a superstition that requires me to have a bowl of honey nut cheerios the night before anything that will test my physical capabilities ever since I aced my AFROTC Physical Fitness Assessment. Before going to bed, I decided to calculate the average pace I would have to run at and determined I would aim for a 6:30 minute per mile pace for the three miles and hope to get the last tenth of a mile in under 30 seconds to just barely achieve a sub 20 and have my watch read 19.XX. I determined that I would complete this around a loop that contains my local municipal building which is shockingly half of a mile exactly. This meant that I would aim to complete each lap under 3:15 if I wanted to have a chance at this random and ambitious goal.

I woke up the following morning around 6:30 to stretch, roll out, and simply hype myself up. I had some watermelon around 7:30 as I strongly dislike eating or drinking anything in the morning but figured I should get some fuel in me. I headed to my selected course around 8:00 with my father who so kindly agreed to wake up early and come time me. Although I do use his ancient Garmin Forerunner 310XT, I wanted someone there to not only cheer me on, but mainly to keep track of the time in case something went wrong. Nonetheless, I was so thrilled that he came out as I am so thankful for all of the support he has provided, especially this past year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Race**

I completed a few dynamic stretches and walked/jogged a quarter mile at most. This is one thing I need to work on in the future as I rarely warm up for any activity that I do as I always run immediately in the morning. Anyways, once I felt ready enough, I stripped down into just my running socks, my well-worn pair of Hoka Clifton 6, and a new pair of silkies which I wore for the first time as I wanted to feel like a true runner again. I counted down with my father so that my watch and his stopwatch would be fairly accurate and off I went.

To say that I started off too fast would be a major understatement. I have not completed any speedwork in months, or ever, and I truly have never trained specifically for faster paces. I completed the first lap or half mile in 2:48.56. I was unaware of how fast I was running as I am trying to break a bad habit of constantly looking at my watch and pace. I felt great so I assumed I was running around my target pace despite never being able to truly recognize my pace.

When my watch buzzed after completing lap two, I glanced down at my watch to see that I just ran a sub 6-minute mile. Not to get too sidetracked as I am sure this post is already extremely long, I honestly cannot tell you if I have ever run a sub 6-minute mile, let alone the 5:50.1 that I just ran for the first mile of this 5K. Later that day, my father mentioned that after the first mile he was so worried that I was not going to even finish another lap as I went out way too fast.

At this point, I made a serious and conscious effort to try to slow down as the adrenaline definitely carried me through that first mile. I knew deep down that if I continued at this pace that I was going to crash hard. The next two laps went by extremely quick, but towards the end of the fourth lap and into the fifth, it became the mental game.

My body surprisingly felt fine besides my knee which was slightly sore from a major abrasion that I collected the previous weekend. My mind kept telling me that I had plenty of time left to spare so I can just slow down. I was luckily able to fight through these thoughts of stopping as I knew I would be extremely disappointed in myself if I did not give this birthday run my best effort. I knew that I slowed down slightly from my watch and my father yelling my lap times, but I felt confident that if I continued this pace, 19.XX might be doable. Breaking twenty was a goal that I have been trying to accomplish for a while prior to my year long hiatus from running.

After the fifth lap, I dug deep to continue my current pace while saving enough energy for that final stretch. As soon as I came around the bend and my watched vibrated to alert my third mile, I began to sprint towards my father who moved down towards my estimated finish line. Once I reached him, I looked down at my watch to check my distance and I purposely avoided looking at the time to not psych myself out. I still had about 0.05 of a mile to go and I practically closed my eyes and ran as hard as I could to try to secure my 19.XX time. I glazed back down at my watch about fifteen seconds later and stopped my watch once I made sure it read 3.10 miles. I was in disbelief and I thought for sure that I miscalculated the course or that my Garmin did not accurately track my run. My watch did not read my reach goal of 19.XX but something that I would not have dreamed of. Not only did I run sub twenty, I shaved over a minute off of my PR. Once my father convinced me that I did in fact run the proper distance, I was simple speechless. I was incredibly nervous when I decided the night before to attempt to break twenty minutes as I knew that I would be extremely disappointed when I did not break twenty minutes. To not only break twenty minutes, but to surpass my goal by an entire minute was extremely surreal to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-Race**

Feeling the best I have in quite some time, my cooldown consisted of pacing the last tenth of a mile numerous times as I called my brother and soaked in this overwhelmingly positive high moment. It was bittersweet as I was hoping to get 19.XX on my 19th birthday for the effect. In reality, it still has not set in yet as sub nineteen was unimaginable and I did not even consider a possibility of achieving this even within the next year. I went home with my father and grabbed a quick shower before celebrating the rest of my birthday. I went with my father and my brother and tried my first Playa Bowl as I have heard so much hype about them. I was not disappointed as it was also the perfect victory and recovery meal. The rest of the day I was on this incredible high feeling as the result still is extremely surreal which made my 19th birthday amazing.

**Future Goals**

I have missed running so much over this past year that I want to get back into it while putting my mental health as a major priority. I need to focus on the sustainability aspects of running and learn to run slow and truly enjoy the privilege that is running. This proved that my break to focus on my mental health was extremely important and definitely worth it as my life has completely changed and I feel unconditionally better in all aspects of my life.

For specific goals, I plan on earning my Spartan Trifecta by completing a Spartan Beast in October which is a half marathon distance. I also want to improve my 1.5-mile time for AFROTC by being able to comfortably max out the run time which is 9:12 or below. After the fall, I plan on focusing on longer distances either with a sub 1:30 half or my first marathon.

Ultimately, I will continue to build up my mileage while finalizing a few of my remaining personal issues and focus on my mental health as I have missed running greatly. I am hopeful that I will be able to reach any goal I create for myself with this new mindset as I never imagined I would have been this mentally and physically “healthy” and I am finally truly proud of myself!

Thank you all for reading my first race report and for all of the support!

AdvancedRunning,kyleyle,"Training tips, criticism, and advice?","**Stats:** 5'3 \[M\], 22 years old

**Upcoming race:** my first (virtual) marathon in late August

**Previous experience:** none, excluding an athletic background of competitive swimming and powerlifting

**Notes:** I started running in March 2020 and ran for the summer months. I began to experience IT band syndrome in June and the pain became very limiting in August of that year. I reached a peak of 40-50 km/week and accomplished a 2:08 half marathon but with severe pain. I went back to powerlifting and began running again in April 2021 and had a goal of racing in my city's marathon while completing my training injury-free. My ultimate goal is to run a BQ and race in marathons internationally.

My current peak and times are:

* \~105 km/week
   * the longest run of 32 km
* 10k: 49:51
* 21.1k: 1:47:38

The listed times were run at about 75% effort. My usual training pace is 5:10/km, and I am continuing with my lifting but at a decreased load (5x/week).

I haven't read any books by Daniels or Pfitz but I knew enough from browsing and combined with my swimming experience to slowly ride the peak up and increase my long runs marginally every week. I am also familiar that not every run must be a PB, and that the majority of runs are at a comfortable, steady pace.

**Question:** Where and how would you see me improving? Is my mileage too high for my experience? I haven't had any injuries since I've started again this year and I've improved my recovery with a better warmup/cooldown, and stretching and foam rolling. Thoughts on how I may perform in the marathon? Cheers",1626729295

I was invited to run a 2 mile out and back road race with a gnarly hill to begin &amp; end at the 0.2 and 1.8 markers and a tight hairpin turnaround at the one mile mark . I have never run a race at this short of a distance so curious what the best way is to warm-up, what my race strategy should be, how to attack (?) the hairpin, and effort for the uphill and downhill. I am currently running a 5:4x one mile right now since I have not put effort into a short distance race this year, and planning to run in Next% since those are the only flats I own (not sure if that matters for the 180 turn?).",1626726010

I’m going to take a crack at a 1500 in a little under two weeks and honestly have no idea what to expect or aim for given I have never run one. I am guessing I will be running alone but that could change depending on who enters in the next 12 days which makes pacing all the more important.

I am curious what kind of training led you folks to the times in the title. I am training for the 5k at the moment so haven’t done any real mile specific sessions to post but was on the track doing some faster stuff the last few weeks and wanted to compare as much as possible to what other people have done to get a reasonable picture of fitness.

Some general info:
* Last 8 weeks averaged 62 miles/week on 7 days of singles
* 15:23 5k PR from last cycle. Other PRs are worse and for longer distances.
* Easy miles 7:10-7:30. 
* 36 years old. Definitely more of a speedster.
* 12-14 x 100m once a week in 12 high-14 mid w/ jog in.

Last 5 sessions:
* 10 @ easy tempo avg. 5:48 (7/4)
* 12x400 @  goal 5k w/ 200 jog avg. 71.4 (7/7)
* 8 @ aerobic tempo avg 5:38 (7/11)
* 3x1000m/200m w/ 200 jog between the 1000 &amp; 200 and 4’ between sets. Then a 600/200 w/ 200 jog between. 2:55/31,2:54/31,2:57/32,1:42/29 (7/14)

AdvancedRunning,Hooch_Pandersnatch,Questions about Strength training,"My upcoming goal marathon is at the end of August, after which I’m planning to take a relative down period to help reset me physically and mentally.

During this time I’d like to implement some more strength work to help with injury mitigation and hopefully build up some more fast twitch muscle fibers in the legs too. I’d still like to run during this time, but more focused on shorter distance rather than marathoning (I’ve been averaging 70 MPW with plenty of tempo and threshold level efforts during this current training block; during the down time, I’d like to dial it back to maybe 30-35 MPW focusing more on 5k specific workouts).

Some questions:
1) I was looking at strength programs. I see Stronglifts 5x5 recommended a lot (both on this forum and others) but are there better lifting programs mor specialized towards runners? e.g. I’m not sure how stuff like the bench press or overhead press will really relate to running (given my limited lifting knowledge)

2) Is it realistic to do both a strength training program (maybe 4x weekly) along with 2-3 5k specific workouts each week? 5k workouts being things like 800m repeats. Because I’m planning to cut back mileage drastically, I was hoping to somewhat mitigate the lack of total miles with more intense efforts. But I’m not sure if the added lifting will be too much for me to also handle 2-3 track workouts each week in parallel.",1626701053

Before anyone says it, Yes. I’m aware of the rules of this subreddit and no I’m not looking for a medical diagnosis. I have already seen both physical therapy and a doctor to receive both an examination and MRI, both of which haven’t been helpful. The MRI came back with nothing and my doctor (Orthopedic) said he doesn’t know what’s wrong either…

Hence, I wanted to reach out here to ask if anyone had experienced this similar issue and give some tips and tricks into things they did or people they went to see for help.

As for the specifics, I have reoccurring pain beneath or “behind” the knee. It’s not sharp pain but it’s uncomfortable enough that it can prevent me from running. The inside facing side of my knee is sensitive to press on, yet the bottom doesn’t hurt to touch (where the pain comes from). It almost feels like a tight tendon is pulling on my knee. Curling my leg back, all the way, feels strange as well as extending my entire leg. Going into a hamstring stretch is nearly impossible on the effected leg. The real pain and or discomfort comes from pushing off the ground and walking up/down stairs.

This suddenly comes and goes during my training but this time it’s quite bad preventing me from running all together. There’s no warning signs as it just appears after any given run. Yesterday I did an easy 9mi and now I can’t run on it at all…

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,My achilles story/rant,"Hi, I'm currently doing summer training for college cross country, and it has been going well for the most part, aside from stupid achilles injuries. Up until this point, I had been basically injury free. 

In February 2021, I did damage to my left achilles. It killed whenever I wore a shoe with a closed back. I couldn't run for a month and got Hoka One One's because they were the ones that didn't hurt my heel. I'm fairly certain this was insertional achilles tendonitis. Anyways, I was luckily able to run basically pain free in April, but my left heel never fully healed. 

In June the pain started to come back in my left heel, but no where's near as bad. In fact, it was more like stiffness, and I felt it in my calf too. I still kept running but started stretching more and it helped. 

I had a thought like: *What would happen if my right heel started hurting too?*

A week later, I was doing yard work and then I shortly noticed on my run that my right heel was popping. Then when I pressed down on my right achilles with my thumb, like right on the tendon, there was pain. Yet, when I did this on my left achilles, there was no pain, yet my left heel still hurt, just in a different way.

Some runs it never flares up. Whenever my left is stiff/hurts, my right isn't/doesn't and vice versa. 

I'm still running just because the pain never exceeds a 1.5/10 and I have to get the mileage in. But I'm now worried about my right heel because on my long run my right calf started twinging. In some ways, my right heel injury feels more like a typical achilles injury. I have no clue what the heck I did to my left heel, maybe it's a bone spur.

Anyways, I'm super frustrated and currently icing my right heel as I write this. I often wonder if I will ever run pain free again.",1626530925

To give background, I’ve used the runners world “Break 3hr” training plan and it’s worked nicely my first 2 marathons (2:55 PR). While the plan is great, I wanted to challenge myself/change plans to try and hit sub 2:50. Being that I was one of the unfortunate 9k+ people that got denied from Boston after qualifying this year, I thought I shouldn’t leave anything up for debate my next race and use their specific plan. I started with the level 4 plan but it quite honestly kicked my ass to the point where I felt that I should back down a bit and move to level 3 with a bit less MPW. I’m currently 9 weeks into the plan and still find it crushing me week over week, particularly the Fartlek runs and Sunday tempo runs. Goes without saying that all training plans aren’t easy but this one feels particularly tough. I tend to struggle to hold the paces the plan suggest to run based on my expected finishing times. I feel as though if I pushed myself to get those times, I’d overtrain and get hurt.

I was really wondering if anyone else has tried these plans (because I haven’t seen them recommended once since joining the sub), and if so, what are your thoughts? If not, any advice on how to get past it all besides slow my pace since I already do that when needed.

My current situation is the following.
I can train 3 times a week for 45 min max.

Tonight I was doing a ladder workout (nothing too fast) and for the majority had no issues with them (even as they ran in lane one or walked in front of me/weren’t paying attention even the “coaches”. I put coaches in parentheses because I have to say the activities I see them doing are questionable but it’s good seeing young kids getting involved.

Anyways- towards the end of my workout they start doing activities and push-ups near the start line. This is a small 4 lane track and the football field has a barrier set up so people don’t walk on it. The group had plenty of room to spread out but instead chose to take up all 4 lanes. The first 3 times I passed them I was on recovery laps and went into the grass. Due to the football field barrier it’s barely a foot wide and very uneven.

AdvancedRunning,scatterbrained_mugen,Major Regression in Performance Coming Off a ~4 Month Break - Mental Issue or Potential Health Concern?,"Let me preface that it's been about 5 months since I ended a 4-month break from running, and I've been running on a somewhat regular basis (3-4 times / week; &lt;= 5 miles / run). The post is regarding a concern that I'm now no where near performance-wise where I was before even starting my marathon training plan about a year ago.

Back in September 2020 I started the Pfitz 18/55 plan to train for a solo marathon. When starting training I had recently hit PRs with a 1:29:13 half and 18:58 5k, and I had been running regularly for about a year prior.

About 8 weeks into the program I had an IT band injury that I tried to fight through (stupidly). I aggravated it to the point where I had to ditch the program and plans on running the marathon. Roughly from November to January I stopped running completely. I bought a rowing machine and did that roughly 3-4 times a week, since that didn't aggravate my IT band.

By January I was healed up and ready to run again injury-free, though I continued to avoid running because of a combination of the shitty cold weather and a health concern. Essentially, I suddenly started experiencing paresthesia in different areas of my body at random points in the day. I tried eliminating different things from my daily routine to see if it would help resolve the issue. Eventually, I went to a neurologist and got tested for a bunch of things, and fortunately everything came back clean. However, since then it's still gone undiagnosed and I continue to experience it (often at the beginning of runs but it goes away after running for \~5-10 minutes). It's worth noting that the sensation is mild enough that I could definitely run through it, but it definitely is uncomfortable.

Around March I started running again regularly. However, since then it's been like 5 months of running regularly and both my pace and endurance feel like they've taken a huge hit. Nowadays I'm looking at 4-5 mile runs at a 7:55 pace and feeling gassed at the end of it. For context my medium-long runs back when I was training used to be at that pace and I felt fine at the end of those.

I wouldn't be as concerned if I was *just* starting up back again, but it's been 5 months now and I'm seeing no progress. The ""best"" run I've had since  was once when I ran an 8 mile run at a 7:15 pace, but I'm having a lot of difficulty getting anywhere near close to that level.

Is this likely just a mental block (have you or someone you know experienced a drop off like this before)? If so, how do I get over it?

Or should I at least expect to have seen some improvement over the past 5 months, and maybe I need to see if something else healthwise is going on?

I was also chatting with a guy who's easy runs seems to be in the very low 8s/high 7s but has a marathon PR of 3:20. Just going off Strava HR data (obviously potentially flawed), it does look like these are realistic easy paces for these people, with HRs in the 130/140/low 150s. To clarify, these are awesome race times but these runners also have great easy paces. A 45 minute 10k means 6.2 7:15 miles which is like a 1:15 min/mile off of their easy paces. 

Personally I do most of my easy runs in the mid/high 9s, anything in the 8s generally spikes my HR. However I can very comfortably do a 5:30 mile, sub 20 in the 5k and if I raced a 10k I imagine my target time would be somewhere around 42 or lower. I'm a relatively young guy (27) but I'm pretty surprised at the relative closeness between these easy paces and race paces. 

Am I abnormal here? Or do these runners just have a ton of untapped speed potential? Its kind of crazy to be giving advice to someone outrunning me on an easy run, but it really does feel like they're underperforming relative to their easy baseline. I do follow training plans so I think my speed is pretty well developed.",1626374692
AdvancedRunning,bigtechdroid,How long until I can run a sub 3 hour marathon?,"I have never raced before. I currently run 21 miles per week and increasing every week 10%. My 5k is 20 minutes. 

I might be the only one but I would be embarrassed to run anything over a 3 hour marathon. It's a goal I have set and to change it would not be worth participating.

I'm prepared to put in the time, my guess it will take a year of good mileage but I come here to get advice on how long it's going to take.",1626371611
AdvancedRunning,alyruns,"Training advice: tips to improve tempo runs? I feel very comfortable on long runs with MP work, and kind of out of sorts in my threshold paces","I just started week 2 of the pfitz marathon plan (18/55) and the biggest difference between this plan and how I trained for my last marathon is all the LT work. The first workout was 8 miles total with 4 at LT and I decided to break it up into 2 and 2 with a few min recovery in between because the humidity was crazy. By the end of the last mile I was definitely on the struggle bus. I averaged 8:08min/mile for the 4 mile. The thing that kind of threw me off is I recently did a long run workout (not as part of the training plan) that had 3 miles at MP towards the end of a 13 miler and I averaged 8:00 without really trying so I know I can hit those paces (I think I had really good weather on that run which probably helped a lot)

Anyway my actual question is, what’s the best way to improve tempo runs? Repeats on the higher end of the pace range? Trying to go straight through on the lower end of the range?",1626371291

AdvancedRunning,jww849,On track to BQ?,"Looking for some advice on my training and if those who have BQ'd think i'm on track to do it this fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backround:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19M, basically never ran in my life till 2.5 years ago. Stupidly signed up for a marathon 2 years ago on basically zero training and fell in love with the sport. Ran 4:06. Latley I have ramped up my training in a big way, I basically just ran my first 40 mile week in early this year, and now i'm putting on 70 mile weeks with no injuries or problems at all. My training consists of one long run, one medium long run about 5 miles shorter than my LR, one tempo (2 ish mile warm up, 6-8 tempo around 6:20 ish per mile, 2 mile cool down), one easy day and the other days about 10 miles per day. One day off every 10 days or so. All this volume has definitely helped my performance, I just PR'd the 5k last weekend at 17:09. Although i'm definetly getting more fit, I have my doubts to if I have what it takes to go 2:55 ish this fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Training Questions:

1. I'm basiclly doing 0 workouts right now. Should I add them in? if so how often and what types of workouts.

2. Keep increasing volume as long as I don't get hurt? I've gone from 40 mpw to 70 mpw in like the last 2 months. Don't want to increase too fast but I think I could peak around 80-85 ish by late summer/early fall before the taper

3. Any other tips to optomize training?

AdvancedRunning,ScottS93,2 Workouts vs 3 Workouts per week,"Hi, long time lurker here.

Just a general question I'd be interested to get your insight on this training philosophy.

Currently 6 weeks into a 18 week marathon block aiming for a sub-3 marathon.

I am currently running 100-105km per week (with a peak week of 130km planned) making significant improvements in terms of workout performance. Last week was a Tuesday 3x2km at LT w/ 1k float, Thursday 4x5 mins at 5k pace followed by 5x2 mins at 3k pace with 2 min walk recovery and a 26k long run with 2x5km at marathon pace on sunday. Rest of the week is all easy/recovery running.

My up build weeks are looking fairly similar in terms of a threshold workout tuesdays, faster speed thurdays and long run w/ blocks of marathon pace sunday. Has anyone used anything similar to this as I see alot of plans only doing 1 workout per week plus a long run (occasionally with MP efforts in e.g. Pfitz). I've planned a recovery week with all easy and strides every 4 weeks as well.

I do quite a bit of S&amp;C to keep niggles and injuries at bay, yes alot of my easy runs are sluggish because I am recovering from workouts - is this training style (2 mid week workouts plus quality long run) an injury waiting to happen.

Thanks a lot for any responses in advance.",1626358938
AdvancedRunning,movingmeditation,My legs feel hollow,"A quick snap shot: Ran a 28km trail race last Saturday (2300 ft up / 3000ft down). Did well enough 3rd OA and 2nd female. On Sunday I swam and did an easy bike ride. Monday swim only. I’ve got back to running since Tuesday. I just finished a run this morning and my legs feel like total trash. Hollow. They have all week. It’s like I’m not recovering at all. I’m sleeping and hydrating and doing all the things - but I feel weak. I’m at a loss here bc I’m usually plenty recovered by now.

The only random factor that may impact this is that I was bit by a wasp/hornet during the race. I’m deff having a reaction (swelling, redness, itching) but I really don’t think that’s related.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome. I want my legs back!",1626351218
AdvancedRunning,buddhahat,Did I do the right thing?,"Bailed out of my run this morning.  I've had 2 hard runs this week plus my 15km easy run yesterday (Wednesday, Singapore time) turned into running the final 5km or so at HM pace because I was feeling really good.  Quads and calves have been sore the last day or so from the repeats on Monday and the threshold run on Tuesday.    I run between 75 and 80km a week with one day off (Sunday).   


I was wondering whether I should take a day off today (12km easy was on the schedule) but kitted up anyway.  Legs felt weak from the get go but that happens sometimes when I'm just getting started (I'm 55).  But I kept feeling off and then my left calf started tightening up so I just thought all the signs were saying stop.  So I did.  Only about 300 meters into the run.  Lol. 

Did I stop too soon?  Should I have run it out a little further to see if I warmed up properly?  I think this is only the 2nd run I've bailed on in 2 years.   

Just wondering how others manage/deal with this?",1626313436

AdvancedRunning,rbickfor1988,Changing foot strike,"I’m wondering how to go about changing my foot strike pattern. Probably 8-9 years ago, I had a cut across the bottom of my foot, and in the 3 weeks it took to heal, I pretty much completely changed my running form. 

I land on the outsides of both feet (though it’s more exaggerated on the right foot— where the actual injury was) and then “roll” in. 

I have done a couple marathons, but generally a condensed 10-12 week training plan has been sufficient. This time I’m trying to give myself a full 20 weeks ahead of Boston, but the miles increase seems to be hitting me harder than in the past. 

I’m 33F, and I am maybe 5lbs heavier than normal (still working on kid 4’s baby weight), but I’m wondering if the extended training might be exacerbating issues from my foot strike. Currently at 30-35 mpw, up from usually 25; and this will only continue to rise as I get further into training. 

I realize age and KS summers could also be culprits for making my legs feel like they just can’t recover at all, but I also don’t think changing this would hurt in the long run, and the amount of miles I’m doing now might be an ideal time to do this. 

I can add a pic of my wear pattern, if that would help clarify what the heck I’m talking about. Thanks!",1626287919

AdvancedRunning,WhiteHawk1022,Feedback on my plan for a spring 2022 BQ attempt,"Hey r/AdvancedRunning, looking for some feedback on my plan for a BQ attempt (sub-3) at a spring marathon. I'm tentatively planning on the Vermont City Marathon in May 2022. Background info:

* Age: 33
* Sex: Male
* Current MPW + pace: 30 mpw; aerobic pace: 8:00-8:30/mile
* Previous peak MPW: 61 mpw is my highest ever (fall 2019)
* Previous PRs:
   * Mile: 5:24 (2019)
   * 5k: 18:26 (2016)
   * Half marathon: 1:23:47 (2019)
   * Marathon: 3:43:39 (2014 - my only marathon to date. I've attempted to get to the marathon several more times but been sidelined by injuries.)

I got injured at the end of 2019 and cut back on running for most of 2020 to focus on strength training. I still kept up with running, but only recently started building volume again.  I just completed Pfitzinger's 30 miles per week base training plan, and I'm about to start his 12-week half marathon plan, which starts at 31 miles per week and peaks at 47 miles. My target race is in mid-October.

After the half, I plan to take a couple of weeks off, then pursue one of these options:

1. Maintain mileage throughout the winter (potentially race here and there), so I can start Pfitz's 18/55 plan after the new year. 
2. Get back to base training with Pfitz's 60 miles per week plan to prep for his 18/70 marathon plan. 

Open to any thoughts or suggestions regarding these two paths. The most I've ever run in a single week is 61 miles, so the second option (prepping for the 18/70 plan) would be new territory for me. Do you think the build from where I am now to where I would want to be by next spring is too much?",1626271632

AdvancedRunning,Matth745,Nike Odyssey React Replacement," This may be a bit of a long shot, but I'm trying to find a good replacement for the Nike Odyssey React 2s, which Nike appear to have discontinued.

To give you some background, I originally used Nike Lunarglides as my general training shoe, but a few years ago they got discontinued and ""replaced"" with the Epic and Odyssey Reacts. I chose the Odysseys and found them really similar to the older pre-version 8 Lunarglides, and so as able to transition without any problems.

However, Nike do not appear to have an obvious replacement for the Odysseys and I'm struggling to find a suitable shoe to transition to. I tried the React Milers but found them a bit ""clumpy"" and they rubbed the balls of my feet something terrible after about 5km on every run.

    ### Training
    I've never been much of a long-distance guy. I've always said anything over 1600m on a track is sacrilege. 400m through the mile is my bread and butter, but I'm tired of not having a competent 5K time to carry around. I decided that would change this summer.
    I don't do well with high mileage, I break down fairly easily, so I only averaged 35mpw before my taper. Two workouts per week (interval builder workout, tempo run, speed repeats, and hill repeats). One long run per week, usually around 80 minutes.

    I was originally planning on running a road race, but I've been training primarily in the evening, so I figured running around 8:30 on a track would be my best bet.
    Two buddies from high school ran with me through the first two miles. One of them did all the work for the first mile, and it went by like a breeze. He was pacing perfectly, calling out splits every 200m - the first mile was effortless. As the second mile wore on, I had to start pushing the pace a few times as I could tell he was starting to slip. They dropped off at the two-mile mark and I was all on my own for the last mile. This is where I really benefited from running on a track. My mind started to get a bit foggy, but I could focus on hitting pace for each 400m, and once I got down to the last 800m I knew I had a good time coming.

•Other info: About 170lbs and previous running weight was 125-130. similar body fat percentage.

I am looking to begin training for a marathon I am running against my roommate in one month’s time. I know this is nowhere close to ideal but we have money on the line, as well as pride. What is the safest possible way to go about training for this?

I was imagining something like 10-15 miles this week, 15-20 week 2. 20-25 week 3, with one or two easy runs on the fourth week. I understand the risk for injury with such little training but I am doing this with hopes of minimizing risk. 

Would cross-training the majority of my mileage help? I have the muscular strength (i think) it is mainly the cardio i am lacking, how can i build this up as quickly as possible? Swimming and Biking are both on the table.

any advice is greatly appreciated, other than “don’t do it”. i ran a half before without training so i somewhat understand the toll it takes on your body. 

If it helps my roommate is in ~5 hr marathon shape. Tips on pacing are also appreciated. I would like to be around 4:15 to 4:45 realistically.",1626234721

I realize that for every run whether easy, speed, long, or race I always wear the same combination of ""lower body"" clothing. My kit consists of:

* compression shorts/leggings (Under Armour ColdGear leggings in the winter, Under Amour HeatGear/RUSH shorts or 3/4 leggings in the non-winter)
* 9 inch inseam Under Armour Tech shorts over top
* no garments under the compression layer

I realize there are a whole host of other shorts options out there, but I am unable to find good written advice comparing and contrasting shorts based on qualities such as:

* inseam length
* liner/no-liner
* material
* brand

How have you evaluated different shorts options for your kit? Do you feel that certain shorts are better for certain conditions (i.e workout vs race, heat)? How did you go about learning what you now like, or is it best to simply buy a bunch of different pairs and see what shakes out?",1626212017

**Training**

I got back into training during COVID and have been inching closer to my college PRs from 10 years ago. I had been piecing together my own training, but decided to follow a plan this time because I was getting tired of brainstorming workouts every week. I decided to use the Hanson's 5k 13-week plan to try and get that elusive 14:59.

Training didn't really go well. The workouts were kicking my butt from the get go and I was feeling pretty beat up after the first few weeks. I eventually realized I had received my COVID vaccine the 1st week of the plan and even though I didn't have any major side effects, there must have been some residual fatigue from it. Once I was feeling better my knee flared up and I had to take 2 weeks off while the swelling went away.

For some more self-inflicted training woes, my partner and I decided to move to Denver and planned on leaving around the 10 week mark of the plan. I decided to abbreviate the plan and push the goal race to week 9 right before we moved.

Since the gods were smiling down on me, the PNW was hit with a heatwave and the only day we could get a moving pod was the day before the race. I ended up not running for the 5 days leading up to the race and tired/sore/stressed from the move \*shrug\*.

Anyways that's my sob story. Throughout training I kept adjusting my goal and eventually settled on just running faster than I did a few months ago (15:35). Progress is progress.

**Pre-race**

I actually raced in a full mile (4:31) 3 weeks before. It was my first track race in 10 years! It was an improvement over my 1600 last winter (4:36) but I didn't engage well during the race and was too worried about going out too fast, hitting paces, afraid of hurting, etc. My goal for this race was to worry less about the clock and engage with the runners around me.

The race was at 9 PM so I had a big lunch and let that sustain me for the day. Warmed up 3 mi, did some strides, toed the line, and hoped for the best.

**Race**

Gun went off and the front went out fast. Top guys were probably shooting for 14:45ish so I hung back and sat at the back of that pack. Went through 400 in 73 and by that point I was in a pack of 3 or 4. The pace started to slow so I went to the front with the lead pack about 40-50m ahead. 1st mile was 4:54.

2nd mile I focused on racing and trying to catch guys who were falling off of the lead pack. I was still in the front of my group with a guy hanging on my shoulder the entire time. I kept thinking ""This guy is just going to let me do all the work and drop me with a few laps left, isn't he?"". We kept pushing and catching guys. Didn't catch the 2 mi split, but by my math it was about 4:57.

3rd mile the legs started to feel a little stale and just not sharp at all, but we kept hitting fairly even splits. With 800 to go the buy behind me made his move and surged past me. With 350 left I put started my kick, but didn't quite have enough in the final 200 to catch him at the line (came through 3 mi in 14:50). Results have me .12s behind him, 6th overall.

15:22 and although not as fast as I wanted to be, still making progress from 3 months ago.

**Post-race**

Pleasantly surprised with the result. I'm bummed the past week of training didn't go well, because I think I would have had a shot at a PR. I thought I raced well and am glad I pushed myself to run because I almost decided to skip it altogether.

I've been wanting to run an HM this fall so I've been looking at Chicago. I will try to squeeze in a quick HM training cycle before then and follow that up with a 5k before the winter. Hoping the HM strength will finally get me to sub 15.

AdvancedRunning,HavingAPfitz,Marathon Training if long-term goal is XC (5/8K) Distances?,"* **Age**: 28
* **Sex** F
* **Current MPW**: 38-45 (6wk trailing average 39mpw) 
* **Previous peak MPW**: 50 (high school so 🤷‍♀️)

I'm a hobbyjogger that vastly prefers shorter distances. After an injury/COVID-induced break, I've been training regularly since February to get back in shape, beat my 5000m PR from a 2019 time trial (18:53), and get fast enough to participate in the competitive portion of a local post-collegiate XC league. An incorrigible workout hero, the lack of group runs during the pandemic gave me the opportunity to really focus on a slow build of mileage and this is the longest I've been injury free since middle school with the highest sustained mileage. 

I think I'm aerobically underdeveloped -- about 4,000 lifetime miles based on Strava+old HS training logs -- and have suffered at the end of races for it, so I have been focusing my training on longer tempo runs with relatively little faster work compared to my past peak fitness. 

However…the lack of injury and seemingly every person I run with starting their training for Boston/Chicago has me considering trying out the marathon distance with a late autumn race. 

It would let me continue running with some good folks, get me accustomed to higher weekly mileage and prep for a killer 5K training block next summer/fall, and given my 5000m PR was run off relatively low mileage with too much quality work, probably not hurt my chances of achieving my goals for XC in 2022 too much.

1. Would it be insane to try and munge together the Pfitz 18/55 and 18/70 plans into something like an 18/60 and shoot for a late Oct/early November race with a goal of 3:20 or so? 

2. Is this counter-productive if I know I enjoy 5/8K more than longer races? Am I likely better served with several cycles of HM and base building if I plan to flex from 5K up to HM for most future races?

3. The answer for someone at my level probably is just ""run more, don't stress the details"", yea?

Recent Workouts:

* 4x1mi 2' rest: 6:15/6:25/6:35/6:31 -- it was 96º and incredibly humid so I think I'm in marginally better shape than this. Went out way too fast.

* 12.5mi progression run - last 5 at 7:20/7:15/7:09/7:00/7:00. Ran Sunday and felt like a medium/hard effort but definitely could have carried through to 13.11. Came at the end of my three highest mileage weeks. Legs feel fresh today.",1626195577
AdvancedRunning,LAANGRetention,Thoughts on pacing for 2 mile race in summer heat and humidity,"Just wondering what everyone thinks, I have  two mile race this Saturday at 7 p.m., and it'll likely be mid 80s with like 75-90 percent humidity (New Orleans baby!).  I ran my 5k PR back in the fall with a 20:18 (6:33/mi), and my 10k PR in February with a 43:51 (I expected a better time but my legs were oddly tired from the start).  

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking I'd shoot for like a 6:30, but with the weather...I'm just not sure.  I know it's short, so I will just be really heating up when I finish, but its also really hot.  On the other hand if I go out at like 7:00/mi, I'm worried I won't finish as quickly as I could.

Just curious, really, because if it were a 5k I'd just adjust down a little, but the odd shorter distance has me unsure.  I've been running regularly these days between 4-8 milers at like 7:30 pace and its tough but not killing me.  Anyway, thanks for your thoughts.",1626194602

I have taken the past 5 years off of marathon/half marathon running (during which I only ran 5-10 mpw) due to business/personal responsibilities, but am now getting back to higher mileage. Until 5 years ago I was a fairly avid runner and was able to pull of a 7:19 pace on a half marathon which was a huge accomplishment for me. I have been able to get back up to 30-40 mpw over the past couple of months now without much issue except I have found that I am running VERY slowly (11 mil miles, sometimes 12) and attempting even a 10 min or lower pace is difficult compared to what it used to be 5 years ago. I am in sweltering hot/humid Georgia, so I know the heat plays into it and I am now 50 years old.

AdvancedRunning,thief1434,"Returning to running after time off making lifting gains (using periodization) while staying consistent with runs and continually improving, thoughts and questions","Howdy there everyone. While I've accepted I will never be the guy to run 17min 5ks, I can usually get between 18-20min pretty consistently, usually in the 19's, and I'm pretty happy, but know if I leaned fully into running I could probably do faster, but I want to be a diversified athlete despite my love for running and that being my initial fitness background (funnily enough my running is better having added other stuff since I did xc and track in high school).

I've always been into running and calisthenics and can rip a bunch of pull ups off no problem, but recently I've gotten more into lifting and was experimenting with periodization. At first I was just doing a weird strength program but as I learned more and talked with a friend who has a degree in strength and nutrition and works as personal trainer I went more into periodization. 

**What I've been reading:**

* I initially started with *The Tactical Barbell 1 and 2*, but part of my issue is that his blocks only include strength which is only one small part strength endurance training. I think incorporating book 2, his endurance manual, is more useful, but it's still not a full answer
* 
The National Strength and Conditioning Association's publishings on block programming and training which I think is a more realistic approach to both running and lifting


**My issue:**

During this strength training block which I planned poorly, I initially couldn't run much because the strength training was too intensive to run a lot, but i still did low aerobic and some sprints/track endurance work, but switched to blocks as I learned more. However, I pretty much stopped running for ~1.5 months during this time, and recently started back up running and have found my cardio fitness has *significantly* declined with my 5k time being poor relatively, and my endurance, speed, etc also having fallen. It is honestly super discouraging to do a run I could easily do prior and struggle with it, but I know this can be easily fixed with a slow ramp up back to where I was, though the issue is not starting out too strong to my own detriment.


**My question:**

To those of you who have had a similar break from running, and those who have a need/desire/etc, to do strength and endurance training, how do you balance it out? A lot of what I read is to do 2-4 week blocks of each type of training, but I can't really envision myself taking that much time off from running and maintaining a good cardio base. I think it's doable, but I'm not knowledgeable on doing it.

**What I want:**

I want to be a tactical athlete. What this means is while i have some interest in hypertrophy and looking 'bigger', I want to be strong and able to lift weight and move weight without getting tired, but I also want to be able to be fast. Deadlifting 400lbs is awesome, but if I can't run 3mi in at least under 20-21 min then that strength is a bit pointless.

**Conclusion:**

Finding a good balance in overall fitness is difficult and something that's attainable, but requires knowledge. 

Apologies if I'm stepping too much into strength training for this sub, but I'd greatly appreciate some guidance or material to help myself figure out how to find this balance. Cheers and thanks!",1626187196

**Background/Training**

I'm a washed up D1 middle-distance specialist who graduated college in 2018 with what I would soon discover was a back stressie (turns out being in pain any time you're not curled up in the fetal position for three months is not a soft tissue issue from bad form no matter what your ATs say!). Stopped running for about 5 months after graduation due to a combo of the stress fracture and the shocking freedom of not ""needing"" to run for the first time in 4 years. And then I never really got back into training again. I'd go on casual watch-less runs around the neighborhood for fun, did some summer trail running, and did a lot of outdoorsy things like hiking and cross country skiing because I live in Montana and it's basically a crime if you're not outside, but I never had any sort of ""training regimen"". Heck I couldn't tell you my mpw or even my average pace per mile if you'd held a gun to my head. 

Then I met some friends-of-a-friend who were doing this race and I figured it'd be fun so I signed up. I'm probably pretty arrogant from the ""former D1 runner"" thing so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to build up to. Then I googled the race. Average elevation is 9,000 feet and it peaks at 9,600 feet. Lots of climbing (full marathon has 4,600 feet, not sure about the half). So about two months from the race I figured I should probably get a little serious. I started running (almost) every day and pushing up my distances on the weekends by doing longer trail runs. I live in the rural Rockies so my running options are ""running from one end of town to the other on mostly flat roads"" or ""10 mile 3,000 foot climb up the side of a mountain"". Due to time constraints I did the town running before or after work and on the weekends would go run up and down the sides of mountains. I figured that would average out to the kind of terrain the race is on which is forest service roads with rolling hills. 

Due to my (pretty lax) training and the fact that my last race was an 800m in 2018 I decided to make my goals pretty chill. (1) I wanted to finish feeling pretty good. I hadn't run 13 miles in one go in over three years so I figured even working up to that distance would be pretty good. (2) Checking the results showed me that it was pretty rare for women to get under 2 hours and I figured I was not in shape to be the #1 woman (learning humility!). Also, by doing some very inexact math, I figured most of my trail running was averaging 13 minute pace so breaking 2:45 would be about that pace. 

**Pre-race**

Oh boy. I was supposed to stay with the aforementioned friends-of-friends in Ennis for the night before the race and then drive up with them in the morning. However, while on my way to Ennis they called to let me know that due to a big mix up with some of their friends who had to drop out last minute to go on a wildfire (#MontanaProblems) one of the rooms had been cancelled and there wouldn't be any room for me unless I slept on the floor. So, my options were to pay 50 bucks to sleep on a hotel room floor, camp up at where the race is, or leave at 3am to make it to the race the next day. I knew a couple people camping up there but I figured since I had to turn around to head home to get my camping gear if I chose that option that I might as well just go to bed early and sleep in my own bed instead of planning an impromptu camping trip at 7pm the night before a half-marathon.

I was planning on just driving myself in a big suffer-fest but luckily I have some angels for friends who volunteered to wake up at 3am and drive me the 3 hours to the race. We did exactly that and I not only got to the race in plenty of time, I got to watch the sun rise over the Madison Mountains after waking up from a nice little truck nap. Had a quick breakfast, grabbed my bib, put on my vest with my trusty bear spray, and got in school buses for the drive to the start. The race is a point-to-point and there's no place to park at the start so everyone parks at the finish and then gets driven to start. It was a very weird feeling to drive over the very place you'll be running in 15 minutes. 

**Race**

The race starts at 9,250 feet with an incredibly steep uphill. I started out running because it feels weird to start a race by walking but started walking about a quarter into the hill. My race strategy (worked out while doing this hill lol, I am clearly not great at planning ahead) was to be very chill (aiming for 13 mile pace) until mile 6, catalogue how I'm feeling and then decide if I'm gonna push it or just maintain for the rest of the race. I came through mile 1 in 12:15 (the race director had put out cones marking out each mile which was a life-saver) and mile 2 in about 10:30 which made sense as mile 2 was mostly downhill. Around here I found myself in probably the top 25 of the race which made me a little nervous as I hadn't planned for that but I consoled myself by figuring it was probably just because they started the marathoners with us. 

The race is along the Gravelly Range and spends a lot of time at 9,600 feet. The altitude didn't bother me which I chalk up to living at 5,000 feet and running a lot in the mountains at even higher altitude. There were a lot of (1+ mile) climbs which I decided merited a run/walk combo where I would count to 120 while power walking and then start running for a bit until my calves told me to walk again. This strategy meant that for the first 2/3rds of the race I passed people while they walked and then they'd pass me while I'd walked. I was not a fan of this, I think mostly because I've become a running misanthrope from my lonely trail runs. My body felt pretty good when I passed through mile 6 aside from some stomach pain from drinking too much gatorade (dumb move on my part; I generally rarely drink on my runs but all the people with running vests made me feel like I should) but I had faith that it would pass and it mostly did within a couple of miles. 

At mile 7 I decided it was time to actually start trying to run instead of keeping it easy. This morphed into a goal to not get passed for the rest of the race and a plan to push the flats and the uphills and just coast on the downhills. Ironically the downhills were my least favorite part in the back half of the race because in my tired state I felt less stable on them in the gravel and because I could tell they were beating up my quads (contributing to the instability). With a couple of miles to go I figured that I was on pace for a 2:14 as long as I didn't blow up. With probably .5 miles to go I saw woman with a medal around her neck walking towards me. I wrongly interpreted this as meaning I was just around the corner from finishing and let me tell you there is no worse feeling than rounding a corner expecting the finish and seeing nothing but trees. Somehow kept running through the sadness and crossed the finish in 2:14.36. I was proud of the time but honestly more proud of my pace predicting ability. All those college workouts working on pace sense paid off I guess.

**Post-race**

Chilled at the finish and cheered for my friends as they came in. Got some watermelon, drank a beer. Walked around knowing my calves were gonna kill me later and then hitched a ride with my friends for the bumpy 1.5 hour ride back to Ennis. Met up with some other friends and we had beer and pizza at the Burnt Tree Brewery before stopping at Norris Hot Springs on the way home in the mid-90s heat. Is there any better post-race activity that beer, pizza and hot springs? No.

This race definitely reminded me of how fun it is to have a goal so the plan from here is to try to up my mileage more to be able to tackle a local trail 30k in September. I'd also like to run this half again and I think, with the right training I could win it. First place this year (first *and* second were women!) ran a 1:50 and I think if I started running more than 30 miles a week and did something other than easy runs I could win it. 

**TL;DR** Washed-up runner gets back on the horse, runs a half-marathon at 9,000 feet a lot faster than she expects and celebrates with beer, pizza, and geothermally heated water.

Yesterday was the first 12 miler for the training cycle - and at mile 10.5 the same thing happened with my calves - inside of both started biting - I was able to get them stretched out and finish the run. It was muggy and my shirt and shorts were soaked through with sweat (as normal). 

For nutrition, I start with UCAN Pre just before the run (which usually covers me for 90 min), then a Spring gel at 90 min and another at 2 hours (2:13 run yesterday). Took a Salt Stick Salt Caplet at the start and at the halfway point along with 2 chewables during the run. Went through 44oz of Sword (I use that instead of plain water for the sodium, calories and electrolytes.

This matches how I have approached both previous marathons. I used to think the calf cramps were dehydration based/lack of sodium but after yesterday I am not so sure. Could it be I am taking in too much sodium/nutrition for the run (that was suggested)? Could it be that 700mg per hour of sodium wasn't enough? Or should I really be looking at biomechanics (overworked calves)?

**Background and more Info:** M35. I've got into running late and have almost no racing experience.  I train mostly continously since the beginning of 2020 and increase my mileage (before this I'd only run during the summer and low volume).

I think now is the time to switch into a focused training plan and the first race I got in mind is a 5k at the beginning of September. I own books by Daniels and Pfitzinger (faster road racing) and prefer the approach of the latter with faster long runs. All the training plans except for one HM plan are less mileage than where I'm at right now. Is it reasonable to stay at or even increase my mileage by picking one of the plans and just adding (easy) miles? I'm a bit lost on how to best approach the rest of the year, so help is very welcome!

AdvancedRunning,gunkonkpngff,How to know if I’m overtraining?,"I’m a 17 year old club runner and I’m aiming to dip under 16 for the 5k by the end of the year.

The start of my year went really well as I gradually cut down my PB to 16:11. However, my performances then started to decline even though I was training harder and maintaining 55mpw.

This accumulated in an extremely disappointing 5k of 16:55 last week.

My runs are slower yet are feeling harder and I am finding it hard to distinguish whether I am doing too much, causing me to decline or am I doing too little?",1626080846

\### Training

Back in a marathon build after running 1600TT in early June.

&amp;#x200B;

3 Weeks at 60+ MPW

1 Week at 50 miles (on vacation)

1 Week at 49 miles (race week, includes half marathon race)

&amp;#x200B;

I added in a rest day to my weekly training about 3 weeks ago. I feel a lot fresher and notice that I have less niggles during the week. With a rest day, typical schedule looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

M: Rest

T: 8mi easy with drills/strides

W: 10mi (run a hilly route at a steady pace or 6mi tempo baked in)

Th:8mi easy

F: 6-8mi easy with drills/strides

Sa: Mix of tempo/interval work. Typically 10-12 miles

Su: LR (at least 14 mi)

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really taper that well for this race. 2 weeks prior I traveled to Texas for a week and ate/drank way too much. Ran a lot just to keep the weight off. Temperature was warm as well. 4 days prior to the race, I did a nice 2mi tempo (6:28/mi), 2x800 (2:47/rep), 2x400 (77/rep) workout to get the legs moving faster. I didn't do much speed work on vacation and this felt comfortable. Th,Fri, Sat were easy runs with drills/strides at the end

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Race was at 7am with 6:30am packet pickup. Woke up at 4am. I use a bunch of BPN products so had my usual greens/in focus (caffeine) drink to get the bowels moving. Had a slice of toast with butter. Finished up with an electrolyte drink. This is my normal routine before long runs. Did this for an 18mi LR recently with 16oz of water and 2 GUs. Felt just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Drank another electrolyte drink about 30 mins before race. 2mi warm up with drills/strides. Race start was delayed by about 15mins. I sat down for about 10mins and probably should have done some drills/strides again

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Within a few steps of the start, I felt my hamstring tighten up. It felt like a cramp but not really sure how that was possible. Went away but this came back to haunt me later.

&amp;#x200B;

Weather was 70 degrees and over 90% humidity during the entire race. Something I really should have respected more.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan was to go out in 6:40 for the first 4mi and then 6:30 for the next 4. Depending on how I felt, would try to maintain or pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 1-4: Per my splits above, clearly failed at going out slower. Lead pack of 6 went out fast. Probably under 6:00/mi. I let them go but the group behind me was too slow. At mile 2, someone dropped off in the lead pack and he stayed with me for the next mile. But after that, I was on my own for the entire race. My lovely hamstring tightness came back again towards the end of mile 3 but it definitely felt more like a cramp this time around. Was planning to take a gel at mile 5. Instead, took a GU and water at mile 4. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 5-7: With concerns about cramping, I dialed back the pace for mile 5. However, I felt good aerobically so couldn't stay disciplined and ended up picking up the pace again for miles 6-7. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 8-10: Again felt my hamstring start to cramp so I popped my last gel. Missed the water station at mile 8 and didn't get water again until mile 10. After I popped my gel, I made the call to slow down and just finish the race. Passed one more guy who fell off from the lead pack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 11-Finish: It finally happened at mile 11. My left hamstring fully locked up. I stopped and stretched it out. Based on the disparity between my moving time on strava (also stopped my watch for a minute) and official time, probably stopped completely for 2-3 minutes. I was almost certain that I would cramp again through the last couple miles. Somehow did not.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Finished 5th overall. Though I'm pretty sure the course is short since both Strava/Garmin are showing under 13 mi.  Aside from the very start, no one passed me even with my cramp. If I didn't cramp, the next guy finished 8mins ahead of me so I still would have been by myself. Friend works at a nearby restaurant and had a few beers with him after. As I'm writing this, my right hamstring is starting to cramp up...

&amp;#x200B;

\### Learnings and Next Steps

Disappointed about cramping up but I'm happy with the effort and more importantly, the things I learned. It's still a PR for me. My last official race was this same race 3 years ago and I ran something like 1:44.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously would have liked a better gut check on my current fitness. The temperature really didn't help. And I should have adapted my race plan as a result. Pacing needs to improve and this was a good lesson. I've gotten away with this in prior TTs (10k) but over a half and especially a marathon, I need to be more disciplined.

&amp;#x200B;

As for next steps, still planning to hit a BQ in September. My confidence is shaken a bit after feeling cramps so early in this race. While I can put some blame on the weather, nutrition is still a work in progress. Over the coming weeks, will start mixing in more interval stuff (800s, 1k) at 3k/5k pace and continue to increase the LR. There is some silver lining that aerobically, I felt good. Just the cramping is really what did me in. Between fully locking up and slowing down in the miles prior to try to avoid cramping, I'm confident that lower 1:20s is doable with better weather.

My background: I’ve been running for about 10 years, in which time I’ve done two marathons, a handful of halfs, and a lot of shorter distance races. I’m 37, and for the last 3 years have struggled with injuries - mainly Achilles and spurred from haphazard and random training methods. More recently I’m dealing with what seems like a (minor) tendinitis issue in my foot. 

I’m trying to be a little more methodical in my training for 26.2 this year, and selected the Hanson Method as a good option. However, they’re fairly outspoken against cross training (I’m including spin biking in this) and don’t put a lot of emphasis on weight training. Over the last couple of years, I’ve found value in some crushing spin workouts and believe running gains are to be had with weight training too.

[Reuters: Olympics host city Tokyo bans spectators amid COVID-19 emergency](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-set-declare-state-emergency-tokyo-area-through-aug-22-minister-2021-07-08/)

&gt; TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - The Olympics will take place without spectators in host city Tokyo, organisers said on Thursday, as a resurgent coronavirus forced Japan to declare a state of emergency in the capital that will run throughout the Games.

&gt; The move marked a sharp turnabout from as recently as last week, when some officials were still insisting they could organise the Games safely with some fans. It all but strips the global sporting showpiece, which is due to start on July 23 and run until Aug. 8, of its last vestiges of pomp and public spectacle.

&gt;Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said it was essential to prevent Tokyo, where the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 variant was spreading, from becoming a flashpoint of new infections.

&gt; People will also be asked not to gather for events on public roads, such as the triathlon, though officials said some venues outside the greater Tokyo metropolitan area would allow small numbers of spectators.

I'm not sure if this also includes the marathon, taking place in Sapporo. [Japan Running News](http://japanrunningnews.blogspot.com/2021/07/organizers-back-hokkaido-governors-call.html) reported that fans were being discouraged from attending the marathon to course to spectate.

My current PR was on 35-40ish mpw max with a lot of strength training as I am injury prone without it, and that was the first marathon I’ve completed without having even a minor injury.

However, with a recent 50K I got my average weekly mileage up to 40-50mpw.

I’ve taken some time off structured training since and focused on easy miles, running around 20mpw now and cross training. One of my more recent workouts prior to reducing my mileage was 6x800 with the following results:

1. 3:43
2. 3:55

Hansons also seemed like a contender, but I just can’t get past the max long run being 16 miles.

AdvancedRunning,JamesFattyHarden,Near Sea Level to the Rockies,"Hello, 

I am trying to determine if I have lost, gained, or maintained fitness or how I should interpret these race results after 1 month at elevation. 

First 5K:  Just above freezing, dew point low 30s, at sea level - 17:46

Second 5K: Low 60s, dew point in mid 50s, at 5,000ft above sea level - 19:50


Looking at this [article](https://runnersconnect.net/high-altitude-training-running-performance/) which references actual studies it appears that the typical runner experiences a decrease in V02 max by about 2% for every 1000 feet over 1000ft above sea level. So, at 5,000ft this puts me at essentially an 8% decrease in V02 max. 

**So should I consider that had this effort been done at sea level where I usually train I could have expected to run about 8% faster or about 18:15? And then would running at freezing temps vs low 60s explain the other 30 seconds or have I lost a step of fitness or just simply had a bad run?**

For reference, taken with a grain of salt, I use runalyze and when I was at sea level in the spring I was getting consistent V02 max estimates of 59 on my runs and now this summer at altitude for this past month I'm getting consistent V02 max estimates of 53 which is about an 8% drop.

AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Combining Daniels and Tinman workouts for marathon training,"Hey, I am currently planning my own training based on Daniels, with a T workout on tuesday, I or R workout on friday, and a mostly easy long run on sunday. Im running 45mpw, building up to 55 for marathon in late november, but mainly looking to just get faster and stronger overall rather than focus in on the marathon (it's my first, no time goal). So far it's been good but I am curious about having weeks where I do Tinman type workouts (CV instead of I, tempo instead of T), which seem to be a notch slower than Daniels' paces.

1. My understanding is that Daniels' R, I, and T paces are roughly like mile, 5k, and \~15k paces, and Tinman CV is around 10k pace and tempo is half or slower. And that typical CV workouts are intervals or fartlek like 6x(3min on, 1min off). Is that right?
2. Does this make any sense? The appeal is it's a little less stress and gets more coverage across the pace spectrum, and also those paces are more fun to run than I and T. But I could also just do easier workouts, and according to daniels the second point doesn't really matter. Mainly just curious if anyone does this and what your thoughts are on it. Also would it be better to alternate weeks and schedule it out, or just do the tinman style workouts on weeks when I'm not feeling it?",1625768952

### Background

A sub 2:00 800m has been a life-goal for me for many years now. After a couple year haitus, I started training properly again in 2019/2021 and felt good for the upcoming season. Covid struck, prompting me to start adding mileage in liu of speed as I assumed that races in the Summer of 2020 were out of the question. However, during one of our brief forays out of lockdown, I managed to sign up for a few races. I jumped straight out of an anticipated 18 month base-building block to a one month sprint to get some semblence of race sharpness. I ended up with a SB (and PB) of 2:00.29.

Fast-forward to the beginning of the 2021 track season and I was feeling supremely confident. I had just moved to a quick new training group with a great coach and had just completed the most productive block of Winter training to date. An achilles injury kept me out for 6-8 weeks at the start of the year but I had fully recovered and felt I had retained most of the the gains from the previous months. Cue the first race of the season in mid May and I had a horrendous race; boxed from the start, expended way too much energy in the first lap and felt like I was swimming in the last 150m. I finished in an extremely disappointing 2:01.70. No matter... first race of the season, just lacking race fitness and a little speed endurance, plus the wind was quite strong, right? 

This turned out to be no real anomaly, in my next three 800m races I clocked times of 2:03.30, 2:01.47 and 2:00.70. In an attempt to change it up I even deliberately ran the last one in negative splits (61/59). The frustrating thing was that the people I was training alongside were clocking times of 1:56/57 and I was training just as well as them! I told my coach that all I needed to go sub 2 was to run it as a 1 x 800m training rep and I was only half joking. I had the speed to go sub 2 (my 400m is probably around 52) and with my mileage and Winter training I should have plenty of stamina. I decided there were a couple areas that I needed to improve: the first of which was becoming comfortable with race pace and the other was improving my speed endurance as I was slowing a massive amount over the last 200m.

### Training

I follow a relatively straightforward middle distance programme with 3 quality track sessions, 2 easy runs, 1 long run and 1 day of full recovery. We are now at about the halfway point of the season so our sessions are getting progressively sharper with fewer reps and longer recovery. As an example, last week my quality sessions were the following:

- Tuesday: 4 x 400m [8:00] (59, 57, 56, 56)
- Thursday: 3 x 3 x 300m [2:00, 5:00] (47, 44, 42, 49, 45, 44)
- Saturday: 2 x 600m [18:00] (1:30.3, 1:28.2)

Regarding my perceived weakness at race pace I completed a 8 x 300m [1:30] session with all the reps done in 45s. And for my speed endurance I focused on sessions like the 2 x 600m [18:00], aiming to get into lactic and push close to race effort.

### Pre-race

I used to warm up for races slightly differently to training, doing extra drills and slightly different striding. However, I've decided that there is no reason to do anything too different to training, especially since I've been performing better in training than races recently! So I did my light jog, leg swings, drills and long strides and was ready to go.

I don't really get nervous before a race. I just tell myself that all I can do now is run as hard as I can and everything else is out of my control. So long as I put my all into the race then I can be (relatively) content.

The wind was strong and I was in lane 1. Let's go.

### Race

I went out hard, I've been told by enough people that the first 40m of an 800m is ""free"" that I now consider it a fact of racing. At the 100m break I was slightly surprised, but not displeased, to find myself leading apart from the pacemaker (pacing 400m at 57). I focused on staying comfortable and strong through 200, I thought I heard the 200m split called out at 25/26 which I ignored because that's way too fast. On the second bend I had a moment of clarity as I noticed the pacemaker, who was a couple metres ahead, have a tiny stumble. I don't know why but this felt important at the time. Into the home straight and the wind hit, *hard*. I took what little shelter I could behind the pacemaker and carried on. Towards the end of the straight I felt some of the other racers coming alongside me. That's fine, I thought, I'm not racing these people, it's only the clock I care about.

The pacemaker went through in a *perfect* 57.0 and I was around a half second behind. I managed to maintain the inside lane through the bend, someone passed me in lane two and a couple more went past in the back straight. This was great stuff, more potential wind breaks for when the gale force wind hits in the last 100m! 200m to go... I heard 1:28 as I passed. Ok, I've been in this position before, lets not fuck it up this time. I don't really remember running the last 200m, I think this is the point at which the lizard brain just completely takes over. A lizard brain that I had tricked into thinking that the only important thing at this moment was to make it to the end of this red strip of rubber, and to do it *as quickly as humanly possible*. Of course, this was also probably helped by the fact that I had found myself in a sprint finish with two other athletes. Pure pain and the home straight was almost done, I remembered where I was and made a comically oversized dip for the line then fell to my knees. 

### Post-race

I had lost. Which was annoying not for the fact that I hadn't bettered my fellow athletes but instead because it meant that the time on the board was not my own. It read 1:57.25, I was surely less than 3 seconds behind that guy right? But then again, your mental clock isn't at it's best in the dying moments of an 800m. What I was sure of was that it was close, possibly agonisingly so. I wasn't going to get my hopes up.

I had two objectives in my mind at this point: firstly to find out my time and secondly to get home in time to watch football come home. While I struggled to remove my (regretably non-super) spikes a friend came over to show me the times for my race. I had done it! It wasn't really joy that I felt but something far more akin to relief. No longer would I have to engage in conversations regarding the ifs, whens and whys of my sub 2 attempts. No longer would I have to engage in the mini crisis that is describing my old PB; do I say ""two point two nine"" or ""two dead point two nine"" or just ""two minutes""? And no longer would I have to look in the mirror every day and see a pathetic non sub two runner staring back, I had now conquered this arbitrary threshold and could hold my head up high, I was now a *pretty good* runner.

AdvancedRunning,nathanelmusic,Ultra training with a hiatal hernia?,"I'm a young, fit 24 year old male. I've been running regularly for \~5 or so years. I have my first 50-miler in late August. In November of 2020, I started having problems catching my breath/feeling incredibly out of breath--almost like I was going to suffocate to death. I couldn't eat without it happening. The drastic drop in my quality of life made me very depressed. After MONTHS of going to various doctors multiple times a week, I was told I have a sliding hiatal hernia. I began to control my diet even more which helped to alleviate some of the symptoms. 

However, it has flared up again, causing my training for this ultra to come almost to a halt. Five miles leaves me gasping for air, regurgitating food, and being able to literally feel my stomach slide above my diaphragm. My diet is the best it's ever been, I'm 6' 3"", 165 lbs (so I don't really have weight to loose), I don't smoke, drink, etc. Any tips for being able to keep running? I'm worried the only way to keep it from flaring up will be to stop doing one of the most rewarding things in my life. 

I also rock climb, which makes it flare up something awful. Also, the doctor said I wasn't a candidate for surgery due to my age/level of overall fitness.",1625755694

AdvancedRunning,grgDolly8,Are you good or bad at sticking to a methodical training program?,"I’m struggling with designing a program and often find myself just winging it. This is mostly caused by preferring a long run every 10 days and not knowing if I should focus on hills, speed, LT, or VO2max. I understand the logic of base building, working in some intensity and then tapering. But I find that my weak areas are hills, speed, and long tempos a little below my LT, which naturally seems high anyways so I don’t get much benefit from traditional LT runs of 20 minutes. So I’m basically all over the place with my training because I try to follow the typical philosophy but then shift to my weak areas in a way that seems out of sequence with what the current philosophy recommends.

Some days the GPS on my fenix 6 seems spot on but most of the time it seems wildly off (due to the tree cover I'm assuming). I don't really care about the power and all that (although my coach might find it interesting), I just want accurate pace and distance especially on the trails. Today I had 1.5 mile and 1 mile intervals and I did them on a mostly flat portion of the trail, only to find that I was pushing it on a 1.5 mile interval and my fenix 6 said I was running a 13 min mile.... yeah right.

Background: 55 year old male, consistently running 7-8 years. In Spring 2019 had my masters pr’s of 48:25 and 1:49:25 on 40 plus miles per week with one workout and one LR per week.
I ran NYC in 2019 and blew up at mile 18- shuffling home in 4:40 ( was hoping to break 4)- maxed out at 55 mpw
I haven’t raced since - had shoulder surgery in Aug 2020 and covid in Jan 2021 , both of which disrupted my training somewhat.
I’ve been healthy since and am averaging about 40 mpw over past 12 weeks with LR of 13, some strides once a week and occasional mile repeats at tempo (3x1 mi, 2 mi + 1 mi).
My “ White Whale “ is a 4 hour marathon. I’m looking at a smaller race in late March 2022 to attempt.
In prepping for that I was going to train to run a half in late Oct and use that to transition to marathon training.
My other option is to just focus on another 3 months of base building and get my weekly mileage up to mid 50s for a good duration before going into a marathon training block in the winter. I know I have the speed to run sub 4- I need the endurance , hence my thought on just focusing on mileage.

Any thoughts are appreciated from this slow masters who is still grinding.",1625666714
AdvancedRunning,ruinawish,Making Hansons Advanced Marathon plan more... advanced,"**Background details:** 30ish, M, aiming for a sub 2:40 marathon in October (PB 2:50 in 2019). Currently at 80km/50mi per week, and will try push into +100km/60mi (coming off two years of niggly injuries). Have previously hit 150km/93mi per week.

I've recently started Hansons advanced marathon plan ([**2018 Summer Series  review on Hansons**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/4twcbg/the_summer_series_hansons/) for those unfamiliar with Hansons). I've previously adapted it loosely with success when training for a marathon and ultramathon.

Hansons has a chapter on 'Schedule modifications' which are all very reasonable: adding to easy runs, running on the rest day, adding to the long run, doubling as you get to 90-100mi. 

My main query is how I can ramp up the tempo runs, and whether I should.

Week | Tempo @MP | Total mileage |
:--:|:--:|:--:
3 | 6mi/10km | 46mi/77km
4 | 6mi/10km | 45mi/75km
5| 6mi/10km | 47mi/80km
6 | 7mi/11km | 47mi/80km
7 | 7mi/11km | 54mi/88km
8 | 7mi/11km | 49mi/82km
9 | 8mi/13km | 57mi/94km
10 | 8mi/13km | 50mi/84km
11| 8mi/13km | 61mi/103km
12 | 9mi/14km | 55mi/89km
13 | 9mi/14km| 62mi/101km
14 | 9mi/14km | 55mi/92km
15 | 10mi/16km | 63mi/103km
16 | 10mi/16km | 56mi/91km
17 | 10mi/16km | 55mi/92km
18 | Race week | 52mi/88km

I've previously done Pfitz-inspired marathon pace runs of up to 18mi/30km previously, often incorporated into the long run. So part of me wants to have my tempo runs in this training block getting near to that distance. The main difference is Hansons is 15 straight weeks of tempo runs, built on the concept of cumulative fatigue; whereas I was making it up as I went along previously.

**Modification ideas:**

* Peak at 13mi/21km-18mi/30km tempo around week 15/16, then taper down the tempo. The idea of the week 17 tempo at 10mi/16km doesn't blow me away.

* That means incrementally ramping up the tempo distance each week, so as to avoid big jumps. I also like the psychological win of achieving a longer tempo run each week.

* If my tempo run goes into the 13mi/21km-18mi/30km range, start incorporating them into the long run.

* Tempo / weekly mileage = 13-15%, so my modifications should match that ratio (though not applicable to a 18mi/30km tempo, so that would have go into the long run). 

It's worth noting that Hansons includes a sample elite plan in their appendix, and modifications of how the elite runners do it. I don't find it that helpful because it varies considerably from the formula of their beginner and advanced plans, i.e. they do a 9 day cycle; the tempo runs are rarely straightforward @MP runs, but instead are often progressive runs; 

Keen to receive any ideas or opinions.

Ultimately, if it gets too hard or too complicated, I'll either go back to the default Advanced program format, or start improvising again (e.g. do a long tempo within the LR, then skip the next week's tempo).",1625656970

AdvancedRunning,eled34,Calf strain treatment,"Hi all,

I am battling chronic calf strains. I genetically have huge calves, which seems to be a blessing and a curse because I keep straining them (left or right) every 3-9 months. 

My guess is that the latest strain (one week ago) came from overtraining / pushing the anaerobic threshold too hard - I felt a clear twinge at the end of a hard, hilly 5 miler. Had been gradually adding 10-15% weekly mileage and was at 35mpw plus cross training.

I gave it 2 days rest then ran 1 mile and had to stop to avoid reaggravation. Then I waited 5 days and ran 2 miles, which felt better, but again had to stop in fear of reaggrivation. I could feel the calf tightening up both times and stopped in my tracks.

I’m wondering if anyone has a good prescription/timeline for treating this? They usually go away in 2-5 days so this one is a bit more severe. Have been foam rolling - also have zero pain while cross training or walking, running is the issue. I have the NYC Marathon in November and really don’t want to jeopardize training but I know rest is probably a necessity for at least another week…

I did have a minor foot injury and Achilles tendinitis that seem to have gone away. I took a little under 2 weeks off after the half marathon on June 19th.

I'm running with a friend that has marathon experience as well, but in slightly less than stellar shape. We ran the half marathon together. He does ok on our training runs but starts to lag when his heart rate gets up there,  then starts wheezing a bit. We did the half in 2:17 with running and walking. I could have done less walking and more running but stuck with my friend throughout. 

The marathon is September 19th. Hopefully there are no setbacks between either of us, but I fear he isn't progressing as well as he should even with some cross training on his bike. We ran 4.5 miles this past Saturday and walked a brief section around 3 miles in.

AdvancedRunning,ngomaam,"Taking a break: What made you take your first extended break from running, and was it worth it?","Since starting regular running in Sept, I haven't really taken a break (running anywhere from 25-40mpw). I missed a day here and there for various reasons, and definitely worked though a lot of lower leg issues (both knees, ankle, calves), but never had to take an extended break to let my body rest/heal. All those lower leg issues are gone now for the most part.

I'm contemplating taking my first extended break (more than a week) due to a nagging groin/adductor issue that developed a month ago. I can still run, but after every run, even easy ones, my affected leg just feels weak (and warming up takes a while, I'm limp-running for a bit). And the groin issue never goes away, I constantly massage/foam roll but it doesn't seem to do much. I feel it while even just walking sometimes, esp after a run or in the morning. 

I'm ready to take a break but what I'm worried about is that I'll take a break, only to find out the issue remains. I've also contemplated seeing a physical therapist to help work through this issue.

**Training**

Coming to the conclusion of a long track season I have been in a 21 day sharpening / taper zone as I compete in championship season races. The past weeks have included conference (8/16/32), regionals (16/32), states (16/32), and nationals (5k). 

Through early June I maintained between 60 miles per week with a dedicated low volume explosive day. This workout emphasized lateral movements, plyometrics, bounding, and sprint mechanics. I ran an additional one or two workouts depending on the presence of a race. A typical no-race week might be explosive Monday, an aerobic workout, such as 8 x 1000m at 10k pace (3:10/km) on Wednesday, and 2 miles at threshold (~10:20) followed by 6 x 300 at mile pace (:48s) on Friday. Saturdays are long runs, typically 12-14 miles at 6:30-45 pace/mile. Sundays alternate between a rest day and a mix of 4-5 miles light with cross training. 

In the week leading up to the race I was attempting to both recover from my 1 second PR (4:11) in the mile on June 25 and prepare for the 5k, a distance which I have not raced nor target trained for in 8 months. The highlight of the week was 4 x 600 at 5k pace (1:48) followed by a speedy 500-300-100 cutdown four days out. Two days out, I ran on Pre’s Trail (5 miles) which is a big cross off of the bucket list. 

**Race**

Eugene was still recovering from the record heatwave, although conditions had improved slightly. At start time, I was faced with clear skies and 80 degrees F temperatures. As to be expected in a high school race, the field took off too fast, so I stayed near last place for a few laps. This was still enough to earn my fastest split of the race, a 2:56 first kilometer. At this point in the race, I knew that other runners would start to “go to sleep” and/or pay for their ambitious start. Throughout kilometers two and three I steadily moved up through the field. The temperature had been climbing steadily and multiple athletes had already passed out or stepped off. 

Consideration was also taken to the rail, as many of us were not used to having an  inside rail and were stumbling. With 2k to go, I made an effort to reconnect to the front of the chase pack to set up a successful final 1600m. This is where the race started to hurt for me. At what felt like maximum exertion, I was only hanging on to pace and certainly not making up ground on the leaders. Despite this, hearing the bell and knowing I was on pace to break 15 minutes helped me to close in 67 seconds.  

**Analysis**
Although I missed the top 6, and with that coveted All American status, I was extremely pleased with my time. This was my first 5k not on a cross country course, where my PR lay in the mid 15’s. Additionally, while I have a good aerobic base through good training load and V02 max workouts, most of my training has targeted mid distance for the last 3 months. 

As mentioned in the title, this was my last race of high school, making it especially bittersweet. I am currently writing this back on the East coast with my toes in the ocean on recovery week. Looking forward, I will be running division 1 cross country and am excited to start my summer training soon!",1625583041

# Training:

I’m a 25 year old make who had run intermittently, but without any real distance-work (mainly the weekly 5km) on and off for 2020, a year after I stopped playing football at a semi-pro level in Australia. So this was my first ever training block in running and began at the start of February and ended up being continually prolonged and set back as the SMH Half Marathon was itself set back thanks to *youknowwhat*. The plan followed was a HR-based intermediate half-marathon program provided within Garmin Connect. It basically consisted of five days of running. Two easy days of about 45 minutes of running, two day of speed-work whether that be threshold sessions or interval training and then a long run to round out the week on Sunday. Mileage maxed out at about 65km per week.  Some key workouts that gave me pre-race confidence included:

# Pre-race:

Three days before the race, a COVID outbreak in Sydney cancelled the event, but hey, I get free entry next year. I should also note that most of my training had been fasted so the race too, I entered with just some coffee and water in my system. Maybe I could improve on this,  but I just went with what I knew I was comfortable with.

# Race: 

So I still wanted to test my fitness and picked my next day completely off work to do so. I chose an area - the Olympic Park - down here where I had logged a fair few of my training runs and set off at with my goal pace of 4:00min/km in mind.  

**Kilometres 1-10:**  Pretty quickly, I settled into a decent pace, under my goal pace of 4:00min/km. I thought I might pay for this later on, having never raced this distance but also knew that if I wanted to tick off my goals, I’d have to come under that pre-determined pace anyway. Overall effort was at a 6 or 7 out of 10 at this time.  

**Kilometres 10-16:**  My pacing strategy was to keep things under control till the 16-kilometre or 10-mile mark and then send it for the final 5km. But these kilometres particularly from 12-15 seemed the most mentally taxing. I had to remain focused and it was tough. RPE was probably moving into an 8 or so and while the legs felt good, the mind was fatiguing. Oh, I also took a gel at kilometre 15, for peace of mind more than anything else, I’d say.  

**Kilometres 16-21.1**:  The final 5km push. I had been warned that effort levels would go through the roof, and if you were lucky, you;’d be able to maintain pace, rather than actually speed up. This seemed pretty bang on in my experience. I focused hard on remaining consistent with my breathing and simply taking quicker more frequent steps. I knew my average pace was a fair bit quicker than I had anticipated but not exactly where it would land me, so just tried my hardest to really leave it all out there in the final kilometre. Coming in in just under 1:21:00 with some wobbly legs!

# Post-race

I let myself catch my breath for a few moments, took it in, cracked a smile and headed off to cool down, stretch and grab some Nuun. Nothing crazy really, and now sort of just trying to figure out what is next I guess. I know I love running. But to go for distance and the marathon?

AdvancedRunning,Ptyix,How abnormal is my progress after 4 months?,"I mean abnormally bad, lol. Not kidding. (Sorry for posting here as casual beginner, I'd just like to see what more experienced runners say.)

I realize this is difficult or impossible to really evaluate, I just mean a rough assessment.

- 32m, no particular health issues known, in normal weight range, some recreational athletic experience in the past, last 5 years almost completely inactive, non-smoker.

- On average ran about 3-4 times a week, 30-60 minutes. A variety of run-and-walk, continuous running up to 90 minutes, shorter runs, some barefoot indoor runs, some rare strides. Had to pause a few times a couple of days due to some minor foot pain. Didn't follow any specific training plan, mostly trying to aim for aerobic base.

- I'd say my hr max is around 198 (might be off, based on observations/equations).

- Ran 75k last month, 10,7 hours. (No data for previous months.)

- First tracked run a month ago was 5,2k in 45:44. After first k in 8:35 my hr was 162. Average hr 159, max 173.

- Last week ran 5k in 42 min, about 8:28 per k. After first k my hr was 155. Average hr 147.

- About a week ago I ran 10k in 1:27, setting pace so that hr stays around 130 (70% of what I then thought was my hr max).

- Today ran 4,2k in 38:33. After first k in 8:06 hr was 161. Then slowed to around 9:25, average hr still 153, max 167... hmm.

All based on Huawei Band 4 Pro sensors, often with non-available GPS/internal tracker instead. hr numbers seem reasonable enough, around 160 my breathing definitely indicates it's not a proper easy run pace any more.

Even considering mistakes (running consistently too fast maybe, no cross training or additional exercises), this seems exceptionally bad after almost 4 months. Is this some outlier level of bad? Am I some kind of biomolecular anomaly?",1625444528
AdvancedRunning,steve1138,Advice on Achilles Injury,"Background: I am 29 years old. Ran XC in high school and college.  Took a few years off, then started running again a couple years ago. 

I have had Achilles pain while running since the end of April.  It has also flared up occasionally over the last few years.  This is not my first time with Achilles difficulties since i started running again a couple years ago, but these are my most severe and long lasting difficulties.  I was never injured at all in high school or college.

When I first starting hurting in of April/early May I would start pretty stiff during runs and then it would loosen up after a mile or two, and then would start hurting more sharply around mile 6 or 7.  It wasn't getting better so I took a week and a half off in May.  I then started building up relatively slowly with 20-30 mile weeks (down from 60ish previously in April).  I thought it was getting better, but then after just a couple weeks of 30ish miles a week, it started hurting again (starting stiff and getting actually pain about 6 miles in).  I then went to see a physical therapist who suggested no running, icing my ankle twice a day, doing ankle stability exercises.  I have rested completely with no running the last three weeks. It doesn't hurt at all when just walking around or anything, but is occasionally sore when or after doing eccentric heel drops. 

Just recently, after three weeks totally off, the physical therapist suggested I try jogging again to test.  I ran half a mile yesterday and a mile today. I still feel similar stiffness/soreness in my Achilles.  No intense pain.  I kind of have a feeling that it may not have improved despite three weeks off.

I am curious to hear about other people's experience with Achilles pain. How long does it last? Even if there is no ""pain, are you still aware of it when you start running again/increasing mileage?  I was hoping to hear people's thoughts on my next steps. I am seeing the physical therapist again in a week.  Jog a mile or two a day and see if it just needs to get used to running again?  Go back to no running?  My current PT seems generally knowledgable, but knows very little about running. When do you think I should try going to someone else?

Thanks!",1625438259

\### Training

Atlanta Track Club puts on these fun come-one-come-all track meets earlier in the spring, so I had been running 50-60mpw doing tempo and interval training for 3k and 5k, running some fast times and having fun in the process. After the last race in early June, I buckled up for some half marathon and 10k pace work in preparation for the Peachtree. 

Some key sessions that made me feel prepared: 

* [Modified 1600/800 Michigan workout](https://www.strava.com/activities/5510323886), closing the last 800 in 2:26
* [8x1k @ goal 10k pace](https://www.strava.com/activities/5479137087), 90s rest, even splits for 5:20/mile pace
* [6xmile @ threshold pace,](https://www.strava.com/activities/5526380651) 60s rest, feeling smooth

I tend to convince myself to train through races, which isn't super effective given I haven't been racing much through the pandemic, so I gave myself a full week taper, which definitely paid off. Going into the race, I knew I was in good shape to attack my PR, but the Peachtree course has a notorious ""V"" elevation profile, where the late-race pain and hills drain your legs. I also treated myself to some Vaporflys for a little back-pocket confidence. 

\### Pre-race

Woke up at 4:30am and downed two cups of coffee before taking public transit to the start line. I squeezed in a mile jog and then did a few drills while meeting friends at the start line. The Peachtree is always fun because if you're lucky enough to get in the first start wave, you warm up with the elite field. This year's lineup was excellent, so I had to contain myself doing drills next to Jake Riley, Galen Rupp, Sara Hall, and the like. 

\### Race

There were an insane number of people in the first heat and I made the mistake of getting smushed to the side, so I was trying to move and get around people for a hot minute. Came through the first mile 15 seconds slower than expected, so I picked it up a little, which wasn't risky as the next two miles are completely downhill. At this point, I enjoyed the excitement of racing and how much the Vaporflys smoothed the downhill pounding. 

My family cheered me on around the third mile, which is bittersweet as I appreciate their support, but their positioning means the hills are coming. Came through 5k in 16:40 so I knew I still had a shot at a PR and at least knew I had some wiggle room for the hills. The key to the course is realizing that the first two hills are nasty, then the following hills are much shallower with a mostly downhill last mile. So I gritted my teeth and tried to balance between slowing too much and overworking my legs. I also pulled away from a pack here and got strung out between a few people. 

From here, I was very familiar with the course and just focused on picking off people and maintaining pace. The cheater shoes definitely worked their magic because my legs felt a lot less beat up than I expected them to at this point. For the uninitiated, the Peachtree follows along Peachtree Street for the first \~5.5 miles, then turns onto another road for a mostly downhill finish. As soon as I hit the turn, I started the kick, knowing it would be painfully long, but mercifully downhill. I passed one guy and fought him off for the finish, which was enough to secure sub 33:30 and a big PR!

\### Post-race

That post-race mix of pain, relief, and satisfaction hits different. Once again, the Peachtree rewards the fast start wave at the finish as you get to see the elites giving their post race interviews. We spotted Rupp and Mike Smith sulking away after his third mediocre 10k in the past month lol... 

Met up with some friends for cooldown and jogged around Piedmont Park. Recapped the race at a friends apartment over waffles and beer then prepared for the inevitable midday caffeine/booze/race crash.

Very excited to come away with a PR after a year of meh pandemic training, as I think many can relate to. Hopefully I'll have another opportunity this summer or fall to chase sub 33 on a flatter course. Hopefully this inspires some of you to check out the United State's biggest 10k and one of the most fun races I've ever done!",1625435674

**Background**

I have always loved running and started training more seriously September 2020, when I signed up for a full Marathon. I figured 4-5 months of training was going to allow me to build my base and finish it without walking and under 4 hours. However, after my first daughter was born in January my training went out the window. I wasn't getting much sleep, I was lacking motivation... so I ended up downgrading to a HM. I completed the race with little training hoping to break 2 hours, I blew up in the second half during lack of training and going out too fast, but was able to barely break 2 hours by less than a minute. After the race I decided to sign up for the Peachtree and I set as a goal to train well for the 10K, which is a distance I feel comfortable with and I have ran plenty of times. I wanted to start building up my base but suffered from Achilles tendon issues and shin splints, I was really starting to struggle thinking that I was never going to be able to build up my mileage. I slowed down my easy runs and started a building plan from Pfitzinger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Training**

I did the 12/30 Pfitzinger building phase after a marathoner friend recommended it and put a lot of emphasis on actually building my mileage without going balls to the wall on every run, which I believe that has been the source of most of my injuries. First weeks felt great and given that the plan increases the mileage gradually I kept feeling amazing as the miles went up and remained injury free. I hit 30mpw a month away from the race and hit 34mpw the week before, I didn't tapper as most of my miles were super easy at a very comfortable pace. Given that most of my miles were slow I wanted to do some sort of tune up workout the week of the race (I decided on Tuesday to have 5 days of rest) to see how my legs felt so I did 5 repeats of 1-mile @ 10K target pace with 90 seconds resting. I surprised myself and was able to run all the repeats under 7:05, even though my target pace was 7:15. I felt really confident given that I put in the work but still had the nerves of not having run under 45 mins before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-race**

Start time was 6:30am so woke up at 4:00am to eat some oats with half a banana and a cup of coffee. I pulled up YouTube and watched some Kipchoge inspirational videos just to get me hyped for the race. My father in law picked us up and dropped us off close to the start line at 5:40am. It gave me a little under an hour to jog a mile, get the mandatory porta potty break and some strides. I went up to my wave start where I was going to meet with my marathoner friend that recommended me the Pfitzinger plan. He is coming out of an injury so he offered to be my personal pacer to go sub 45, what a great guy he is. I went over a million strategies on my head and decided to stick to a slight negative split, which was going to be challenging because the first half is downhill and the second half has a couple of hills and it's flat for the rest of the course including a decent downhill in the last half mile on the way to the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

**Race**

*Miles 1-3 (7:23 - 7:00 - 7:01)*

My plan was to start the first mile at around 7:20, which is a comfortable pace to put me in a great spot to run a negative split. It was my first time running it and rumors say that most people go all out in the first 3 miles and hit a wall when the hills start. I was right on the number in my first mile, zigzagging through people. Miles 2 and 3 were downhill (73ft and 116ft according to Strava) and I tried holding back because I was going below 7:00/mi without realizing it. I was right on the numbers for the two miles and felt great building up to the second half of the race.

*Miles 4-5 (7:06 - 7:02)*

Here is where the race started for me, I worked through the hills trying to stay at around 7:10/mi and would take advantage of the flatter parts. Around 110ft of elevation in these two miles and it was a struggle staying below the goal pace. Getting close to mile 5 I started to feel my legs feeling heavy, so the mental battle started. My friend was feeling great so focusing on keeping up with him got me going. I kept repeating to myself how hard I have been training and how it was time to just execute and push through it because it would be well worth it at the end. Gotta love when we become our own mental coaches!

*Miles 6-finish (6:43 - 1:35)*

Time to close out this damn race and break the 45 minute barrier (for all the people that said I was crazy for attempting a PR at this course), that is what got me going! I still have no idea how I got the kick to run mile 6 at that pace, thinking about the finish line was probably it. I was hurting, my chest was on fire but I wasn't going to hold back anything, it was time to empty the tank! I took advantage of the final half mile being downhill so got my kick going and when there was about 200m to go my friend move to the side and said ""It's all you man!"". Pulled a final sprint to the finish line to not only break 45 minutes but also 44 and I was ecstatic!

**Unofficial time:** 43:49 PR!!!

**Overall:** 839 out of 24,601 (at the moment of writing this)

**M25-29:** 90 out of 974 (at the moment of writing this)

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-race**

I was so excited I didn't know what to do when I finished! I grabbed a water and took some sips to stay hydrated as I didn't drink anything throughout the race and ate a coconut almond bar that they gave us at the end. I stayed around the finish line with a couple of friends waiting for my wife to come in. She ran without any training whatsoever and 6-months postpartum and was able to go sub 65 mins, so she is today's real hero! We went to a nearby restaurant, had a breakfast sandwich with tots and lots of water. Took a nice hot shower to sink in this personal accomplishment, wrote this long novel while I still have the race fresh in my mind and now it's time to enjoy the 4th with some friends.

I wanted to try running after biking (thinking about doing a triathlon) and so I started running immediately after getting off my bike.

As soon as I started running (on a downhill) I felt a pretty strong pain in both knees, which gradually subsided, but didn’t go away completely, for my 40 minute run. 

Since then, the outside of my right knee has been pretty sore. Going down stairs usually causes increased pain, and I can’t run very far without it being too much to bear. Running uphill is especially rough. The pain is felt on the outside of my knee and is worst when bringing my leg forward. 

After trying to run, the pain is more intense for the next day or two, and bending my knee hurts. I basically have to walk around with a straightened right knee to avoid pain.

I’ve been able to do pretty much every other type of exercise except run (bodyweight cardio, biking, lifting), but running is my favorite by far and I want to be able to get back to it as quickly as possible.

I’m thinking I either have an LCL tear, a meniscus tear, or possibly (though less likely) ITBS. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on what they think my injury is, a better way to diagnose it, and/or the best way to recover from it as quickly as possible?

Thanks in advance!",1625411215
AdvancedRunning,RegulusDeneb,Taking Breaks During Long Runs," I am training for my first marathon and have moved to a new area, so I am training with groups that are new to me. They all take breaks during the long run, whether to socialize or hydrate at water stops. None of the folks I have running with carry their water. My preference is to carry my water and keep running with may just a brief break at the turnaround.   

What is your preference? I do feel faster after taking a brief walking break in a race, but for training, it seems like it would be better to keep the circulatory system working at the level it needs to to run. Does it decrease the effectiveness of the workout to stand and talk for 1 or 2 minutes every few miles, or for a few minutes after 5 or 6 miles?

I've recently amped up the miles (as a novice).  
I've a fitness test coming up for law enforcement (not America), and I've been doing the beep test, now coupled with some road running and cycling, plus some gym/weights work.

I went for a 5k yesterday, first time without stopping (which isn't great but oh well), I felt some discomfort as expected and some sharp pains in my left foot behind the base of the 5th metatarsal (the boney bit on the outside of your foot).  
So it's originating from a spot deep in my foot between that boney spot and my heel.

Today it was far worse, it got worse the more I walked on it, probably wasn't the smartest thing to do but I was working.

I'm hobbling around the place, can't put weight on it, can't walk properly never mind run.  
It's constantly dull and aches, if I walk on it I get sharp pains with each step/push off.  
It's also sore to touch on that spot (Cuboid I'm guess I really don't know).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I went for an X-Ray, which was inconclusive.  
They said it probably wouldn't show anyway.

Said it could be a stress fracture or tendonitis.  
If it's still like this in a week comeback.  


In the mean time I just have to keep off my foot, ice it, anti-inflammatories and I've been told no running.

Can tendonitis be this bad?  
I've had patella tendonitis and that was uncomfortable but not debilitating..

I was working today (on my feet from 7-2) and I have a feel that exacerbated things.

I hope it's not a stress fracture, because I know that'll mean more time not training..

Anyone been in a similar predicament?  


Or can anyone just fill me in on how Tendonitis and Stress Fractures feel/present differently?

I'm not asking for medical advice - just opinions/anecdotes..

I'm leaving the actual diagnosis up to the professionals.

I'm off work until next weekend with it so I have time to rest.

AdvancedRunning,jaketuber,Nike Pegasus 36 Replacement?,"I love almost everything about the Pegasus 36 - it's light, neutral, has a thin, breathable upper that's great for humidity and rain, and fits snug on my feet. I just finished putting 900 miles on my fourth pair of them... so you could say I like them. I've used them for easy runs and long runs for the past several training cycles. Unfortunately, the supply of them from outlets and online stores has dried up and I feel like I have to find an alternative. I highly disliked the 37, I thought it was too maximalist, the fit was sloppy, and whoever decided it should have a huge puffy upper should be fired. The replacement shoe doesn't need to be Nike, in fact it would be nice to switch to a more forward-thinking brand. However, I do like having a sleek looking shoe and lots of other trainers out there now (I'm looking at you Mizuno Waverider) are fugly. More of a secondary ask, but something easy on the wallet would also be nice - I run a decent amount and I don't like paying $150 for a pair of new trainers every 3 months.

AdvancedRunning,JadenCyjJN,Anyone here also has hydration issues?,"Hi Running friends, I'm a constant runner and I also keep getting this weird hydration issue. I made this post to share my experience and also seek some answers or tips from you guys.

This happens when you gulp too much water at once and your body actually keeps the water in your stomach EVEN after 4 hours (might even be 5 hours) but im sure it doesnt exceed 6 hours. If it does then i suggest visiting a doctor. This makes my long runs hard because *obviously* a heavy stomach with the constant shaking of the body due to running, this will cause a very uncomfortable ""Puking"" sensation in your stomach since the water is shaking so much. You can identify this situation simply by during warmup, just shake your stomach or do some On The Spot jogging, and if you hear *Water Sloshing Sounds* in your stomach then you know your stomach is so called ""Heavy"" and ""full of water"". Sure you can run but you won't get far or fast. The sensation of water is horrible. Imagine trying to increase pace and you start hearing water sloshing noises from your stomach and then the feeling of puking.

How this came about. I've experimented this many many times and the results are quite shocking and amazing. 

Basically I usually run at about 6pm everyday for my long runs. Even at 1 - 2pm, if you take a HUGE Gulp of water, even a Can of soda or drink, if you drink the whole thing in like 2 mins, the liquid will stay in your stomach EVEN at 6pm. Yes, it stays there even after so many hours. You can try it out yourself too. Drink a huge gulp and huge amount of water in a short time at 2pm, then at 6pm shake your body around to agitate the contents of your stomach. You *should* hear a lot of water sloshing sounds.

What i found out that works and also proposed by my Running Coach, is that drinking Small Constant Sips of water is better than a huge gulp. I've done many research about this too and it has shown that Gulp is not good for the body because you are taking in so much water that your kidneys cannot excrete water as fast as you are taking in. Hence causing the water staying in your stomach. You may think, hey maybe the kidney can excrete the water in your stomach after 1 -2 hours. The weird fact is, no. But eventually yes. I've tried drinking sips for hours and hours before my runs and maybe about 1 - 2 hours before my run i drink less sips. It works, and the right way your stomach should feel before running is a light stomach (Almost empty). And when you shake your stomach no sound should be produced. Even Eliud Kipchoge has mentioned he likes a Light Stomach when he runs so he can be faster so he avoids excessive amounts of foods or water before a session. Yesterday at about 1.30 - 2pm, i drank down a whole Can of Chocolate drink, and then at 6pm i hear a huge amount of water sloshing in my stomach. I was quite shocked too... but i see it as normal as i've experienced it many times.

I hope this post is somehow informational and helped some people. But I wanna ask those who are more experienced than me for their opinions, on this topic. 

Summary of my concerns
1. Is it true that water actually stays in your stomach EVEN after so many hours (Caused by Gulping a lot of water in a short time) ?
2. Is there a better solution to this?
3. Anyone has a explanation of this?

AdvancedRunning,ItsAllChemistry,changed training routine and I think I am regressing,"I have been running for about 5 years but only in the last 2, I approach it with an 'advanced' mindset. I hired a coach who followed Jack Daniels approach and I started significantly improving. During the lockdowns, I bought JD's book and continued alone by following his 5k-10k plans and improved even more. For the reference, I [50M] went from 26:56 to 22:40 (for 5k) in those 2 years.

I now joined a local club and they train on the track. They also have a coach who leads a very good group of youngsters and he also provides a training plan for us seniors. I really enjoy the track but I find out that my endurance is regressing while my speed is improving. This weekend I raced 10k and the wheels came off after 5k. I got completely broken and was nowhere near my planned 10k pace in the 2nd half of the race. Strangely enough, I managed to speed up significantly during the last 0.5 mile when it felt as if I was on the track :-).   

My problem is that I just got used to JD's terminology and I was really enjoying his T workouts. The new plan by the club's coach is full of workouts with all kinds of repeats at paces like 10k, or 5k, or 3k, or 80% of 10k etc. So, I can not really work out the correct pace and most likely I run workouts too fast. 
When it comes to the track workouts, I can hold paces really well and feel good after the workout but these paces are faster than JD's I and R paces. So, I am a bit lost and can not really understand the purpose of the workouts. Also, I have a feeling that track workouts build my speed, but my endurance suffers.

I enjoy the track and the people I run with, so I do not want to leave the club. Would it be OK if I run the track with the group and then run a familiar JD's T session as my second weekly workout?
Or trust the process and have faith in the new coach, but reduce my paces (if yes to this, how much slower do I go)?  
BTW, he spends his time coaching youngsters and I do not want to bother him (or maybe even insulting him) with my questions/doubts. He has been coaching for 20+years and had some really successful career, so I am pretty sure that he knows what is he talking about. However, I did notice that I am regressing.

## Training

After the 5000m race on May 15th started bit by bit transitioning to faster workouts. More 200m, 400m repeats. Only 3 weeks before the TT started doing more specific training for 1500m. 10x400m, 15x400m, and so on. But it wasn't a big preparation, and I don't have lots of speed training in me at all. We planned for 1:12 per lap.

## Race

Went out way too hard. First lap - 1:08. As I haven't run longer than 400m at this speed I started feeling that I've passed the 400m mark already. Or maybe it's my mind playing tricks on me. My second lap was 1:13, so still not bad. Then I slowed down miserably. My third lap was 1:17. It was 300m left so I started pushing again. I ran like I haven't run already 1200m. Kicked with \~150m left. If my first lap had been slower, I could've managed other laps better and with a kick run 28 high probably. Fell down on my knees after.

## Post-race

It went by pretty fast. It's pain, but not the same as 5k pain so it's hard to compare them. Now as I have a base time I can work on my speed and expect 4:20 in the near future. I'm happy with my time. Now through summer, I expect great progress.",1625064960

I'm at a point in my life where I want to accomplish big things, and I'm fortunate enough to have a lot of time and energy to dedicate to running. 

So I'd love to hear some of your favorite marginal gains. What are minor adjustments you've made in your life that alone make a fraction of a difference, but when combined with other changes can make a large impact? A simple example would be polishing up your sleep routine to allow deeper sleep. (An eye mask, doing research on what sleeping position works best for you, setting the right temperature at night, and proper device usage) 

Alternatively, is there a giant resource you'd recommend for this? A trusted site that breaks down all topics that indirectly impact running. I'm a total geek and love optimizing everything :)",1625015054
AdvancedRunning,Davidlikesboys,Random very bad training days,"I usually can run 7 miles at about 7:30 pace pretty comfortably, but today I literally ran 4 miles at 7:40 with like 5 breaks.

AdvancedRunning,catman007,Heart Rate Concern,"Hey all! Some quick background: I’m a 28 year old male, who ran cross country in high school and still stays relatively fit to this day, although I run way less than I used to.

I always see graphs of other people’s heart rates and they can maintain a steady rate - I can’t seem to do that, even if I take it easy on a run. Mine always ends up going up noticeably at a mile or so and I often spend 22-24 minutes of a 30 minute run in heart rate zone 4 of 5, even if I’m not trying to. 

Am I that out of shape, or should I take an even easier pace? For reference, my Max heart rate is about 200 and I average 180 in a 30 minute run.",1625008748
AdvancedRunning,westphillyghost,"For all the beginner runners dealing with heat, SLOW DOWN!","Hello all,

I’m hoping that putting some real numbers to some recent runs I’ve done will help show beginner or novice runners that summer heat can drastically alter their running efforts, paces and recovery

Background: 31M recreational runner for the past 16 years. I’ve done nothing earth shattering but I’ve been running long enough to have learned many lessons along the way. I’d say right now, I’m in about 5:15-5:30 mile shape and overall am a distance rather than a speed runner

Earlier this spring, I returned from a running break and started getting back into running shape. I regularly used a heart rate monitor (chest strap) to keep an eye on my running efforts in accordance with the days agenda. I regularly run 35-45mpw and my easy paces when the weather was cooler ranged from 7:20-7:40 depending on other factors. These paces were the average pace when my heart rate was between 140-160bpm. I usually like to keep around 150bpm for easy runs and 140 for recovery runs.

This past week has become full summertime where I’m at, with temp ranges of 90-95F and 50% humidity on average. I sometimes have the option of running later at night around 8pm but don’t really have an option to run early as I work early as an RN. 

Such as it is, I decided to do a few runs this week on my days off when it was 90+ degrees out to start some heat acclimatization. The average pace I’m able to keep while keeping my heart rate at an easy effort was 8:35min/mile!

This usually feels like a slow, recovery effort for me but alas, it feels way different now

I figured I would throw out some real numbers for those wondering just how much you have to slow down in the summer. Hopefully this is helpful for a few people out there",1624999173

AdvancedRunning,vsbuffalo,Running changed my life... but how do I keep doing it for the next few decades?,"I'm a 34M that started running for real (after lots of starts and stops) in January. For the first time, I'm really addicted and it's sticking (and doing runs ≥5 miles was largely the reason why). Running 15-20 miles a week has completely stopped migraines I've had for 20 years that would require medication, I've lost 14lbs, my fitness is now much higher, so needless to say, it's the most important step I've taken for my physical and mental health.... ever. 

My main concern is that my knees will prevent me from running over the next decades of my life. I have had a right patellar dislocation in the past, and hit by a car while biking on the other knee (but this was minor and PT helped) — honestly, I think chronic sitting contributed more to my knee issues than these injuries. Anxiety around knee pain has kept me wary of running in the past, but stepping up the mileage 10% / week has actually made my knees \*stronger\* through time. I still get random, temporary bouts of pain during a run (especially during warmup) that usually go away after a few meters. For full context, I've found my left hamstring is chronically tighter than the right (e.g. with dynamic stretch kicks, I can never raise it as high), and stretch my hamstrings in a doorframe and stretch quads usually helps with the pain.

I've read studies saying that running being bad for knees is a myth (being sedentary is worse), but (1) when should I be concerned, and (2) what are the top strength training or stretches I must do to maintain healthy knees for running over the next few decades?

AdvancedRunning,NotTheTrueKing,Constant feeling that I'm overstriding even though form/cadence says otherwise,"Hey y'all. I've been coming back to regular running after a year or so off. Before this, I was a pretty regular runner for the past 6 years and, while running was painful, I didn't ever really feel like my body was out of sync or something. However, since starting up again recently, I've had this constant feeling like I'm overstriding and having to pull my body forwards, especially later in runs when my form gets worse and I start to lose my lean. At the same time, my cadence is a constant 180-190 SPM regardless of pace and I seem to be landing relatively above my center of gravity. This effect is especially pronounced in shoes with higher drops (8-10 mm), which are coincidentally the main types I've been running in since 2018. I don't feel this as much in the one zero drop shoe I own, but I can't help but think it's a placebo since I tend to run slower in those as well. Could this feeling actually be attributable to something like shoe drop or has anyone experienced something similar?",1624965626

AdvancedRunning,theotherwhitehead,No love for Phil Maffetone? (Simple calculation to see if MAF is right for you).,"I ran a search on this sub/forum for “Phil Maffetone” and the “MAF method.” What I found is that many athletes dismiss this method because, among other reasons, they worry that they are training too slowly. There is a simple calculation to determine for yourself if you would benefit from spending some time running “too slowly.”

MAF, Philip Maffetone alleges, stands for Maximum Aerobic Function. (It just happens to correspond to the first three letters of his last name.)

 In short, the MAF method is a heartrate monitoring training approach that emphasizes running at an intensity level that is approximately between 78-83% of maximum heartrate (my estimates). Rather than ask athletes to conduct demanding HR-max tests and perform tedious calculations, Maffetone has offered a simple guide: subtract your age from 180 and voila: your ceiling for MAF. For example, as a 35yo, 180-35=145 beats per minute. Maffetone would advise me to keep the majority of my runs between 135-145 bpm. (There are small adjustments that can be made based on fitness and health. I am healthy and have averaged 50mpw for 12 years, so I add 5 beats per minute. My new ceiling is 150 bpm; my adjusted range is 140-150).

Many athletes find that this intensity level (78-83% HRmax) corresponds with a pace that seems too slow (the author of this post finds it a bit fast; more on this below). Maffetone (and other coaches who emphasize aerobic conditioning) argue that there are gains to be had at this (allegedly) low intensity. Indeed, if this intensity level seems awkwardly slow to an athlete, then said athlete likely stands to gain much from training at MAF. (If you think MAF is slow, be advised that John “Hadd” Walsh, by comparison, recommends the majority of training be spent at 70-75%HRmax, and twice-weekly workbouts in the 83-88% range.)

There is a simple test to see if an athlete would benefit from binging on MAF exercise (i.e., spending 4-6 months training within the MAF zone). Compare your IAAF scores across race distances. Thankfully, there is a calculator that will do this for you (so you don’t have to scroll through thousands of pages of spreadsheets to find your scores). https://caltaf.com/pointscalc/calc.html
Here are my values:

Distance	         Time		IAAF score
Mile:		          4:44		602
5K (road): 	15:49		666
10K (road):	33:50		656
15K (road):	51:10		701
Half marathon:1:13:10	        705

Notice how my IAAF scores get larger as the race distance increases. (I am a classic slow-twitch runner.) Looking at my training, you would (rightly) say that I would benefit from anaerobic intervals OR faster training runs, depending on which race time I wanted to improve (middle distance or 25K+). Since I have been following the Hadd method (which advocates running even slower than MAF for the majority of runs), then switching to MAF means increasing the my intensity across the board, and (hopefully) improving my shorter distances. Notice: following MAF has my running faster than usual, not slower.

If, when you run your IAAF numbers, the value gets lower as the race distance increases, then this means that you have poor aerobic training. If this is the case, then you would benefit from spending time at MAF (or even slower, in the author’s opinion). If your IAAF numbers get bigger as the race distance increases, then you can increase the intensity of your workouts/easy runs.

You will see from the numbers above that I am not slow. I’m not racing in the Olympic trials, but I win a lot of local races. When I compare my average training pace with my local running club, however, I am one of the slowest runners in the city. I run the majority of my miles at 70-75% HRM (which is about 10-15 bpm lower than the MAF number), and this corresponds to about 7:40 min/mile in the winter and 8:20 m/m in the summer. MAF, by comparison, is currently 6:25 in the winter and 6:45 in the summer. That’s generally too fast for a daily pace, but look at how weak my mile and 5K times are compared to my 15K and half marathon. I could probably benefit from increasing the pace of my easy runs (which I’m now doing) and adding more frequent strides.

I have more to say about how to maximize MAF (such as getting a quality HR-monitor strap), but will wait and first see the vitriol roused by this post.",1624904478

### Training
I'd been running a pretty consistent 35-40 mpw over the past year with no target races, just spinning my wheels in a general Daniels framework (similar to the 5-week marathon cycles plan) and waiting for an interesting in-person race to pop up. Decided to run the Blue Moon Trail Series (5k, 8k, 10k) on a lark about two weeks ahead of the first race. Despite no real prep or taper, took 6th overall with a 22:31 in the 5k, which I'm happy with. I know it's dumb to shoot for a finishing place, especially when it depends so much on few *actually* fast people showing up, but my goal was to do better in the 8k. After the 5k, kept my training mostly the same with 2 workouts (reps or intervals and a tempo) per week, easy runs, and weekend long runs. Mileage crept up to 45 mpw before a little race week taper.

### Pre-race
Got an email the week of the race saying trail maintenance forced the 8k to be rerouted. Might be more like an 8.5k now. No big deal, right? Weather was cooler than expected with a thunderstorm looming. That's evening in Colorado for you. Got a mile warmup in, some dynamic stretching, some strides, felt decent but not great. Wind felt a bit chilly as I lined up at the start, but I knew I'd be grateful for it once I started running. Race director reiterated that the course was well-marked and course marshals would be there to provide direction.

### Race
Felt strong as we set off toward the nasty first hill. Counted 5 people ahead of me with the rest of the pack pretty far back. Adrenaline kept me going up the hill without too much slowing, and I passed a guy on the downhill. By the end of the first mile I was in 5th place and entirely alone, with no chance at catching up with the front-runners and very comfortably ahead of everyone else. I focused on holding back a bit over the next two miles, since they had some wicked hills and I knew I'd have a couple miles to go after the climbs. Finished the 5k loop with some reserves intact and ready to attack the last 3k. Pace was a bit off for a sub-38 time, but I'd make it up with a fast finish. Course marshals pointed me toward the loop that finishes the 8k and I started picking up the pace.

Okay, there's the closed-off section of trail with signs pointing the way for the race re-route. Awesome. But then... a fork with no flags telling me which way to go. I went right. Wrong choice. Trail dumped me out in a neighborhood. Doubled back and almost got caught by the 6th-place dude, but I managed to put some distance between us once I was back on track. Oh look, there are some flags up ahead at another fork... but they don't actually tell me which path to take. Uh oh. Go left this time? 4th mile had clicked by now, and I was starting to see other runners. We were passing each other going the opposite direction, shrugging our shoulders and saying we're not sure where we're going. A couple other lost runners turned around and started following me. Hey look, more flags! And they're indicating we should turn around and go back the way we came? That's the consensus, so the three of us did it. Still hoping to save the race, I kept pace up a hill as the other two guys started to drop back... and then they were gone. Apparently they took a turn I didn't see. I was alone again, 5 miles into an 8k, with no idea where to go.

5.45 miles in, I stopped my watch in frustration. After walking for a bit, I found a trail marker and re-started my watch. Jogged for a mile before stopping my watch again. I was completely lost. And then... another runner! Older guy, walking. It turned out he was a bit injured, so I walked with him as a downpour started. We walked for another mile or so (according to his watch; I was too mad to turn mine back on, Garmin was *not* going to record the way this race finished!) until finding ourselves in familiar territory. Half a mile later, soaked and muddy, we made it to the finish as they were packing up.

### Post-race
The race director was very apologetic but too embarrassed to chat much. I was too cold and wet to hang around. Put some flip-flops on, hopped in my car, and picked up a burger on the way home. My shoes are still a bit damp. But hey, I ran an 8-mile 8k! I guess that's something not a lot of people can say.

I think I just have two topics I was needing advice on:
1) did you feel you needed a larger shoe the next day? I am definitely going to wear different shoes both days as I’m guessing the foam on one shoe will get pretty beat up on day one. But in ultra races they usually change out for a larger size half way through. Did you feel you needed increased room rather it be from swelling or black toenails?
2) any advice for those 12 or so hours in between? I think I might just live in recovery sandals during that time, maybe some compression socks?

AdvancedRunning,odinsson_88,Hamstring Rehab,"Hello wonderful community. This sub is a wealth of information and I am sad I just discovered it recently. 

Background - been running for about 10 years off and on with injuries but mostly consistent. Didn’t take it seriously until about 4 years ago. Done 18 in the 5K and 1:25 half. 

Issue - tore my right hamstring in October 2018 and strained the left as well. I feel like I have done everything. Got them both diagnosed immediately after. Was in months of PT (did all the exercises), even did PRP in both sometime early in 2019. I was able to eventually start running relatively pain free in 2020 and ran easy pace all year and even into early this year (3-4 runs a week - peaking at about 11-12 miles).  So, I felt like I was ready to go back to structured workouts, but my hamstring just flare up each time. 

Ask - has anyone gone through acute hamstring issues? It’s mind blowing to me that I still have discomfort almost three years later. I see a PT still (two actually for diverse opinions) and the answer is the same. Strengthening/change of mechanics etc. maybe I am realizing that I may not be able to add speed/workouts again and that makes me sad. 

Any insights on how to manage expectations or just hamstring issues would be appreciated.",1624891772
AdvancedRunning,Nation_Of_Moose,Supporting Professional Running Is Hard,"*This was inspired by a couple of articles and podcasts recently discussing various aspects of this issue as it pertains to pro running.*

I’m a fan of the mighty Reading FC, giants of the EFL Championship. I can shop on their online store to my heart's content, buying all kinds of merchandise - from all the official kits head to toe, to lamps and towels. I also follow professional road cycling, where I can buy three different version of the EF Nippo kit, from the skinsuit the team wears in time trials to a cheaper (still £80 for the top) top and bib shorts, as well as training kits if I don’t want to be wearing bright pink. Add in various accessories made by the team and their kit sponsor. Many teams also make the relevant national and region championship kits each season, as well as world champions kit (I’ll come back to this later).

But what about running? If you’re a fan of Bowerman Track Club or Tinman Elite (or whatever it’s now called when you read this) you’re in luck - [Bowerman especially](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/577ea8e5b3db2b9290ce0406/1622659294703-XFC5W095PD8KBK4NWKVK/Cortney+White-06624.jpg?format=750w) has a great range of merchandise on sale. Fan of another running group or team? Sorry. whilst a few of the top teams offer some level of merchandise, the vast majority do not.

Why does this really matter? Part of the beauty of running is that you don’t need many pieces of equipment, a team, a set pitch, a referee. You can just go and do it in almost all conditions. Running doesn’t require you to spend £100s on equipment just to get going (I won’t tell anyone about that pair of Vaporflys you have sat nearby). That is indeed true, but right now you’re on /r/AdvancedRunning, so clearly you care more about the sport, in addition to the personal fitness and wellbeing component. 

In addition to wanting to rep your favourite team or runners gear when you go for a run - in the same way you don the colours of your favourite football team on match day - there’s also a empathetic reason to care about how athletes earn a living wage. Athletics isn’t a sport that offers a life changing pay-day. There are no guaranteed contracts, no pension funds, in many cases there is very little money outside of prize money at races. Searching for runner gofundme’s and I can find athletes that have won medals for Team GB and Australia at events like the Commonwealth games looking for money to help with their training. This is for things like altitude camps, time away from their full time job, those additional bits of equipment that a member of BTC can access by going into one of many state of the art buildings on the Nike Campus, but that the vast majority cannot even begin to think about easy access to. 

So to summarise so far:

* Very few running groups or brands make professional kit or merchandise available to fans, which is something other sports have done well for decades now

* Many many elite runners barely scrape a living

What can be done then? What was the point of all these words? *(what I talk about below is blue-sky thinking, I’m not actually expecting anything, I’m just some guy on a rest day wanting to write about running)*

Professional runners, individuals or established training groups, should offer running fans more ways to support their running. Whether that be through the brands that sponsor the team directly, or enterprising team members producing merchandise independently. 

We’re starting to see more efforts to produce video and social content above and beyond what we witness at established races, so teams and individuals are clearly looking to grow their fanbases. This is great, but give us ways to actually financially support those runners. The Athlete Special and Allie Ostrander do a fantastic job of showing their lives with Brooks Beasts, but Brooks Beasts have no (easily locatable) merchandise. Give us fans an outlet to show our support with our wallets for individual runners and teams. 

We need more than the generic Nike Elite singlet, or a Team GB adidas vest every 4 years for the Olympics. One of my favourite runners is Jack Rayner, who runs for the Melbourne Track Club, probably the best distance running team in Australia. The team does not have its own kit, the few members sponsored by Nike wear the generic [Nike Elite kit](https://images.ctfassets.net/xqkpzhsplpg2/6wrggQzDfFi3znPEcZznQ/34d53124b958db5a0b2fb6ba43eacd4c/TMP_2033.jpg?w=1980&amp;fm=webp&amp;q=90), others wear plain kit. (The 5 athletes in that image are part of MTC) Given the team has the majority of the top Australian distance running talent, merchandise would surely be bought by the fans of the team and the individuals themselves, given the huge range of fans the members cultivate - from Stewart McSweyn taking on the Ingebrigtsons at the 1500m, to Sinead Diver, who works and is a mum whilst representing Australia in the marathon at 44 years old. The team is ever-present in the Australian running scene, so give fans a way to support those runners, not just the top few but the up-and-coming members of the team too.

Whilst I don’t expect giants like Nike to start making 20 different unique team kits, I think it would be fair to at least be able to make different colourways of that year’s singlet (Nike seem to be starting to do this to a degree) and a team logo. MTC might not be able to have custom kits in the same way BTC get from Nike, but a kit in Australian yellow and green with an MTC logo would surely be an improvement for the members of the team to race in, and something that fans would be more inclined to wear themselves.

Once teams and individuals start making merchandise available, I’d hope that this could be used as leverage to make changes to the kit rules. This is where we run in to World Athletics issues (as any problem in Athletics does).

4.2 in the World Athletics Marketing and Advertising Regulations states:

&gt; For the avoidance of doubt manufacturers and Athlete Sponsors can only have one brand name/Logo applied once on items of Athlete Kit or other apparel (as referenced in Clause 5.5) and personal belongings or accessories (as referenced in Clause 6) in accordance with these Regulations (i.e. they cannot have a name/Logo of one brand in one position on Athlete Kit, other apparel, personal belongings or accessories then a second different brand name/Logo in another position on Athlete Kit, other apparel, personal belongings or accessories or have the same name/Logo appear more than once items of Athlete Kit or other apparel, personal belongings or accessories). 

Athletes are limited to a single sponsor on their kit. Seb Coe, World Athletics president, had to be pressured to give up his 6-figure Nike ambassadorship when elected president of the then IAAF. Whilst these are not logos appearing on Seb’s suit, it seems somewhat hypocritical to preside over rules limiting the hugely limited income streams of the product (especially given athletes wear national kits at some of the biggest events) but have multiple revenue streams yourself whilst claiming to be impartial.

[Being a member of the House of Lords, Seb Coe has to declare his interets here.](https://members.parliament.uk/member/783/registeredinterests) 

(It’s also odd that energy drink sponsorship has to be approved (3.5.6) - presumably Mondo Dulantis has this approval - given the vast sums of money they pump in to other, far less popular sports. Maybe allowing this sponsorship stream would be of major benefit given the money and coverage brands like Red Bull provide their vast athlete pools.)

I’d like to see these rules changed. Purists will hate this change, and bemoan athletes becoming walking billboards - the irony being the outrage at an additional 5cm logo on an athlete’s singlet as they run by [numerous advertising banners raking in money for World Athletics](https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1178137872-640x360.jpg), the IOC and the event organisers (usually with the event taking place in a morally questionable location). One of the things that triathlon does well is [allowing athletes to cultivate their own sponsors](https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSC06209.jpg), running needs to let their stars have access to this income stream too.

My final blue-sky change I’d like to see comes directly from cycling. We need to celebrate World, Olympic and National champions better. In cycling disciplines administered by the UCI (equivalent to World Athletics), the World, Regional (Europe, Oceana etc) and National champions are permitted to wear special kit pertaining to that discipline - so the winner of the World Championship Time Trial will be allowed to wear the UCI World Champion jersey with the recognisable UCI stripes,[ as seen here worn by Filippo Ganna](https://www.swisscycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1300832175.jpg). Ganna can wear this only during TT events, during road races he wears his normal team kit - Julian Allaphille is the road race world champion currently. Past champions are also permitted to have a band on their sleeve with previous titles -[ Peter Sagan is currently Slovakian national champion, and as a previous world champion can wear the UCI stripes on his sleeve.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CysozLSqftnvEfkjMV4uMm-1200-80.jpg)

I’d love to see running embrace something like this. Celebration of current and previous champions adds to the prestige of the events, for fans and runners alike. If we were to implement my first and second ideas, sponsors would be more attracted to be seen on the world champions singlet or shorts, and merchandise related to the titles would surely benefit the athletes too. Allow World, Olympic and National champions to wear a special singlet or kit in their specific event, and have a mark on their singlet in the following years to denote their previous titles. [This is the traditional GB singlet](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profilepic.aspx?athleteid=2424) - it’d be great to see Eilish McColgan and Marc Scott with a special singlet like this for the next year in any 10000m races they do to indicate that they are British 10000m champions. 

Whilst I’m sure you’ll agree, disagree or have different ideas to the few I’ve discussed, fundamentally running and athletics are stuck and behind the times. I think we can all agree that in many areas, the sport of athletics has not progressed for many years in how new fans are attracted to the sport, kept interested, and able to put money in to the sport. Where I can watch an F1 race on a camera on a specific car, with the driver’s radio instead of the normal TV commentary, we’re still in a world where key parts of races are cut away from. After the F1 race is finished I can buy all kinds of merchandise from teams and drivers themselves. I also think any changes need to come from the top, middle and bottom. Fans and athletes have been shown time and time again that World Athletics care first and foremost about what makes them the most money, and usually this is not related to the actual events but on bribes and corporate sponsorships - this is where I’d love to see athletes and teams take the initiative and give us fans ways to support the athletes. Whilst gofundme’s serve a purpose I don’t feel that it’s a sustainable way for fans to support the athletes we seek entertainment and inspiration from. If athletes and teams do provide merchandise, vote with your wallets as they say. And wherever possible lobby those at the top to make changes to benefit the people we want to see performing, to allow them to do so without having to decide between barely scraping a living or giving up the sport entirely! 


What do you think? Would you buy more team kit if it was on offer? Do you also think World Athletics needs to have a serious overhaul of its structure and rules? Do you know other ways of supporting professional runners in a more direct fashion than buying shoes from Nike.com?",1624882203
AdvancedRunning,Nowitzkis,"Starting training for first marathon, questions regarding 16 week plan","Hello everyone,

I'm starting training for the Amsterdam Marathon which takes place on 17th October. First ever marathon for me.

Since last year I've been running regularly, increasing distance per run slowly, with current runs ranging anywhere between 12 to 16km 4-5 times per week. Last few weeks I've been feeling weight in legs, so to give some more recovery time I've reduced runs to 12km and only 4 per week. This helped and now every run feels fresh.

I decided to follow a marathon training plan for following 16 weeks, but the one I've chosen starts with short distance weeks rest-5-5-crosstraining-6-rest-8 schedule, which is far below my current mileage. In following 10 weeks it slowly climbs back to usual 11-13km midweek runs and long runs exceeding 25-30km.

Is it smart for me to drop distance so fast to follow training in first 5-8 weeks, or should I keep running my usual 12km until training schedule catches up and starts increasing mileage?

My goal is to have fresh legs and do more exercise outside training during the preparation weeks, so I would finish the marathon sub 4 hours (my half marathons that I ran myself were 1h.35 and 1h.39 min).

Thank you all!",1624873104

AdvancedRunning,eled34,NYC Marathon Goal Time,"Hi all,

I’ve been driving myself crazy trying to plot out a reasonable goal pace for the NYC Marathon this November.

I live in Austin, TX and am currently running 30-40 mpw in minimum 80-90 degree heat. My pace for shorter 3-5 mile runs is usually in the mid to low 8s, but can get to mid/high 7s if I push and longer runs (10-15mi+) tend to be closer to to 9:00, though I am intentionally backing off the pace a bit to avoid injury.

Im wondering if a 3:45 target is reasonable given the grueling heat I’ve been training in, not to mention some solid hills as well? 

I’m thinking I’ll settle in at 40-50mpw in the next month or two and ride that mileage out until the race in November, with weekly long runs in the 15-22 mile ballpark. 

I’m 26, 5’10 155, and I ran NYC in 4:45 in Nov 2018 and have run 3 other marathons independently since then, all at 4:30 or slower, though I’m discounting those results given the terrible hydration/conditions I put on myself. Also DNFd an Ironman in July 2019.

AdvancedRunning,Siawyn,Akron 8k - my JD experience,"Headed into 2021, I had no idea how the state of races would be this year.  I couldn't justify signing up for any major half marathon or marathons because who knows if they would be held, or go virtual, etc.  I decided this would be the perfect time to do what I never had the time for -- focus on a shorter race distance and try to build some speed, as this would speed up all my race paces in the long run.  After some consideration, it looked likely that the Akron 8k race would be held this June, and even if it didn't, time trialing an 8k isn't completely awful.

I settled on JD's 5k/10k 40-50 mile plan for this block.  I'd never done a JD plan before (I'm a Pfitz man) so I wanted to mix it up a bit and see if I would respond to a different stimulus.  It definitely looked challenging going in, but I was going to give it an honest shot.  I jumped right into Phase II as I already was running 40-50 mpw in the offseason, so I did not need the buildup.  The plan was for 13 weeks then - follow Phase II &amp; III as written, and then race the 8k at the end of week 1 for Phase IV.

Phase II in this plan has a fairly strong focus on R work. I got quite familiar with running 200's and 400's, sometimes after doing T work.  R pace was difficult at first for me, but after a few weeks I quickly got the hang of it for the most part, though 400s occasionally I found myself hanging on.  The layout was usually a pure R type workout on Tuesday, a R/T mixed workout on Friday, and then a 11-13 mile LR on Sunday.  Every other week, JD had the LR be M paced.  In retrospect, I'm not completely convinced this is an effective training stimulus for a short race.  I think he just doesn't want you to run your long runs too slow.. but if I did this again, I'd probably just run these at the fast end of my easy pace, or maybe stitch in a brief T section in the middle.   Still, I got though Phase II just fine with the 3Q schedule.  One thing I did learn after 2 weeks was R workouts I really did need the standing/walking rest inbetween, otherwise the equal distance rest meant my form quickly broke down because I wasn't getting enough time between reps.  Once I made that adjustment, I found 200s a lot snappier.

Phase III was when he pivoted to back to back workouts, set up on Wednesday/Thursday for me.  The Wednesday session was some flavor of an I/H workout, usually around 5000m worth. The Thursday workout would be a T session, somewhere between 3-5 miles.  Usually this would be 4 or 5x 1 mile with about 90 sec rest between, following the 5:1 work/rest ratio he prescribes, though he did have a few 3 mile continuous T runs in there.  I really got into the rhythm of these.  I work, however, I struggled a bit with at times. I mostly hit the paces, but the longer I reps (1200m) were difficult for me to hit 6:30/mile pace or below.  JD also continued with the every other week Sunday M pace runs, which I continued to do to follow the plan.  About 4 weeks into Phase III I started to feel the fatigue a little bit finally, and I skipped the last M run, electing to just run easy instead.  The next week I got vaccinated, and I took this week completely easy.  I felt a little lethargic and tired as well.  But the next week (week 11) I had no problems getting back to workout speeds.

I ran every single day this cycle, continuing a streak that is up to 117 days now.  I've found it pretty beneficial, even if I'm feeling tired -- being older I might feel really creaky at the start of the run but I almost always feel better at the end of a 4 mile jog.

Paces -- it was interesting to compare my paces at the start of the cycle, and after.

* R:  200/400s were originally run at 46/92.  By the end I was seeing 42/43 for the 200s.
* I:  This one I didn't see much noticable improvement.  I mostly hung around 6:30/mile pace for 800-1200m reps. 
* T:  I saw a marked improvement here. I started off around 7:05/mile for T.  By the end of the cycle I was running these in the mid 6:5X range, and even had a rep or two that dipped under 6:50.  The 3 mile continuous T was even below 7 for all 3 miles.
* M:  I also saw improvement here.  The first M session saw me at 7:32/mile.  By the last one, this was down to 7:25/mile.

Overall I was very happy with how this cycle went - my consistency was stellar and the improvement was clear to see in retrospect.  I was running T miles at paces that just 2 years ago would have been faster than my 5k PR at the time.  The M pace miles are at a pace that would see me comfortably BQ. (roughly 3:15 marathon time; my BQ time needed when I give it a go next year is 3:25)  I got better at my 200s, learning to focus on cadence/turnover.   

What went wrong?  Not much.  I skipped one week for a recovery week - but honestly, looking at this now, I think it's important to build several recovery weeks in there.  I didn't do strides as much as he wanted - I was already doing 3Q and I really needed to keep it easy on those other days for the most part.

**Akron 8K race report**

I've run this race since 2017.  It is a tough course - about 250 feet of elevation with a fair amount of it on the back half.  You can see the elevation profile here:  https://imgur.com/a/k1Jvn4u  This isn't a race you negative split.  My goal going in was to get sub 35.  My T paces indicated that getting low 34 was realistic, but that would be for a flat course, which this is not.  My other goal was to get top 3 in my age group, which I thought I might have a shot at, given prior year race results.  It just depended who showed up.

What I couldn't control is the weather.  The forecast kept inching hotter, and race morning dawned really warm, humid and breezy.  The temp failed to drop below the mid 70s all night long.  But.. everyone has to deal with it.  I was hoping for a little race day magic, and I have to admit, it was a little inspirational to actually be running a real race again for the first time in a long time.  I lined up reasonably close to the start given my expected finish time, and off we went at 7:30 am.

**Mile 1:**

This starts off downhill, then we do 2 turns and head right back uphill on a parallel street.  I actually got a little boxed in here on the downhill part and didn't run it as fast as I'd hoped.  Headed back uphill it thinned out somewhat, and I was able to split a 6:57 mile.  So far, so good.

**Mile 2:**

This is what I call the ""banking time"" mile.  We climb about 30 more feet, then make a turn toward downtown Akron, losing a lot of elevation (~100 feet) in the process.  My pace slipped a bit on the uphill section, but once we leveled off and started the downhill, I was able to pick it up pretty good as downhill running is one of my strengths. It showed as I passed a few people here.  The very last part of the downhill I was running about 5:30 pace.  Overall split the mile in 6:47.  So far, so good.

**Mile 3:**

As this mile started we made a left turn onto Main street in downtown Akron and headed south for a mile.  As I made the turn, I was greeted with a roar, as the 15-25 mph south wind was funneling through the buildings.  It wasn't continuous, but it was gusty and quite strong at times.  The mile was net flat, but the last part we were starting to make a gradual climb out of downtown. The wind really ground me down toward the end of this section and I just wanted to get away from it and hopefully regroup.  Ended up splitting this one in 7:07.  Still overall below a 7 pace.

**Mile 4:** 

Thankfully we turned away from the wind and headed back toward the finish line... but there was a lot of up and down here.  I did fine when it was flat or downhill, but I just had nothing for the uphills any longer.  Ended up splitting 7:22 for this mile and knew that my sub 35 goal was long gone now.

**Mile 5:**

But what was worse, was this mile had the longest climb of them all, about a 75 foot climb over a half mile as we approached the stadium where we'd finish.  I dug in for this one and grinded it out, but it wasn't fast.  I knew I'd slow down, and I needed more banked time which I didn't have.  But the news wasn't completely morose.  Once I crested the climb I was able to regain pace, and as we made 2 more turns by the stadium the last quarter mile or so would be mostly downhill.  I saw a blonde woman about 100m ahead of me at this point who had passed me about a mile prior.  I made it my target to reel her in, and just opened my stride up and focused on a higher cadence, harkening back to all those 200s I did.  As I made the final turn into the stadium itself she was within catching distance, and as we made the last right turn onto the field I blew past her and on the way to the finish line.   Ended up splitting 7:19 for this mile.  But for that last part I ran it in sub 5/mile pace.  Thanks, JD!

Final chip time was 35:54.  Last time I ran this race in 2019, I had ran it in 39:32.  So needless to say, a pretty big course PR for me.

**Afterwards:**

I have to admit, I was really disappointed afterwards... but that was just the adrenaline wearing off I think.  This is a tough course, and the weather conditions were unseasonable.  In fact, the winds were crazy strong for summer, and the funneling effect through downtown was just brutal.  When I look at my HR, I was in the same range or slightly above where I was at during my T workouts, so the effort was at the appropriate level.  Finally, when I woke up this morning I was definitely more sore than at any time during the plan (even the back to back workouts) so I know I gave it a full effort.  I gave it my all, and honestly at the end that's all you can do - sometimes the weather will conspire against you.

When I use the temp/dewpoint conversion chart at http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html it suggests that my time was adjusted by about 3%.  Take that 35:54 and it converts to 34:51.  Throw in the hilly course compared to my flat T workouts and I think I did fine.

Ultimately I didn't finish top 3 in my AG though.  I ended up 5/50 there, and 75/1390 overall.  Couple of fast 45 &amp; 46 year old men showed up, whippersnappers.

**Final thoughts:**

I enjoyed the plan, and I responded very well to it.  I think I'd use it again.  In the big picture, it is clear as day that I improved throughout the plan, and summer races and hilly courses are always going to mess with projected goal times.  The fact that I'm now running T miles that start with a 6 is still a little frightening to me at times.

What's next?  Going to run a 5k soon and see if I can set a PR there.  Other than that, I'll take July and August mostly easy and do another mileage build.  Then I'll settle in for another 12 week training cycle for the HM I run every year in early November.  After that, spring 2022 will see me training up for Grandma's in June for my BQ attempt.",1624812719

This is a lifetime goal so no time limit other than getting old. I have the middle pretty well set, except for a few that need improving. I think maybe I'll save the 100M for last just because it seems like a more momentous way to finish this off. Are there any distances I'm missing?

AdvancedRunning,paulgrav,How many gels do I need on my first marathon?,"How should I fuel my first marathon?

Bit of background first. I’m mainly a cyclist. I know how to fuel long rides, and I know which products work for me. With over 4 years of structured training and racing I’ve discovered that my anaerobic capacity is high. So I’m pretty confident I have a high proportion of type II muscle fibres, I’m guessing this applies to running too. This means that I’m good during short punchy rides, and less good at long and steady rides/races. This also means that I need more carbs than others do when on long rides.

I weigh 69kg and my VO2 is ~60. I think my kcal burn is ~70kcal per km. I’m guessing my glycogen stores are around 2000kcals. This would imply that I need 2940kcal to complete the marathon. Without fuelling I would have a deficit of 940kcals. Now, if I’m running at 70% of VO2 for the duration of the marathon, would that suggest that my body is fuelling itself from a ~[60:40 carb/fat ratio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000960#s2)? Let’s say I burn more carbs than expected, maybe the ratio for me is 70:30. Does this mean that, of the 2940kcals required, 2000kcals would come from glycolisis and 940kcals would come from lipolysis?

My question is, with a 940kcal deficit, how many gels (100kcals per gel) do I need to make up for that deficit? If lipolysis is as high as 40%, then I don’t need to fuel? Feels a bit risky. If it’s 30% then maybe I need 3 gels, just incase. Or just assume no lipolysis and consume 940kcals of gels (probably 10) during the course of the marathon. This feels risky from gastro point of view.

Any advice would be welcome.

P.S. I don’t intend on running with water bottles filed with carbs. That’s presents a whole other bunch of problems that I don’t have the inclination to solve.",1624704563

AdvancedRunning,1tsmillertime206,How fast could I get ready to PR at another marathon?,"I ran my first marathon in mid-May in 2:56 with hopes of running in Boston in April 2022. With speculation about Boston cutoff times being somewhat harsh, and with the knowledge that I should probably be training for something between now and Boston 2022, I was hoping to squeeze another marathon in between now and the end of the qualifying window (which ends November 12th), with a goal of sub 2:50. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been running seriously for several years now (I hit 70mpw peak during my last marathon training cycle). I took something like 2 and a half weeks completely off after my race in May and have since gotten 3 weeks of 25-30mpw on all easy running. I feel good, but am a bit worried about getting in shape in time for a race before the qualifying window closes. My main concern is building a solid base in time to get enough workouts in, since I'm somewhat injury prone if I build miles too quickly. I've looked around for BQ marathons in my area around October/early November, and while some haven't set dates yet it looks like my worst case scenario (i.e. earliest) option would be October 3rd, which leaves about 14 weeks between now and then. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, is 14 weeks enough time for me to build base and get marathon-ready? How many weeks of workouts do you think I'd need to get into 2:50 shape? 

Can anyone recommend any short training plans for a runner at my level? I was thinking about trying to modify a Daniels 2Q plan to be done in a shorter number of weeks. Bad idea? Looking forward to reading anyone's thoughts/discussion below. Thanks!",1624660641

### Training &amp; Background
I ran for the University of Nebraska and graduated in 2018. I took a couple months off training then started training for [Ironman Wisconsin 2019](https://www.strava.com/activities/2693578801). Once that was completed I self coached myself for a few months until I joined a DWRunning, local club with coaching and a good group of sub-elite runners in February 2020. Since almost all races were canceled last year, our club put together some time trials just to get some semblance of competition during 2020. After that season of racing I took a week off then dealt with a shinjury for a little bit of the winter. Once I got that corrected (turns out my cadence was too low), I started really diving into my first marathon cycle block. 

Previous to this year I had only done 3 training runs of 20+ miles and had at least a year in between each. During this cycle, I had 20+ mile long runs become normalized to me. I did 13 long runs of 20-24 miles this year, with too many of them in the single digit (or lower) temps of Chicago. The results paid off and I pushed the wall back in my mind of what a ""long"" run is. Now an 18 miler almost feels short which is crazy! On mondays I would do a medium long run of 12-14 miles to build up time on the feet. I was averaging mid 80 mile weeks during peak mileage, with the absolute top coming as a 90 mile week, with almost all of it coming from singles. The only double I would do is a 4 mile evening run after Wednesdays workout. For Wednesday workouts, it was a variety of workouts that had a lot of tempo and strength work, sometimes 3,2,2 mile tempo work, 8 mile tempos, 10mile progression, 10x1k, long fartlek work. All of which culminated in a [19 mile race simulation](https://www.strava.com/activities/5371845448) with 2 training partners from my club. This was the biggest confidence booster I had, we averaged 5:36 pace for 19 miles straight, 5:33 pace if you take out the first 3. I was excited with how good I felt on this and had high hopes for grandmas marathon. Technically my only other marathon was during the ironman triathlon where I ran a 3:12 so I knew I was set for a massive PR.

### Other races

Some other races I did last year and during the build up this year for grandmas:

### Pre-race

Going into the race the plan was to go out like we did in the race simulation. I had the same 2 people from my club plus 2 more people that went to Nebraska with me all planning to pack up. Based on the race sim, we all wanted to shoot for a sub 2:26 with a negative split. The plan was to start out in the 5:40s for the first 3 miles then work our way from high to low 5:30s for the next 13-16 miles. After that we would see how we felt then pick it up if we felt good or maintain if we didn't. Grandmas marathon had been stressing the point about their rolling start, they would have 6 lanes at the starting line where they would let runners go off every 5 seconds in groups of 6. They also said there will be no warming up and gave the vibe that basically once you get off the bus, you will be put in your lane and wait for your start. Because of this, all 5 of us planning to pack up met beforehand at the same bus so we could ride together and take the first possible bus. Unfortunately, 1 guy forgot his bib in his car and had to run back to grab it, missing our bus but luckily was able to find us not too long after we got off the bus. 

It turned out that much of what they had planned sort of went in the garbage due to the vaccine rollout happening faster than they thought. People got off the bus and were warming up around the car dealership and parking lot, bunching up at the start, etc. We got in our group and did a short warmup and dynamics. The temp was right at 60, partly sunny and would remain at 60 for most of the race. With about 15 minutes to go we started working out way up to the front, there was a separate elite start so we knew that out of the non elites, we'd be among the fastest and didn't want to start too far back especially with the 5s starting groups. A little excitement was in the air as the elite group, which was just 20m or so ahead of us, had Alan Webb (national US mile record holder) in it. We all joked that it should be our only goal to beat him in the race. We got to near the front of the starting lane (1 guy we passed got mad and told us we should start in the back, he was going for a 3hr marathon) and had about 10 minutes for the gun to go off. National anthem, jets flew overhead, and the gun went off

### Race

Miles 0-3

The whole 6 runners every 5 seconds instantly was discarded by the volunteers and runners. as soon as the gun went off, the volunteers cleared out and made no attempt to have us go every few seconds and it was essentially a mass start. Our pack went out and started hitting the miles we planned for. 5:47 5:41 5:41. By this point we were in a larger group of about 20

Miles 3-16

We settled into our 5:30s. Our next 13 miles would be 5:35, 5:36, 5:34, 5:36, 5:39, 5:38, 5:30, 5:39, 5:36, 5:34, 5:32, 5:37, 5:33. We were hitting them off like clockwork, had some light conversations with other runners, and some of the miles just seemed to melt away without any effort. We caught up to Alan Webb at around mile 13 and passed him, he had gone out too hard but it gave everyone a little boost to be passing him. I had been taking water at every aid station which was every 2 miles and had taken a Huma gel before 7 and 13. At around mile 14 our group had shrunk to about 10, us 5 were still together, plus the womens leader, plus a few others. My coach had told me not to make a break from my teammates early on, we wanted to stick together for as long as possible. But I could tell going into 15 that some guys were faltering, it was the first time in the race I was leading the pack and people were starting to come off even though I was maintaining the same pace. then we hit the mile 15 aid station and the pack exploded. In the carnage, it was just myself and my friend from Nebraksa now in front, the womens leader a couple meters behind, then everyone else strung out behind us. My friend and I decided that we both felt good and wanted to keep hitting low 5:30s for the time being.

Miles 17-29

Here is where it started to go wrong. At the end of mile 16 my left calf started threatening to cramp up. After a couple hundred meters I realized that this wasn't going to go away. I told my friend that he should just keep his pace if I fall off. The next 3 miles were 5:39, 5:43, 5:38. My calf was still threatening to cramp but I managed to almost hold onto the pace I wanted. I took another gel soon after the cramp started and started taking as much water &amp; powerade as I could to try and go into full damage control. My buddy and the womens leader slipped ahead of me as I tried to maintain pace as well as I could but I was also trying to shorten my strides as I was afraid if I took a full step my calf would completely seize up. Physically, I still felt great, like I could keep running mid 5:30s forever if only my calf just stopped cramping up so it was frustrating to force myself to slow down.

Miles 20-26.2

Around mile 20 I lost touch completely with my friend and was in pain, in no mans land. I'm not sure if it was partly race fatigue or only my calf that slowed me down, but I slowed down. The next 3 I averaged about a 5:50 mile but I was still catching people, a decent amount of folks who bonked and even some of the elites were coming back to me despite my slower pace. I still hoped that I could scrape together a sub 2:30 marathon. Then I hit Lemon drop hill. Its the hill of the race that everyone talks about. If it were in mile 3 I probably wouldn't pay much attention to it and it likely wouldn't affect my race. But starting up it at the beginning of mile 23 with a bum calf is a different story. The hill is over a half mile long and killed my pace to a point that I could never return to sub 6s. From the hill on, my last 4 miles were low 6s. I kept trying to do mental math for sub 2:30 and taking as much fluids as possible to the point where some of it came back up while I was passing someone. That painted a funny mental picture in my head, imagining myself as the other runner, you are 24 miles deep into a marathon when someone catches up to you, starts throwing up while continuing to run, then continues past you. I must've looked deranged. I shuffled through the last few miles, trying to keep some semblance of pace, then crossed the line with a 2:31:14



### Post-race
I limped around past the finish line for a bit, talking to my friends as they came in. We started to walk out of the finish area when my right calf completely seized up and I went down to the ground in pain. While down there, my left calf also seized up and you could see every single muscle and tendon in my leg. As I was lying on the ground in agony screaming profanities, a volunteer asked if I wanted to go to the med tent. She seemed to read my wincing as yes and they had to wheel to to the tent. While a med staff was stretching my calves, my right quad also started to seize up, fun! I got let loose after getting stretched out and getting electrolytes, met up with my friends, and we limped to the car to get back to our place. We spent the day and night in downtown Duluth drinking away the soreness, deduced since Webb had beaten Kipchoge in a 1500 in 2005 that our Kipchoge Number was down to 1, all in all a fun day. None of us could walk down stairs for a couple days after and it wasn't til about 5 days after that my legs started to feel less sore again. Reflecting on the race, I'm not too disappointed. I couldn't have foreseen that my calf would cramp up and I felt really great right before it did so that gives me confidence that I may have continued on my path to a negative split otherwise. Up next is some shorter distance races and a build up to the Chicago full to give this marathon thing another crack.

AdvancedRunning,stayhungry1,Tips for uneven/deformed leg?,"I broke my hip last winter, so one femoral head lines up a little differently. My ""jog"" so far is more of a rapid walk but I'm getting stronger and faster (and I'm working with docs+PT). Anyone have any experience with bouncing back from this?

I didn't have a hip replacement but I'd also be curious to hear if anyone here has had a hip replacement and still able to run often? (If I have issues, hardware removal or hip replacement may be in order.)

Naturally, my heart rate will be higher than it was when I was in shape at the same pace, but now my heart rate seems far less representative of how I feel. I have just been running easy to build a base, and most runs have been at an easy effort where I am feeling good, and my heart rate comes out to average ~170BPM, which is +20 higher than my easy runs previously. However, there have been several runs lately where I feel like absolute dogshit and struggle to move my legs, but notice after the fact that my heart rate is quite low.

I know prices are jacked up this year because of the pandemic, but it's become increasingly expensive to the point that I don't know that I want to do it again in 2022.

AdvancedRunning,Tea-reps,Any injury-prone runners here managed a Boston Qualifier while running &lt;50mpw?,"  So, I’m about to start training for what I’m hoping will be a 3h20-3h25 marathon in mid-October (I’m 27F). Going by my 5k and HM times (19m20s and 1h30m respectively), that should be pretty achievable, but all I’ve ever heard and read is that it’s mpw over multiple seasons that really matters for the marathon, which I don’t have.

For the last two years I’ve been running pretty low volume, 20-30mpw (running 3-4 days + cross training/strength work 3-4 days). I was running higher mileage (35-40) before that, but switched some of it out for cross training after developing runner’s knee. The lower base has been sufficient for me to get decent times in non-marathon races—I got both my 5K and HM times in 2019, and didn’t run over 30mpw that year. 

I would *love* to qualify for Boston, but I’m nervous I won’t make it from my current volume. I’ve already had a rocky start—I had to take 10 days off running after another flare up of runner’s knee while I was trying to bring my base back up to the 35-40 (I definitely didn’t take it slow enough, though, so that’s entirely my fault). I’ve been running pain free this week, and am about to start a 16-week plan that I’m adapting from Daniels’ 2Q model. I guess I *might* be able to make it up to 50mpw by week 11 or 12, depending on how I feel. But given I’m injury prone, I’m anticipating that 45 would be a safer peak for me in the time frame. The last time I trained for a marathon was in my final year of uni—I was running 55 at that time, but developed a stress fracture in my shin and had to pull out 2 weeks before the race. And I had a coach and team for support back then, while this time I’m on my own.

Anyone have any advice? Or also did lower mileage + cross training and still ran a strong marathon? I’m having real trouble goal-setting given my volume and race times indicate different things about my capacity.

(For reference, my long runs over the past year or so have been in the 10-13 range, and I can run them v comfortably at my goal marathon pace—7’40—often doing the last few miles at tempo—7ish—for fun. My other runs are usually some combination of a 40-60min fartlek, a 5-7 mile tempo run, and a 4-5 mile easy run. My cross training is usually elliptical and cycling, vigorous effort, plus swimming/hiking, which I consider easy/recovery.)

AdvancedRunning,BobGalaxy,"Spontaneous 5k/10k next week, goal suggestion?","I'm thinking about spontaneously joining a race near me next week. 5k and 10k are both possible (haven't decided yet).
I have little, especially no recent race experience but did some speed work during the last weeks (atm 140km/week volume).

Now I wonder what time (5k / 10k) I should aim for. Help is very mich welcome:

Interval training (most recent, yesterday) 
6,5km warmup
4x1 km at 3:18 / 3:12 / 3:12 / 3:07 with 500m recovery at 5min/km
Then 2x500m at 1:35 / 1:28 with 250m recovery at 5min/km
Cooldown

LT Run (probably a bit fast on the second 5k): 2x5k at 18:00 and 17:30 with 1k recovery in between (5min)

Progression long run 28k with an average of 4min/km over all. 

Is 16:30 for the 5k and 35:30 for the 10k a reasonable assumption if I don't do any tapering beforehand and just replace a quality workout with the race?

Finally getting around to writing this report and despite it being more than 3 days after the race my legs are still shot.  I still need the clutch the railing going up/down stairs and can’t do a squat.  Also lost a golf-ball size piece of skin from my left heel (due to rock in shoe starting around mile 4), while the upper part of that foot hurts, and ankle remains swollen.  As a result really hoping I can get back to mild jogging tomorrow.
### Training
The last time I raced was in March 2020 so was pretty amped to get this marathon on my calendar.  Going in I was finally starting to get healthy after dealing with a tibia stress fracture and various Achilles &amp; knee issues.  Completed all 18 weeks of a Pfitz program peaking at 108 mpw.  There was one week where I skipped my long run but added a couple of miles here and there so all-in I only ran 10 miles fewer than prescribed.
One thing I did notice was not being able to hit tempo paces as well as guess was banking on “race day magic” where I ended up running an avg MP better than any I’d hit during the training build.  The course definitely took that away though I wonder if it’s less likely for one to exceed his/her training threshold the further up the learning curve they get.
My goal pace was 6:06 while the last workout I did still felt pretty smooth running 6:03 pace for a 5km with no warmup during the beginning of final taper week.


### Pre-race
Had to come back here to read prior race reports to confirm things I’d done previously.  Woke up at 3am for the 5:15am gun and had a small breakfast of clif bar, banana, and one date.  Also drank half a cup of coffee and sipped water.  Took a gel 20min prior to the start and was able to hit the bathroom just before this as well.  
The day before I tried to exert myself as little as possible minus a 4mi shakeout and focused on a large, carb-heavy lunch, with lighter dinner of pasta and salad.

### Race
Before I get into my race will provide a brief outline of the course profile.  The race starts at 8.8k ft elevation in Lamoille Canyon and the 1st half is running down the canyon into Lamoille which is at 6k ft elevation.  The following was taken from one of the only reviews of the course I could find online, and in hindsight I should’ve paid more attention to it:
“- For marathoners, you pass the finish at the halfway point and head out for a 13.1 figure 8 which is very very hard. The out and back consisting of miles 18-22 contains around 6 uphills and the 6 corresponding downhills that you will be walking, unless you are an elite runner. After this tough out and back, miles 22-25 seemed slightly uphill. All the runners I know paced over 2 minutes/mile slower in the 2nd half than the 1st.
- The first 2/10ths of a mile were a uphill loop at ~9k ft. I had trouble breathing here and only felt normal again around mile 2.5. If I had it over again, I would have walked the first part.
- 3000+ feet of downhill running in the first half seems a lot, but it seemed gradual enough and didn't do too much quad damage. there were about 3 small uphills in the first half, but nothing to worry about.”

As seen by my splits I was flying down the canyon and ended up being way too reckless.  I guess the adrenaline and excitement got to me as I wanted to pace with the defending winner of this race, who also runs XC for the University of Nevada.  He said before the race he was aiming for sub-2:40, having won it the year before in 2:49.  I don’t know how things would’ve played out if I didn’t take the lead early on, but despite the massive eventual blow-up probably still feel better than if I had let him fly past and didn’t have what it took to catch up.
We matched each other stride for stride the first uphill segment though I do remember slightly heavy breathing during this while the winner seemed fine.  I actually separated from him after ~1/2 mile and kept the lead until mile 14, where he passed me looking extremely smooth.  Not only was I hurting massively by that point, but him passing with such ease really broke some of my mental resolve.
Throughout the downhill I noticed I was going too fast to even properly stop for water/electrolytes and got a nagging rock under my heel which I should’ve stopped to get out.  I also had 2 mile splits around OTQ pace which should’ve been a huge red flag.  Ended up running a HM PR of 1:16, though I’ll have to race a flat course one day to get the real translation vs a downhill course at elevation that assisted heavily but also shredded my legs.
After I was passed in the valley the goal soon became just hold on enough to PR for the full.  That was much harder than it looked, however, as I soon became discouraged by seeing 7s, then 8s, finally 9s on my watch.  I forget at what point I stopped looking at mile splits but the goal then shifted again to just finish.  I’ve suffered toward the end of runs before but this was brutal and looking back I’m actually more proud of this performance than my PR race (which was over 23min faster) by virtue of just not stopping and giving up.
There wasn’t much crowd support and the sun started beating down, but I appreciate all the volunteers who manned their aid stations and provided that extra boost of encouragement when I came by.  This also felt similar to my bonk in a prior marathon where the breathing was fine and not hurried but the legs just had no strength.
Made it to the finish line with a slightly faster pace (8min/mi) over the last straightaway but still felt and looked wobbly and was on the verge of collapse after stopping.  Though I was humbled by the course, was very grateful for the support of friends &amp; family and the learning experience!


### Post-race
After the race I downed four little cartons of chocolate milk and a bunch of other snack food.  Immediately started feeling queasy and could barely get up after sitting down on the ground.  Though the DOMS would hit me in later days, was most worried by a huge piece of skin missing from the bottom of my foot.  It hurt a lot while my sister applied disinfectant and I was most worried about this keeping me from a return to running.  It’s 4 days later and I’m still feeling really sore.  In the last few days my only cardio has been a couple of 2 mile walks and a casual 5mi bike ride.  
Still, after reading others’ race reports it seems this is “normal” following a downhill mountain race.  If I could do it over again the big takeaways are:
1.	Don’t go out so hard
2.	Get rocks out of your shoe (also wear shoes more suited to the course and not Vaporflys) 
3.	Train more specifically for the course you’re racing..and never underestimate a course

### What's next?
Another huge takeaway is that I’ll have to pull out of a mountain 100mi ultra I was looking to run this year.  It’s 1 month before the Boston Marathon, and since I’m more focused on that race, realize that everyone else is right and it’ll be near impossible to do well at both.  At first I wanted to keep both on the calendar simply to prove to myself I could, but after seeing how destroyed my body is after this experience, realize good performances at both truly are mutually exclusive.

As always, thanks for reading!

AdvancedRunning,johncheger,Training Plans,"I’ve picked my next big race as a marathon in November.  I have a few training plans that I am looking at for guidance, but I am not able to follow them exactly (usually work/family schedule).  I imagine it depends on the program, but what do you see as the critical parts that I should follow as closely as possible?

AdvancedRunning,SelfSniped,Pfitz and Heat Acclimation,"I’m ramping up mileage for a few weeks to begin the Pfitz 18/70 (modified slightly for ultra distances). I have a 12 hr race in late August that is a prep race and 100mi in November. I live in Louisiana and the reality of fall racing means southern summertime training. Since heat, dehydration and natural heart rate drift all are fighting the ability to stay within a specified heart rate, running outdoors becomes difficult. I have access to treadmills but you don’t want to enter any race down here without being prepared for a warm race day….it’s possible almost all year round. 

My question, between all the types of runs the plan calls for, which ones are the safest or most sensical to make “heat acclimation” runs? I can make them as extreme as midday/early afternoon with 90+ (feels like 105+) or I can keep them as very early morning with lows as upper 70s (feels like mid 80s). 

My gut tells me recovery runs would make the most sense but it’s hard to keep my HR below 140 as is. I typically keep those indoors for that reason. The other side of the coin is going with V02max since it’s nearly my max at 185.

I ran in 2019 with a goal of getting under 3:30. I held about a 7:45 pace for the first 20 miles pretty comfortably, but blew up completely during the hills and finished a few minutes slower than 3:30.

I'm trying for the same goal this year, doing a lot more hill work, but I'm still curious how to pace myself ahead of mile 20.

Do I pace myself at 7:55 and hope I have enough in the tank to maintain an 8:00-8:15 uphill at the end?

Or do I try to really bank a lot of time at, say, 7:30 assuming the hill's going to kill me?

AdvancedRunning,gf2020,Ran a Marathon that gave me a time with a decimal place...what eventually does it count as for the BAA?,"I ran the light at the end of tunnel marathon on the 13th and my official time has vacillated very slightly in the days afterwards from 2:59:02 to 2:59:03 and is now bizarrely, a week later, updated to be officially official -- 2:59:02.1. I have never run a marathon before that gives the decimal place in official timing.

When I submit to Boston in November, is there a spot for a decimal place on the form? I can't remember from my last sign-up. It seems like US Track &amp; Field regulations suggest they would round up unless the decimal is literally .00. But if there isn't room for a decimal, am I in the clear to call it 2:59:02?

I know this is relatively silly to focus on but just curious. And also have read many an article where people miss the cut by one precious second and that would be especially painful if the extra detail of these timers screwed me over. So two questions to all you redditers.

1. What do I call my new PR?

### Training
Long story short: I love running. 2020 was a low point for everyone and I wasn't spared. I went through so many lows in training but never lost the love. The last time I raced I ran a 5k in October 2019. You all probably know what happens next. 2020 is gonna be my year. Well things don't always go the way you plan them. I went through some tremendous loss in 2020 as did the world and I leaned on running to help me survive. I have always loved running. 3 years ago I ran Grandmas for the first time and loved every minute of it. I ran around 3700 miles in 2020 and can count maybe 2 or 3 times I didn't feel like going for a run. I maintained that mileage up to Pfitz 12/87. I moved cities and got on with a stellar training group out here. Once again - I love running for introducing me to all kinds of people. I can honestly say I was not confident in reaching my goals. I struggled through workouts which were mostly solo, in the heat of the day, and really tough. It wasn't until I ran a huge MP workout (3x5 @ MP) with my new friends that I finally gained a little self belief. 

### Pre-race
Spent Thursday catching up with friends back home in MPLS, shaking out, and dinner with family. Just relaxing. Friday AM went to a group shakeout at Mill City Running, had an awesome time there, super cool people/culture there. Snagged some rad pasta at Va Bene in Duluth on Friday. Went to the place I was staying at in Wisconsin and had some pizza. I love carb loading. Slept like really good the last few days. That was a new experience for me. Woke up and just felt solid. 

### Race
The weather was a touch warmer than I was expecting, but still cooler than the east coast has been. I think the humidity and sun surprised some people. The mass start was a complete shit show. I showed up/lined up a bit late with some other sub 3 hopefuls and we spent the first mile and a half weaving past people. Luckily we maintained our composure and didn't run too hard. Shout out to those folks, they kept me in check for the first 6 and they killed it!  

At the first water station my friend yelled at me to take water and powerade even though I didn't think I needed it. Turns out she was right, she said people looked way sweatier than we felt. It was at this point I spotted my friends from my training group out east. They were a good .25mi ahead and I made a conscious effort to reel them in. I dropped the pace slightly and took about 3 miles to catch them. 

Miles 6 - 10 were pretty uneventful. Just locked in and cruising. I knew it was too early, but I felt good and took in the scenery of the north shore. At mile 10 my sicko friend decided she would drop a quicker one and I, being too dumb to say no, went with. The next few went in the high 6:30s and despite being the instigator, every split I called out was met with some explicative. 

The start being what is was meant we mostly ran in a group of 2 and latched on to smaller groups here and there, but were generally passing people slowly in the middle parts of the race. I'm sure I saw a couple of you out there, but its hard to know!  

At mile 19 we dropped a 6:28 and we agreed after 20 it was every one for themselves. I was feeling really good at this point and started to up the effort. It was at this point I went to some dark places. Lemon drop hurt really bad, but luckily I had friends waiting for me shortly after. This, plus folks at Sir Benedicts, and then family at 24-25 were the only thing that kept me sane. 6:21, 6:17, 6:13 to close. I finally negative split a race and notched a 2:53. 

I was just focused on not dying at this point. 

### Post-race
After I was pretty sure I wasn't going to die and could hear something other than my own breathing again I heard a friends name over the PA, which was 5+ mins faster than her goal and I was ecstatic. Celebrating with 3-4 friends that came across the line shortly afterward will be something I'll never forget. I'll be chasing that high for a long time.   

Hoping/Guessing that the BQ time will not be as insane as it was this year due to a full field in 2022. For now that is the planned next big race.  


I am now dealing with some post race blues, coming down from such a high is something I struggle with. The unknown of ever experience that camaraderie and success of achieving a goal I've worked so long for as well as running with such a solid group who also smashed it is scary. How blessed I've been to find such solid people in my running life. It also made me slightly home sick! I'm sure it will pass and I'll be on to my next goal... probably 10k related. As for the marathon... who knows? Sub 2:50? I believe I have a long way to go, I'm looking forward to the grind.

Race Information

Name: TGNY 100

Date: June 19-20, 2021

Distance: \~100 miles

Location: New York, NY

Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/5505142903](https://www.strava.com/activities/5505142903)

Time/goals: wait and see

The story of this race started 2 years ago. Amy (one of my very closest friends who I have put more than a thousand miles underfoot with) and Larry (a local training partner who is a total long distance badass) did this race together. Amy has lived in Brooklyn and was raised in Westchester so had a lot of familiarity with the course. She and Larry have so much fun doing this race and on some of our training runs they tell me about it. It sounds fun and something I’d like to do one day. 

2020 rolls around, I’m not even following this race – but it understandably gets cancelled, there are a lot of deferrals, but come late 2020 there are some 33 spots left and they decide to do a lotto for those spots for 21. Amy had already deferred a 2020 spot so she’s in and I realize this might be our only chance to ever do this race together, something I knew was important to me. So I sign up for the Lotto and in late December I found out I got in. I’m elated but also terrified, as the furthest I’ve ever done up to this point is a little over 100k, about 63 and change. 

The race is 100 miles all over NYC. I’ve been to NYC, like most tourists I’ve only spent time in Manhattan with occasional blips in Brooklyn. So I’m excited to see the city in a way I’d never do otherwise. 

Training:

As far as training I am already a decently high mileage baseline runner,  but instead of usual 65-70 mpw I worked in some 90 mile weeks. This was done mostly by making sure I got in a decently long run 20-30 on a Saturday followed by a 10-20 the next day. 

My biggest concern about this race was the heat. Of course I respect the distance, but for me respecting the distance came in the form of making sure I didn’t overheat because even at a shorter distance that would’ve been a nail in a coffin for me. As we look at the forecast it’s going to be the hottest day or nearly hottest day in NY yet this year – great. 

Pre-race:

I get to NYC and get to the hotel and Amy has already checked in and is there to greet me with a hug – it’s the best because this is only the second time I’ve seen her since she moved away to California. I miss her and I miss running with her, but we are about to do a lot of that! We grab some food because  I’m starving after the bus ride, buy some bodyglide and visit the M&amp;M store (I was told it’s the Mporium, get it?? Get it????) and get too many M&amp;Ms. We meet u/hollanding who is planning to meet us at mile 41 aid station with popsicles and she hangs out with us and we make a few jokes about getting a pork burrito for dinner. We eventually decide on a little pub, I have mushroom ravioli and it’s the first time I’ve eaten inside at a restaurant since march 1 2020. 

We meet Denise and Rachel her pacer and they are just lovely, we chat for a while and eventually part way to go back to the hotel grab some caffeine for the morning and get off our feet.

Race morning: 

Wake up 4 am June 19 

Amy has a few M&amp;Ms and I have forgotten my protein bar so I eat a honey stinger waffle – oops. But #1 most important thing happens in the bathroom so I’m happy about that. I put lube everywhere I can think of (spoiler it’s not enough and I didn’t think of everywhere) and get dressed. I’m scared and excited. We walk the 2 very short blocks to the race start. Everyone knows Amy and Amy knows everyone. It’s so reassuring to know I’m with someone who is such a pro at this. I’m in good hands.  There are going to be wave starts, the RD expects us to be kinda fast so we are in one of the latest waves. At first we were sad about it but it ends up being great.

5:22 And we’re off! We head north out of Times Sq through Columbus circle and up the west side of central park. It’s so early there’s hardly anyone in central park, the really fast people in the wave behind us quickly pass us, but then we also catch up and pass some people readily. So the wave start actually meant we got to kinda run with everyone a little bit, its really nice actually.  As we head out of the northwest corner of central park we are now further  north than I have ever been in Manhattan. We hit our first hill and it’s time to walk, there is a long way left to go in this race and Amy lets me know wasting our energy on steep hills is not the way to go. We breeze past 5 mile aid station (they are roughly every 5 miles and henceforth I’ll refer to them as aid(milemarker)) and continue one, these first sections have a lot of trail. We learn they added more trail in the first marathon where they did an out and back to orchard beach last time, So we got the benefit of more shade but also more time romping in the poison ivy and up and down. You wouldn’t think that so close to the city there are all these very real trails but they are there! We run most of these trails with Tiger, she’s totally lovely, going to be at Boston! Must’ve done some beastly training runs for this. Somewhere up ahead we see Ray K and we get a selfie with him and continue on. I found out later my friend’s parents were going to come out and watch me but ended up getting Ray a burger and a drink and crewing him xD. A little further on in another trail section we catch up to Michael Ortiz, we catch up for a while, it’s his first hundred in a long while, he used to do one every weekend, sounds like that time off has been kind to him and he’s really thankful to be doing this race. We stick together for a while before heading off on our own.

We finally come out of the trail sections, maybe mile 22 (forgive if these markers aren’t totally correct some of it’s a blur) and now the blessing of shade had disappeared. It’s HOT we see our first open bodega and pop in and grab a monster each. It’s extremely refreshing. None of the aid stations up until this point had had any ice so having something really cold was \*chefskiss\* . Amy downs her monster in no time, I take a few sips and carry mine while we jog some more. We are running down a lot of pavement industrial sections for a while, we end up passing something called the fish parade?? And they all cheer for us and the few other runners we are with. We have some great conversations with these runners, its another guy’s first hundred and we are happy to have company during this very urban section, it helps us have some better awareness for not getting lost (which we had already done a little bit of at this point). 

We get through this greenway section that just has an amazing view of the city across the water, it’s mindblowing that we have come that far away already and that in many many many hours we are going to get back there. Amy’s telling me about all the good and bad decisions. We end up running with and leapfrogging a bit with a nice couple from Raleigh, we get into the first aid station that has ice and I get it in my hat, my bandana, and in my sun sleeves. As the guy is putting the ice in my sleeves I tell him I am suddenly VERY attracted to him. We Laugh, I see they have PBJ and I get half a sandwich and we press on just down the street for Amy to stop in and buy a popsicle. And I take a break in the shade. 

\*break break\* 

So I put a lot of effort into allowing my friends and family to track me during this race, My husband gave me his old 935 since it has a much better battery than my old watch, I brought an extra battery so I could connect to Garmin’s livetrack feature, and I was tracking distance using /u/ak11235813213455 old stryd, so far all of these had been working perfectly, so probably 35 people had been watching us progress through the streets of NY and I had been getting encouraging messages from people. So I had 3 friends doing races at Grandmas and AK and Russ also had races and I’m eager to check in on them.

\*back to race\*

So this was my first check in other than sending a memey photo of us with Monster. This check in is great, it’s HOT but I’m all iced up from the aid station and I’m checking all these lovely messages and trying to get race progress but seems grandmas isn’t over yet so I just keep plodding along. Amy comes back with her popsicle and we are full of vigor and move forward. The next 10 miles are probably some of the hardest 30-41 were really rough. After leaving the 50k aid full up on ice it was great, but it was melting quick and 35 aid in Astoria had no ice and popsicles were melted so that put a huge damper in our oomph. Specifically the 2.5 miles on Astoria Blvd were just brutal and this spot probably sucked the most energy out of us. Amy was having a rough time between miles 37 and 41 but one of her super powers is being a problem solver. I was grateful for a little bit of slowdown since it was just scorching. /u/hollanding lets us know a few people have come through aid and she’s there with ICE – we are mega excited and that helps us power through even though both of us are roasting. 

Mile 41 aid is a godsend. /u/hollanding is there and the first person I see and I’m so happy to see her. She has so much energy and I’m dying lol. There is shade and there is ample ice and all kinda of drink options. I get some unspecified red juice that gives me life and a rice ball, but more importantly ICE. Ice Ice Ice. I am starting to understand why people love aid stations so much. Amy has a gallon of juice and after spending a little too long we amble out of aid 41 and /u/hollanding accompanies us to Flushing and tells updates me on /u u/ak11235813213455  race ( I wont spoil it but there was some crazy shit). She parts ways with us and we thank her for her mile and a half of energy and we continue on. At this point both of us would really REALLY like a bathroom and we stopped a couple places to ask but were denied, we pass Leavitts park in Flushing and the gate is unlocked and there’s a few people setting up, we ask them if we can use the bathroom and they say yes and we are so grateful. 

So at this point we are iced up from aid 41 and have just gone to the bathroom, we have some renewed vigor again, had a change to wash face off in the bathroom and feel like new women. We continue on.  We go past memorial field of flushing in a few more miles and play in a water fountain to cool off. For the next little while we are passing lots of house with cute tidy yards with impeccable landscaping and I’m mostly pointing and going “ ooh look at the cute one” and  “ that wrought iron is a little ornate for my tastes” and “ that’s not a regulation corner fence I bet that was a pain in the ass”. 

We come up on milestone of 50 miles and celebrate, I decide it's time to check my batteries on watch and phone to make sure everyone can keep tracking us. I plug in my watch to the battery  and it immediately quits the activity. I am livid. Amy is still pulling me along but I’m having a hard time because my phone is so covered in water from the ice on me melting, nothing is dry so I cant get the livetrack to restart, and of course now I don’t have any of my data from the first 50 miles so I cant see our average pace or distance anymore and I’m angry that now I’m gonna have to stitch files and my data is gonna be all messed up and mostly just the weeks of testing all this stuff working together was basically for nothing and I won't have a complete file. Amy suggests I restart my phone and that eventually get the livetrack back up, but my new activity is now starting back from 0 and that hurts to look at after being at this for nearly 12 hrs. But we get to Aid 50, they have ICE and THIN MINTS, I don’t sit down or anything but I don’t exactly hustle either. 

I have really fond memories of this section. We are on a really wide paved trail next to a parkway along a lake or inlet of some kind. The clouds have just started rolling in and as we look at the sky it doesn’t look like we are going to be getting any more direct sunlight. Amy announces that the worst of it has passed and we are both profoundly grateful. At this point we are trying to calculate where we could finish. We’d have to be pretty aggressive for 24 (especially with our slight navigational errors) so we are thinking about what 25-26 hr and possibly 27 hr means for how much sleep we might get the next day before we have to get out of the city. Conversation ensues. 

Amy tells me one of the best things we could do would be to get more efficient at aid stations, dropping a 22 minute mile in there because you faff around at said is really easy to tack on loads of time. Wish I had gotten better at that before mile 50 but every aid station after I ask how I did and it was always better. 

We are thankful for clouds and ice and passing 50m and we start picking points out ahead of us that we can jog to. This is a strategy that is working and we continue to employ it. 

We continue on for many more miles. One of the things about this race is that you are often looking for tiny yellow arrows to point you on the path. Sometimes they are not where you expect them and you just have to trust your gut that you are going the right way and if you don’t see an arrow for a while you start to second guess. Sometimes you are right, sometimes you are wrong. 

One of the neighborhoods we go through here has front lawns that are all exclusively vegetable gardens, it was very cool, near Queens Botanic Gardens. Eventually we come to flushing meadows, what a sight. Even when we were leaving Times sq at 5 am there was hardly anyone around, but flushing meadows at 6 ish pm on a Saturday was HOPPING. I’m not sure if there was a festival or if it’s like this every weekend, but there were all these stalls and tents to buy food, people playing soccer, ice cream stands (yes we partook, one entering the park and one exiting 😊 ) a spectator telling us we are doing a great job and we are with a couple other racers. We go past a very strange lookin thing called the Unisphere, past some ponds and over a pedestrian bridge and we are gone, the brief mile full of life and city dwellers and birthday parties and drool-inducing bbq smells is over. We are making forward progress. I lost a sun sleeve in the park when I was shuffling stuff around, my only casualty thankfully and past the time when I would need ice in the sleeves. 

100k Sneaks up on us. I had heard there would be “ real food” at 100k so I'm disappointed when we got there and they just had standard Aid Fare. Amy had warned me that 100k would be the easiest place to linger so not to get too comfy so we ask for our drop bags, ditch my sun sleeves, hat, and visor and it feels great. I change shirts and realize the chafing on my back is pretty bad. I’m starting to wonder if my pack is too small? I bought it and took it with me on 30mi training runs, but at this point It’s starting to sting to a point where I’m wishing I could ditch it but I know that’s a bad idea. So we start to leave Aid 100k (62m) and as we leave there are some ladies (they must be crewing a different runner) and they have a box of like 2 dozen white castle. I could’ve kissed them. I grab 2 mini burgs and munch them down and I am sooo happy. I’m also realizing that my pack feels WAY BETTER when I’m running with it unclipped. This is a game changer for the rest of the run. I’m way more comfortable. This is the point at which I realize I never want to run something this long where I have to run with a pack ever again. Fixed timed or shorter looped courses in my future. 

This is where I have to brag on Amy. I’m likely to stop a jog at this point and have a bit of a mosey before I recall I need to walk with purpose. Amy walks with purpose the moment the jog is done and that’s one reason she excels at this. She constantly amazes me and I’m at a point where I keep apologizing for slowing us down. She chides me for apologizing but keeps the pressure on me because she has faith that I can do it. I apologize if I’ve said anything untoward but she’s a great friend and understands I’m just in pain, as is she. I briefly talk about how quitting sounds nice. My butt is chafing and stings and I don’t like it one bit its starting to rain on us and I’m starting to just feel down about being so low energy. We had talked about stopping to get some caffeine but there just weren’t many options on the course where we were, we promise we will stop at a bodega once we pass one on the course… unfortunately there aren’t any for a while (more to come on that later). Amy stops at Dunkin and get a 32 oz coffee coolatta at mile 64. I keel over, just standing feels so good I don’t even care that I'm being rained on. I text my husband and the group chat and tell them how I feel awful and they all encourage me and it’s lovely &lt;3. It’s weird because at the end of my last 100k I still had so much energy, but I guess a track surface is much nicer to the feet and weather conditions were very different.

Anywho, we press on and get to aid 65 in the dark. Amy knows this Aid Station head, John. They are very nice and encouraging. They have an aid station doggo who is curled up like a shrimp in a chair and is very cute. I ask if they have lube for my poor booty and they DO! I ask for wet wipes so we can get out of sight because nobody needs to see this and they oblige and we are off basically heading out onto a very dark pathway next to a road and lots of people fishing on the other side of the fence we are running on. I have never been so thankful for anti-chafe cream. It was incredible. Sweet relief. I’ll just say from now on at every aid station I ask for more cream and that problem mostly goes away. 1 pt to me for problem solving. 

One of the most memorable moments of the whole race was this crab the size of a hand skitters out in front of us at mile 68. Just doing crabby things going back and forth. I say “CRAB” and Amy sees the crab and it scares her a little. I don’t think either of us were expecting that at that moment. It was very funny. We joke about crabs the rest of the run. 

I’m feeling pretty low. I don’t feel like I can keep up with Amy, we aren’t even at mi 70 yet and I just feel so crappy. I really want to check in on my phone and message my husband because it’s getting late. We take a break from walkjog to just call him so I can get a pick me up. He told me about his day and it was taking my mind off my pain even though I was surely going much slower while talking on the phone. Amy is telling him I’m doing amazing and I am so profoundly thankful she’s there with me. We only talked for 4 minutes but it felt nice to hear his voice and then we continued on. We find a magical port-a-potty. It is clean, had the capacity to flush with your foot, and a sink you turned on with your foot, and two brand new rolls of TP. The things you are thankful for. Was nice to have a break and now we come up on aid 71. 

Aid 71 was a magical place. Archie the support corgi was at Aid 71. I squealed, I petted, I took a photo, I lubed, we left and continued on to the rockaway boardwalk. Though I was not moving particularly fast, this was one of my favorite parts. It was so peaceful along the water. This felt like I place that should be FULL of people, but it was 10 (or later I dunno) PM and there was no one here. It felt like such a long boardwalk with nothing but the waves crashing to our left and some twinkling lights from apartments to our right. We are catching up to a guy, we come to learn his name is Matt. He’s cool. He's from the area and he got to sleep in his own bed last night, very cool. We get through some real dark spots and Aid 75 (there was chicken broth and HOT DOGS mmm). Amy gets us on the one block on one block off run/walk strategy and it gets us through this very fancy neighborhood as we head towards Coney Island Boardwalk. Notice at this point I still haven’t gotten that Bodega monster I was hoping for. There’s something awful about knowing you still have a whole marathon left before you finish. It just feels unbelievable that your sore and aching feet could possibly make it through 6 more hours of this. Amy suggests some mindfulness exercises, I try them and honestly they help but also I feel like I cant focus on moving forward so I get slower.  Matt sticks with us until mile 81 where he picks up a pacer and they rush off with great speed, we are impressed he had so much left in the tank, go Matt!

Coney island boardwalk is rough, I really have to pee, nothing is open. I was hoping we’d get here early enough that stuff was still open but it’s a loooong time on the boardwalk before we get off. (Also get slightly off course here whoops). But as we leave we come down a street, I remember the street names of Neptune and Mermaid there was a gas station.  So something I have learned about NYC is that all the gas station owners lie and say their bathrooms are out-of-order because they don’t want people using them. I plead with the guy to let me use the bathroom he says no and doesn’t like the insinuation that they aren’t being truthful, I buy the monster and move on. Amy drinks half and I put the rest in my soft flask. 10 min later I can’t take it anymore and pee in some bushes. That plus the monster and somewhere at 85 miles I am a new woman. I had a couple bites of cold pizza at aid 85 and as we continue on Amy tells me how energetic I am. We are super fast (relatively) for the next 5 miles and end up passing 2-4 racers (can’t remember exactly where everyone was) there was a longish 4 miles section where you go under the Verrazano bridge though it was long you could see the statue of liberty off in the distance. Amy tells me that’s where the NYCM starts, and I’ll be back there in November for the marathon. It better be cool by then or I will revolt. 

We get to Aid 90, we are in and out fast, grab a popsicle for a road (did I mention it was hot?) eat them pretty quickly and get back to employing the one block on one block off strategy. This section feels different. The blocks are short so there’s a lot of walking but a lot of running too. People aren’t exactly “up” yet, but there is activity around. Amy reminds me that there is only one more Aid station (HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??) and I am in disbelief. She used to live in Brooklyn and tells me about things on the streets she’s familiar with and where she used to live. We have perfected a strategy of counting to 20 while running. We are VERY good at counting to 20. I’m starting to get excited but my body is not keeping up with my brain’s excitement. Also I have to pee again oops. 

We get to Aid 95, we can see Brooklyn Bridge in the distance. They cheer us into the Aid station and I ask if they have a bathroom and they all encourage me to go into the bushes. I do it and feel so much better. Guys there's only 5 miles left. Amy dances to their aid station music, we don’t really need much. Reminding ourselves 5 miles chump change on a normal day. We get down to the Brooklyn Bridge entrance and there are TWO FLIGHTS of STAIRS. Rude. But really it was fine. We get onto the bridge and it’s just gorgeous. It’s sunrise and we are finally right here at the edge of Manhattan. We know we just have to get to times sq. We could walk it in completely and still be in under 26 now. When we get off the Bridge and head north towards Times Sq. I start to get emotional. Thanking Amy for everything she’s done for me, for being such a friend to spend all this time doing something so hard. I nearly cry, but I’m focused on moving forward. 

All this time focusing on Arrows, this yellow arrow that yellow arrow. Did you see a yellow arrow? FOUND AN ARROW! I think I see an arrow over there? Oh no that’s a piece of trash. Oh actually it’s a leaf. ARROW ACQUIRED.   This commentary happened over and over and by the time we got into Manhattan you’d think we would’ve figured it out. Well guess what, we make it onto Broadway. If you know NY you know Broadway will take us all the way to the finish line at 42nd. But somehow…we got onto 5th ave and not Broadway, so we added on this extra distance AGAIN right near the end. Thankfully we figure this out and after looking at a map (boo stopping) we got back on track.  I think I have nearly given some friends a heart attack. I knew they would be up and watching and that helped power me through too.  We get to 38th, these streets are small, we can see 40th. We can smell it. We run it in. The small bunch of people at the finish line see us and are cheering from 2 blocks away we are ready and cannot wait until the sweet release of being prone. We get there.

The finish line is across the street.

The cars have a green light. 

They seem to not want to move.

We wait for them to go by for an eternity.

We cross. 

It’s over. 

POSTRACE:

RD marks us down 17/18th overall, not sure where that puts us for women but based on the photos it seems like we are maybe 5/6/7 somewhere in there. Feels cool. The RD tells us more people dropped this year than in previous years because it was just so damn hot, makes the finish line feel even sweeter. Our finish time is something like 24:52. Under 25 hrs how awesome is that?! We got joint 3/4 women!!!  HOLY COW are you KIDDING ME??

Amy tells me I was much faster than her first 100 and how proud of me she is. I love her, can you tell dear reader??. We get our buckles, remember we need our drop bags. Amy tells me to head on to the hotel and she’ll bring the bags over so I can start getting cleaned up. I get up and start hobbling towards the hotel. It’s pretty common for me to get really lightheaded after a hard effort so I’m glad the hotel is close, but whew, I barely make it. I can barely stand in this hot elevator. The sweet release of making it into the hotel room I had been dreaming about for the last 14 hours was realized. I showered, it wasn’t so bad, but I also didn’t try very hard. My feet ache. I put them up. I pass out until Amy shows up with the bags. We don’t talk a ton because we are both exhausted, but it’s a solidarity in exhaustion. We both feel the same way. Grateful to have experienced the city together, to have spent time together when we don’t see each other, and to be off our feet. After she’s done washing up we head out and grab some breakfast. I hobbled there, I had eggs benny - it was delicious. The bus ride home was spent catching up with everyone who cheered for me and finally saying hi and thank you. Three people have already told me since they want to do this race. I hope they can because it was pretty magical. 

Notes:

Thank you to my husband who always has faith that I can achieve my goals even if I don't.

Thanks to all my sweet and kind friends and family who were cheering for me your messages meant everything and your continued friendship is the best gift &lt;3.

I wrote a lot of this in post-race haze so please forgive the typos and grammar I have no intention of fixing. 

I brought a second phone that had a cracked screen so I wouldn’t rinse my primary phones battery taking photos. Alas I haven’t been able to get to them because I think all the sweat might’ve gotten the screen. 

Somehow I only seem to have gotten two tiny blisters and nothing more on each of my heels. Injinji Magic I guess. 

Lots of people gave me unsolicited shoe choice opinions. Maybe lightweight 2018 Nike FREE RNs are a bad choice but hey I made it.",1624333453
AdvancedRunning,Urpledell,Half marathon training help,"Hello I seem to be struggling hard with half marathon training. I’ve been cycling through workouts but I just can’t seem to get a gauge of how well I can race a half or how to improve. I have never raced one before. I was hoping people could give suggestions on what kinds of workouts worked for them. Also workouts that help them with racing on tired legs. I already do 3 x 2 mile a lot, sometimes I’ll do a Michigan or a lumberjack although I don’t have access to a track anymore so those are kind of out. I do Fartleks as well and tempo runs although I haven’t done a tempo in a while and I have gotten mixed information on how long the tempos should be. I currently run 70 miles per week.

AdvancedRunning,redheadnamedpeaches,How to adapt the Pfitz 10k training plan with a low starting weekly mileage,"I plan on racing a 10k in mid-September, which is just so happens to be 13 weeks away, perfect for Pfitz's 12-week 10k program. I've been running 15-20m/week, which includes playing soccer, so not strictly running. This is below the 30-42 weekly mileage recommended to start the plan. Not wanting to overdo it and get injured (I'd like to run okay, but not trying to bust out a massive PR), I plan on running the program, and simply backing off on some of the mileage, perhaps building up as it progresses. The Sept race could also be a mini-peak, with a bigger peak at Thanksgiving (would love to win a pie at a local Turkey Trot). 

My running background: I ran track in college (400m, 800m, high jump), but am more comfortable at longer distances. Never ran a proper 10k, though my PR is 37:54 from a 8 mile tempo run with bookend 1m warm up/cool down.

I was wondering if anyone here could point me towards a quality training plan for the mile, my goal being to run sub-4:30.

In highschool I ran a 4:32.56, and it has been a goal of mine ever since to knock off those last few seconds. 

Currently I'm running about 12 miles a week as I coming back from a hip strain. However I feel great and I am ready to graudually up my mileage and commit to a plan. 

A bit about me - I ran track in highschool, and was part of the triathlon team at my university. I have a history of hip injuries which has recurred a few times now, although proper care and management keeps me healthy. Historically I have a 2:40 PR in the 1000m and a 16:45 in the 5k, all in highschool.

AdvancedRunning,stephonopoliss,"Pain at top of Achilles, below calf","Hi,

Towards the end of my long run yesterday I started feeling pain in the mid to top of me right achilles that progressively got worse. Pain started at around mile 13-14 out of 18. 

My achilles now hurts to the touch and hurts on and off while walking. The pain is about 7-8 inches up from the heel. Everywhere I look for more info/ advice points towards insertional achilles pain, which I do not have. I have had many injuries in the past 2 years since I started training. My soleus was strained in the same leg 8 months ago but this is different. All of my injuries were preceded by increasing pain throughout the weeks leading up to the point where I had to stop running, but this was sudden. There was no sharp pain or pop which makes me hopeful it's not a tear. 

Has anyone dealt with something like this? 

How soon can I get back to running?

Should I stretch and foam roll?

I have a marathon planned for September, really hoping I can resume training and hit my goal for this race.

Background: 29M, 6'1, 165lbs, averaging 45-50MPW. I have been steadily increasing my milage the last few months with absolutely no problems.

### Training

A little background for context..I started running long distance at the start of covid when all the gyms closed. I played soccer through college so I had a decent cardio base but at the age of 24 (currently 26) I popped my ACL. The pandemic hit right around the time I was fully recovered from surgery. At the time all I was doing was lifting and rehab so my cardio wasn't great. I was struggling to run a 9 minute mile and couldn't string 2 miles together without stopping. By the fall of 2020 I was a much better runner so I decided to sign up for a spring/summer marathon. I managed to get a spot for the full at grandmas and off I went with training. 

I officially started training for grandmas in January. At that point I was pretty comfortable running 30 miles/week so my plan was to build up about 10-15% a week for 3 straight weeks then do a low volume week. Rinse and repeat until the taper 2 weeks prior to grandmas. I managed to build up to 65mpw at my peak and stayed injury free. 

I started my taper 2 weeks prior to grandmas and it was hell. It was 90+ degrees and humid for the entire taper period. Every run felt high effort and everything was slow. This being my first attempt at a marathon I had essentially convinced myself I somehow lost all fitness even though I never stopped running. Thankfully in the last couple days before the race the weather cooled off and I got a couple of short tempo runs in which built my confidence. Going in to the race, I had the goal of going sub 3:30 which I felt was very doable for where I was at. I had decided in the days prior that if things were feeling good I would push and try to come in at 3:20.

### Pre-race

I live in the Twin Cities so the travel is pretty easy to Duluth. Just a couple hour drive up 35 and you're there. I had the day off work Friday so I drove up early and got up to Duluth by 11am. I spent the day trying to stay relaxed. I got my bib and race packet, dropped off my gear bag and feasted on some spaghetti. I went to bed that night with tons of nerves but I kept telling myself that there was nothing I could do to improve my fitness now so may as well get some shut eye. That helped me get decent sleep. 

### Race

Miles 1-6 Splits 7:52, 7:35, 7:27, 7:33, 7:22, 7:30

Going in all the advice I received was to take the first few miles slow. I tried to take that advice but it only lasted about a mile. I get excited and got up to what I thought was a quick pace. I did a lot of my training runs around 7:45 pace so these miles felt fast but I was feeling really good so I decided to roll with it. Also, I made the decision at the first water station that I wasn't going to skip a single one and I was going to take my gels every 40 minutes rather than every hour like I originally planned. 

Miles 7-13 Splits 7:26, 7:28, 7:27, 7:11, 7:32, 7:23, 7:15

I was really in my groove through this section. Everything felt really easy. I was starting to think I was a lot more fit than I had initially thought. However, there was a long way to go so it was no time to get cocky. Around mile 13 I started to feel the first little bits of fatigue hit my legs. Specifically my hamstrings and hips. I was absolutely not prepared for all the downhill sections of the grandmas course. 

Miles 14-20 Splits 7:25, 7:31, 7:28, 7:33, 7:33, 7:23, 7:41

The splits don't really show it but things started to get a little tougher here. My main focus at this point was to just get to mile 20 and reassess how things are feeling. The rolling hills were taking their toll but I was still hitting my numbers despite the legs feeling heavier. I was confident at this point that as long as the wheels don't completely fall off I was going to post a good time. 

Miles 21-26 Splits 7:44, 7:37, 7:46, 7:40: 7:35, 7:40

So this is where I learned all about the wall that everyone is always going on about. Things really got tough at mile 21. Grandmas veterans always bring up Lemon Drop hill at mile 22. What they all fail to mention is that there as a solid mile stretch of a slight downhill leading up to lemon drop. After all the downhill sections in the previous 21 miles my hamstrings were fried so that section was especially challenging. If anything I was happy to have a little uphill to even things out. Once lemon drop was behind me I knew I was on the home stretch. I mean, its JUST 4 miles left right? that's easy. Well it didn't end up being so easy. I was absolutely redlining at this point. My heart rate data showed I was comfortable in the 180's for the last 6 miles. An absolute battle. My splits were a bit slower but not too bad. Overall I was happy with how I held up in the final miles. 

### Post-race

I was ecstatic to finish at 3:17. I really had not anticipated holding a 7:33 average the whole time. For a first timer I am really happy with the result. I became a much more confident runner through the training process but I gained so much more confidence from this race. It might sound crazy but running 3:17 this time confirmed to me that someday I can run sub 3. My new goal is to make an attempt at 2:59 next spring. In the mean time, I will be running the twin cities marathon on October 3rd so training starts in about a week. 

Cheers!",1624304799

I can build up to about 10mpw but then I get stuck there and after a few weeks my knee starts to get sore and I have to back it off.

AdvancedRunning,Reydenization,Advice on training split,"My current goals are:
- Sub 11min, 1.5 mile
- Build muscular endurance (become better and last longer during crossfit metcons) 
- become stronger with compound lifts (bench, squat, deadlifts)

- My training programs plan to be 12 weeks long. Every 12 weeks I have a fitness test that consists of push ups &amp; 1.5 mile. 

About me: 
- 23 yrs old 
- male
- 170lbs 
- My level of running would be a little bit more than the average person. Out of 10, i’d give myself 7-8/10. I understand the workouts but confused about the frequency. I want to avoid overtraining. Which is why i came here. 

The plan: 
Currently I am building my training plan and I need to work on my aerobic base. 

The plan as shown:

First 6-8 weeks: 
Day 1: easy run
Day 2: Strength + Metcon
Day 3: easy run
Day 4: Strength + Metcon
Day 5: Rest/crosstrain
Day 6: Long, easy run

\### Background

M24, I ran quite a bit back in high school and into my first year of college (non-competitively in college), but took a few years off after that due to frustrating injuries popping up, less time, etc. Maybe once a year or so I'd make an effort to try and get back into the shape I once was, but one of those things always seemed to keep me from really getting back. COVID turned out to be a good motivator for actually getting back into running shape and I had a decent summer/fall 2020 stretch of running peaking around 45 mpw. That fall I tried building up my long run for a go at a sub 3 time trial, but a very busy end of the semester and foot pain kept me from ever getting there.

Started up again this winter with some inconsistent running after graduating and moving. I had no plans of racing but my employer announced a give-away for entries to Grandma's Marathon in March which was too good to pass up. After a solid 10 day stretch without running I heard that I won an entry and now had 12 weeks left till the race. Ope. Time to get in shape.

This would be my second marathon and first one in 8 years - I ran a 3:30 back in high school. The goal would be a sub 3.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Training

I didn't really follow a structured plan, more-so went along some very broad mileage and long run goals. Admittedly this led to some strange weeks and most of my long runs being far more of my weekly mileage as they probably should have been. A typical week was something of this sort:

M: easy

Tu: tempo (3-5 miles total @ low 6:00 pace, sometimes split into 2 reps)

W: easy

Th: easy

F: easy

Sa: long

Su: rest

In reality, most weeks early on I was doing 2-3 rest days a week and trying to make up the miles elsewhere. The 12 week buildup and each week's long run were:

| Week | Mileage | Long run |

|------|------|------|

1 | 20 | 15 @ 8:04

2 | 28 | 17 @ 7:39

3 | 22 | none

4 | 41 | 20 @ 7:40

5 | 35 | 14 @ 6:58

6 | 45 | 20 @ MP (6:49)

7 | 53 | 20 @ 7:24

8 | 54 | 22 @ 7:13 (tried to do last 11@ MP)

9 | 50 | none

10 | 48 | 18 @ 7:50

11 | 42 | 14 @ 7:30, last 3 @ MP (6:46)

12 | 46 | 26.2 race

Overall, my training felt like it went really well. I ran on trails as much as I could for my easy miles until the last couple weeks when I had a couple ankle rolls and decided to stay on the pavement to avoid that happening again. My weak ankles and the benefits of low impact trail running always seem to be at odds with each other. Yes, running &gt;50% of my weekly mileage in the long run several weeks was quite stupid. Also - running 20 miles @ MP on week 6 was probably not the best idea. I will say however, it gave me a lot of confidence for being in sub 3 shape despite crashing towards the end. I did somewhat of a ""soft taper"" after my peak on week 8, just gradually backing off the mileage and keeping a weekly tempo until the final week of the race. Race week included a 7 miler with 2 @ MP on Tuesday, then just 4-5 easy Wednesday - Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Made an effort to hydrate well the day before, spaghetti for supper. Woke race morning at 4 AM and took my time with my morning coffee, bagel, and banana. Got geared up and headed down to the DECC to catch the train to the start line. Weather was nice enough I left my sweats in the car. After a nice hour or so long ride and some good conversation we arrived around 7 with \~45 minutes to go. Got through the port a john lines in another 25 minutes and made my way into the starting corral. Weather was looking great - 50s, sun for the time being and a slight breeze. Another 20 minutes and we were off.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Start - 10K:

As I was shooting for 2:59, I was tentatively leaning towards a slower first mile or two around 6:55, but I just felt too good to let the slight downhill go to waste. Came through 10K in 41:17, feeling really great.

6:42 - 6:41 - 6:42 - 6:41 - 6:36 - 6:35

10K - 13.1:

Miles 7-9 I felt pretty good just maintaining 6:40 pace. Took my first gel at mile 7. Mile 10 offered a pretty solid downhill, the biggest on the course which I felt good striding out on. Coming through the halfway mark I could only think about how great I was still feeling, and I seemed to be still speeding up. Another gel at 13. Half split was 1:26:56.

6:38 - 6:39 - 6:41 - 6:23 - 6:35 - 6:34 - 6:28

13.1 - 20:

The next few miles I seemed to be feeling even better. I was pushing the pace into the 6:20s and was down to an average pace of around 6:34. In my mind I just had to get to 23 miles and I'd definitely be able to kick it in even faster. Somewhere along the way I had convinced myself with some bad mental math that 6:39 pace was on par for 2:50 and that 6:33 pace was good for a 2:45. ""You're gonna run a freaking 2:45!"" I kept telling myself. I guess my brain was fatiguing earlier than my body. They'd both be on the same wavelength soon enough.

6:23 - 6:27 - 6:29 - 6:32 - 6:30 - 6:29 - 6:43

20 - 23.9:

Took my final gel at mile 20, right about the same time things started to come back to reality. From 20-22.5 or so there is some gradual uphill capped off with Lemon Drop Hill, really only about a 50' or so hill, but at 22 it felt like a mountain. Pace going up it dropped to 7 high, and while I could gain some back on the downhill after, I definitely no longer felt like I could rip like I was a few miles earlier. The pace slipped, and after passing people for most of the first 20 miles, I was the one being passed.

6:49 - 6:53 - 7:03 - 6:57

23.9 - Finish:

The last couple miles through town I was just trying to stay around 7:00 pace.  Sub 3 was almost for sure at this point barring disaster. However, my horrible mental math had me convinced I was still on track for sub 2:50, if I could just keep myself under 6:40 pace (my Garmin isn't set to show me time, just mile/net pace, distance, and HR). So it was a bit of a surprise coming around the corner to see the clock at 2:55, but honestly all I cared about was getting the sub 3 and being done.

7:03 - 7:02 - 6:39 pace (last .28). 2:55:10 official

\### Post-race

Took a slow walk through the finish grabbing some water and a banana. Then made my way down to Lake Superior for a nice wade into the cold water. For having just run a marathon I felt pretty good. Dinner at Grandma's with my parents who came for the weekend and a nap had me back to normal minus some sore legs.

\### Reflections

A big thing I was worried about for the race was fuel/hydration. Aside from the fact that I can't seem to drink on the run without pouring half of it down the wrong tube, I seemed to get enough water and nutrition and didn't really bonk. Gels at 7, 13, and 20 seemed to be a good fit.

I did probably push a bit too fast in the middle miles, but this was more-so a race to figure out what kind of shape I was in. Had I negative split the whole way I don't think I would've quite figured that out, so I'm alright with that for now.

I'm already looking for another race to get in and excited to try a more structured and sensible plan this time. I'm thinking possibly Pfitz 18/70 if I can maybe find a good November marathon, otherwise maybe I'll do some shorter races this year and train for a spring marathon or Grandma's again next year. I think I can get my 10K and half PRs pretty reasonably by the end of the year. Regardless, sub 3 feels really good to get out of the way and I can't wait to bring it down even more!

### Training
I meant to write my training section before the race, so that it wouldn't influence what I thought of it, but I didn't get around to it.  So know that this is with the results in mind.  I did the Pfitz 12/87 plan more or less by the book.  I blew up on some workouts, almost all of them because I aggressively ignored the weather conditions and would go run 5k PR pace in like 85 degrees.  I'm not smart.  Key workouts were 17/12 @ MP, which I nailed in 22 mph winds, and averaged 6:27 pace.  This was pretty in line with my 15k prediction for the full from my last race before covid, and I felt more fit than I did when I raced that, so it seemed like an ok enough goal.  My regular long runs and medium were all pretty stellar all in all.  Those MLRs had me feeling a bit like an aerobic beast.  The 10k tune ups proved that I didn't necessarily have a ton of wheels though.  Overall, I could tell I was pretty fit, but having just a little bit more time, and a few more really good workouts would have helped my confidence a bit.

### Pre-race
Traveled to Duluth on Thursday.  I booked a pretty early flight on Southwest, with the intention of getting to Duluth early afternoon, and taking care of everything that I needed to take care of, and just relaxing all day on Friday.  That unfortunately did not happen.  

I woke up at 3 am, to find a text from Southwest saying ""Lol your flight is cancelled good luck.""  Maybe not verbatim, but that's how I read it at 3 am.  Groggy I checked their other flights to find out that those didn't exist.  So I got to book a one way ticket day of on Delta.  It cost more than my round trip ticket did with Southwest.  

Get to the airport to get a text from Delta saying, ""Lol this flight is delayed, good luck nerd.""  Again, maybe not verbatim.  Whatever.  I'm already here I'll just chill in the airport.  Several delays later, I switch my flight to a plane that isn't broken cause I can see where this is going.  Get to Minneapolis.  No luggage.  It's still on the other plane because Big Plane is against me.  So I hangout in the luggage area for awhile, hoping that the plane in Oklahoma will actually leave and get to Minneapolis.  

At about 5:30 PM I get fed up with this and talk to the baggage person.  She said ""We'll send it on to Duluth and you can pick it up first thing tomorrow morning.""  So I leave the airport and drive to a running store to pick up enough gear to at least do my shakeout runs.  Luckily I had my race kit in my backpack so that was with me and I wasn't a total mess.  Just mostly a mess.  Finally roll into Duluth at 8:30 PM, get the worst shakeout in the history of shakeouts in and call it a night.  

Next morning I do the second worst shakeout in the history of shakeouts, and then I drive to the airport.  Luggage didn't get there.  Apparently the flight from OKC didn't land until 11 PM.  RIP those poor people who got to the airport at 5 am for that flight.  They said the luggage will be in around an hour for now.  I went to get donuts, and met the brother the original course director for Grandma's so that was neat.  Also the donuts were great.  Go back to the airport and get my luggage finally.  Then I spent about an hour in traffic trying to get my bib from the expo.  So much for a low key Friday before the race.

That evening I met up with /u/run_inxs and grabbed some pizza, which was great.  Next morning I got up, drank coffee, fretted more than I should have and then got on the bus out to the start.  Met up with /u/spacecadette126 since we were shooting for around the same time and with the rolling start we were both afraid it would get a little lonely out there.  Lined up a little too far back, but told myself it's ok the first mile is the warmup and being a hair slow will be a good thing.

### Race
Gun/F-18s go off and we're off to the races.  According to the results, I passed 951 people in the first 10k.  About 750 of them were in the first mile.  Grandma's asked that the slower people show up on later buses due to the COVID protocols affecting the start.  Passed more than person in the first mile doing the run walk thing.  Thanks guys.  Things thinned out by about mile 2 or 3 and we settled into pace pretty well.  Somewhere in here there was a lady with a sign on her back saying ""Through God all things are possible"" except maybe not that because I think that's it's always sunny in Philadelphia.  Something in that vein anyways.  Immediately after we passed her cadette brought up Alan Webb, and I was like did that sign was made you think of him right?  And I nearly lost her as she started laughing.  Genuinely surprised the mile wasn't slow because of it.  Crossed the 10k mat in right around 40 and knew that was 6:25 pace, so we were pretty close to the goal factoring the downhill start.  Felt a hair tight, but like everything was doable at this point.

Splits[6:39, 6:26, 6:22, 6:26, 6:26, 6:27]

Next section of the race was kind of a blur.  The talking died off a bit.  Every split mat there was a positive thing said like ""we're doing great"" between cadette and I.  I'm pretty sure I said we're killing it every time because I'm unoriginal.  I don't remember a ton of this section to be honest.  I remember just cruising along and it feeling like I was out for a long run.  It felt like no effort at all to hit the paces.  I remember that I crossed the half in a half PR and it didn't feel scary like it has in previous marathons.  Just said to Cadette that we would need the tiniest of negative splits, but we got this.

Splits[6:27, 6:31, 6:31, 6:26, 6:33, 6:27, 6:26]

Around 14 or so I left Cadette behind.  And by that I mean I kinda knew she was close behind me and would do the veteran move of flying by me as soon as I showed any weakness.  Knocked off a couple more solid miles, until I hit 16 or 17 and things started to get a little tight.  I knew this tightness.  Every time it's happened it's followed with a wall of cramps that go up and down the backs of my legs.  It feels a bit like a spiderweb, where the lines are tingly and a little painful, and the places the lines cross are incredibly sharp and painful.  It almost always comes on a mile or two after the tightness shows up.  I told myself hold it off until Lemondrop hill at 22.5 and then I can get the rest of the way to the finish on gumption.  There was no negotiating with cramps.  They showed up at 18 regardless of my feelings on the matter.  Still managed to hold on okayish until 20.

Splits[6:25, 6:27, 6:29, 6:30, 6:35, 6:32, 6:48]

Took my last Maurten hoping it would help.  It did not.  Instead I burp/dry heaved all the way to the finish.  Thanks magic Swedish energy gels.  Got passed by Cadette at some point around here.  Kept her in sight for awhile, but couldn't remotely hang.  Muscled my way through the cramps as well as I could, but it was _not_ fast.  My range of motion was about a foot total on each stride.  Lemondrop didn't do much to my pace, but it was already so shot that it was hard to affect.  Somewhere around 24 I think, there was a sharp right turn with a steep descent that I was completely oblivious to.  Dropped an F bomb as the searing pain from that drop made it's way up my leg.  Kept strugglebussing my way to the finish, telling myself every second I can hold onto is one more second that my qualifier is safe.  In the end it probably won't be enough for that, but it got me through to the end at least.

Total: 2:56:46

### Post-race
Walked approximately a full marathon to the drink tent and grabbed a beer with Cadette, her husband, and Run_INXS where the marathoners commiserated their positive splits, and the smart one of us was thankful to run the half.  After a shower and a lot of grimacing at obstacles like curbs, Run_INXS and I grabbed a post race lunch and beer and talked about future race plans and certain track clubs in the news right now.  

### Final Thoughts
Final thoughts about the race.  I'm a little dissapointed that my time wasn't the one that I dreamed off.  I don't think I went out too agressively.  Talking was not difficult in any way for the first 16 miles.  My heart rate was exactly where I thought it should be or even a little low.  Maybe the travel took more out of me than I thought and I should have readjusted.  Maybe the heat was just enough that I should have backed off a hair.  Maybe I need to figure something out other than gels, because I clearly don't digest them.  I am proud that I fought through the cramps to finish.  That's by far and away the longest I've dealt with them.  I am proud that I finally finished a marathon with 0 walking, because I can tell you I was pretty desperate to stop.  One day I'll nail the marathon.  Hopefully on December 5th of this year in Sacremento.

AdvancedRunning,JPizzzle15,Hamstring Cramping in Marathon Today,"Hi!

I ran the Grandma's Marathon today and I did ok - I got a 21 minute PR (3:14:37) but my goal is to get to Boston. Was running 6:30's for the first 16 miles and then cramping kicked in and had to run-walk the last 10. Crash and burn with slow splits in the 9+ territory (hamstring would start to cramp and I'd stop to stretch toes and hammy out. Not fun last 10 miles).

Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/5497062061](https://www.strava.com/activities/5497062061)

Training: 40-60 MPW the past 6 months with two days of speed workouts a week + long run on weekends. I had a great training block with my training and felt that my RP was obtainable but the leg cramping felt like I just wasn't prepared at all for today. I will also note, I have definitely been slacking on leg strength training and core work.

Wanted to gauge the community and see what you fast fast people think. I am happy to answer any other questions y'all have about my training. This training included a 1:22:10 half marathon in February that I ran and felt wonderful at the end of. 

Thanks and always appreciate the amazing advice from /AR.",1624154275
AdvancedRunning,Chonnywalker,Increasing mileage V consistency,"I’m 31 male and have been running around 35 mpw since February (5-6 core/stability training per week) and since then have run the following times:

5k - 18:56
10k - 40:14
Half marathon - 1:31 

My question is: if I stay consistent at 35mpw for say another 3 months are my times likely to continue to improve, or am I likely to have plateaued or will plateau soon at that mileage? 

For context, I ran 19:30 for the 5k in February after around 6 weeks of training (20mpw roughly) but had a fair bit of latent fitness from football (soccer) and general fitness over last 10 years. 

My goals are:
5k - 18:30
10k - sub 39

AdvancedRunning,ER24,Any modification recommendations to Hal Higdon's 'Advanced 1' to hit sub-3?,"M/26

Looking for any recommendations on how I could mod the above mentioned program to hit sub-3. This is my third spring/summer season of marathon training. Had a stress fracture 2 years ago due to poor footwear that took me out for 4 weeks, and last year's race was cancelled, so I haven't actually completed a marathon, but I have a decent amount of training + 7 or so additional years of casual/intermediate running under my belt.

So far I've completed week 1 of 'Advanced 1'. Instead of 3mi/5mi/3mi on Mon/Tue/Wed I did 4/7/4, and instead of the 10 mile long run, I'm doing 13 because I was already at 13 mile long runs this season prior to starting the program. Completed 13 last week at 1:40:00ish, which I know puts me no where near sub-3. My main focus is getting my pace down over the next 17 weeks. I completed the 5 mile tempo run in week 1 today, and was only able to maintain 2/5 miles at 6'50"". The 3 others were low 7's.

If I can't hit sub-3 this October, I'd like to try again in May 2022. I would appreciate any input/advice on getting this done. I know my times are sub-par right now, but I'm beyond determined to get this done and willing to put in the work.

AdvancedRunning,Melloncollieocr,Advice for Setting a Pace for Pfitz Training,"I'm 3 weeks into the 17 week Pfitz plan (55-70M/ week). i have not run a marathon in 5 years, and have been keeping fit/ running &gt; 1800mi/ year, but not really at an advanced pace. I am now working my way back to a 3:15 Full goal, and have 3 week under the belt from the training log. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the runs have been... let's call it, accomplished, but far from ""crushed"". I am using a matrix of pace goals + HR boundaries, and for sure if I get anywhere near the pace goal, my HR goes over for the prescribed run. 

So here is my actual question: Is this okay? To be hitting my HR too high, and getting a little tired for subsequent runs? Will my Heart catch up, or do I need to reduce my goal to something like a 3:30 race, and then pick up the training pace as I go. There is much less speed work in Pfitz, seems to focus more on LT runs, so I'm not sure how to ""get faster"". It's a chicken or egg issue, do I train at the pace I want to run or will I burn out, get injured? I'm def. tanked after a 16M run with 8M @ race pace, feel *totally* drained.

Would really appreciate some support from the community, thank you in advance.",1624053501
AdvancedRunning,HoleInTheAir,Improving 400m times with 2-3 workouts per week,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 29 year old male, 5'11 and 205 pounds. I am more of a lifter than runner, but love interval training and speed work. I have no background in track, but played football through high school, and ran a bit during college. I managed a 5:28 mile and 19:57 5K around that time, while mostly lifting and running around 10 miles per week.

Fast forward a few years, and I recently starting interval training again, because I was tired of just weights. I wanted to see if I could run a sub 60 400m today, and managed a 58.85, which was a PR and nice surprise. In the last three to four weeks, I would do two workouts; one was a 4x400 with 1:30 rest, averaging around a 5:50 pace, the other a 10 x 0.10 with 1:00 rests, averaging around 4:50 for that workout. I should mention that my times deteriorate dramatically with distance. I recently did the 800m in around 2:28, and I'd be hard pressed to crack sub 6 right now on the mile. 

I want to try and get to a 54-56 400m, and I would ideally like to dedicate two to three workouts to this per week. What do you all think of this set-up below? 

* Workout 1 - 4-6 x 200m with 3:00 rests - longer rest periods, focusing on top speed
* Workout 2 - 2-4 x 800m with 3:00 rests - more of an endurance focus
* Workout 3 - 10 x 0.10 with 1:30 rests - focusing on speed endurance

As mentioned, I also lift four days per week, so these would be on my 'off days', and perhaps one of them after a lifting session.

Any other ideas/thoughts?",1624037914

AdvancedRunning,JLH-96,6 weeks out,"Hello. First, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this question. Not trying to waste time. 

BLUF: I have been on a ship without a place to run for 4 months. I am now back on land and I have 6 weeks to maximize all aspects of cardiovascular shape for a week long physical screener. I am trying to improve my 1.5 mi, 4 mi, and 6mi. I understand that is further limited by time the body needs to adapt to physiological stressors. 

My info: 

Age: 25
Sex: M 
MPW: 30 mi w/ varying pace
Peak MPW: 50 mi
Workouts: easy runs, cruise intervals, speed intervals, long slow runs 
Goals: 8:00 1.5 mi 
Previous PR: 8:20 1.5 mi 

Questions:

(1) I have unsurprisingly learned I got way out of shape: HR, paces, comfort, strength have all decreased. What is the most effective use of my time to rebuild aerobic capacity and anaerobic ability? 

(2) how should the 6 week window affect my training and adaptability? 

(3) Would lots of low impact, zone 2 training on top of my running be beneficial? 

(4) I have 6 weeks to train. I will also be swimming, lifting, and doing other workouts, but I have 24/7 to train. What is the no BS way to proceed? What can be expected? 

(5) what are the best ways to expedite recovery?

AdvancedRunning,[deleted],Weird burnout? Or something else?,"Context: High school xc/tf runner, just finished my spring season and am currently in the off-season between summer training. 

I had a problem for most of the spring where my legs would feel weak and heavy. They would slightly ache in my lower hamstring and calf when walking around, and when I would start my runs my form would feel incredibly bouncy or my legs would feel light. This would continue for a mile until pain set in and I would feel like garbage for a few miles. After a few miles of that, my right foot would go numb and my legs would feel a lot better.

This never really impacted my race performances in track because it takes a bit of time to set in on the runs. I am 8/12 days into my off season and this has not gotten better with rest. My legs just feel like garbage when I wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

This race is popular one in my area and with my club so I decided to sign up to have a go at racing a 5K with some very good runners and to see where my fitness is currently at. I've just started a marathon training programme for October with a view to running sub-3 hours (fingers crossed all goes to plan) and I'm coming off the back of another big PB for a 10K around a month ago (37:43 - around 4 min faster than my previous PB). I've not really raced 5K since taking running more seriously around 2 years ago and my previous PB (18:21) on a solo time trial during lockdown last year. So I didn't really have any idea where I was at with both my fitness and ability.

**Gear**

I've added this in here as I made an interesting observation on the starting line with a friend of mine. We'd both turned up in our old reliable Cliftons but seemed to be only people there that weren't wearing a pair of carbon plated shoes. I've recently just invested in some carbon plated shoes myself but I didn't have chance to break them in prior to this race and so I played it safe. Perhaps there were a few more seconds I could've taken off my time if I'd gambled on using my new carbon plated shoes...

**Training**

I previously mentioned that my training has just started ramping up for a marathon in October. I've decided to go with a Jack Daniels 2Q plan with the aim to run around 80-110 km per week during this (depending on peak). It's early days for this plan so I don't credit any of the results in this race to that programme, however, I have been running around 70-80 km consistently for the past 18 months during the pandemic. Each week contained at least one (usually two) quality sessions (usually interval and/or tempo) and a long run of about 21-28 km. Personally, I think this consistency over the past 18 months is where my current success is coming from. I'm feeling stronger and more resistant to injury (which was a major hurdle earlier in my running time) and I think this has allowed me to fully kick on. Consistency is key!

**Pre-race**

This race was an evening one so I had a relatively large pasta-based lunch and a small snack at about 4 pm (banana soreen - the dream!). Additionally, the past 3 or 4 days I've been really upping my water intake to make sure I'm fully hydrated as I knew it'd be a warm one. I also did a small tempo session 2 days before to keep the legs feeling sharp and I did some super easy miles the day before the race to keep the legs ticking over.

**Race**

As pleased as I am with the result, my goodness the race was horrible! I think 5K might be my least favourite distance to race. It's just pain from start to finish and it's just about grinding it out for what feels like an eternity!

The race started on a track so it was a quick (probably too quick) first km. I checked my watch coming off the track and I was running 3:10 min/km which was clearly unsustainable. I backed off a bit but still ran the first km far too quickly (3:25 min/km). I think this pace check gave me a wobble as I slowed a bit below my ideal pace for the next 3 km. These were the hardest parts of the race. From km 2 to km 4 simply sustaining a pace close to my stretch goal target of pace of 3:35 min/km felt impossible. It was made worse as initially (2 km) I was overtaken by a few familiar faces, making me feel like I was slowing down fairly quickly. However, I ended up taking over the same faces at the back end of my 3 km which gave me a huge boost mentally. The only problem was my body (legs, core, lungs) were all screaming at me to stop before I passed out. Fortunately, the 4 km marker flew by and that gave me enough of a boost to push on towards the end. However, the final sting was the final 300 m on the track to the finish. These were the longest 300 m of my life to date. And they were made much worse by the fact I was caught in a game of cat and mouse with a club mate who just pipped me to the line! That being said, I'm pretty sure this to-ing and fro-ing between us dragged me through to a huge PB so I could only thank him!

**Post-race**

Initially I just tried to not collapse but within a couple of minutes all was well with the world again and it began to sink in that I'd managed a huge 5K PB. I'm now writing this, rehydrating, and eating ice cream as I think I'm still cooling down from the race (it was a warm one...).

**Summary**

Now the result is sinking in, I'm glad I pushed myself as much as I did and it's given me a huge confidence boost moving forward with my marathon goal of sub-3 hours. I believe this result has really shown the merits of consistent long term training. Nothing spectacular, just consistent miles with some focussed sessions here and there. Now I've got my fingers crossed for a good training cycle with no injuries!

Was able to keep a 6:50 pace (for the last 8 miles only as called for) until about 13.7 miles in to the run (so completed 5.7 of the 8 at target marathon pace) and then had to slow down to about a minute slower at 7:50 for the last two miles and change. 

I have otherwise been able to do all the runs at the target paces. 

Should I be adjusting my goal and thus my target paces at this point? 

I don't really have any prior race times to try to estimate what a good goal pace would be. I feel pretty good on the plan right now but came in with a base of between 50-60 mpw.

My concern is overreaching and being counterproductive if I don't have an outside shot at 3:00. My heart rate was higher than his recommended marathon pace heart rate of 88 of your max pretty much once I got to the 6:50 splits but it was over 80 degrees and sunny.",1623961157

AdvancedRunning,ALPHABOGDOG,24+ Hrs Nocturnal FKT Strategy,"Whenever I see and talk to people doing multi-day FKTs, I hear a lot about how the heat in the day makes it tough to run and the cold at night makes it tough to sleep (Specifically FKTs like the Muir Trail).

**Pros:**

* If unsupported, no need for a tent or warm sleeping bag as the daytime will keep you warm.
* Avoid worst heat and sun exhaustion by sleeping in shade.
* Stay warm on cold nights by running.

**Cons:**

* Few people like running through the night (especially multiple nights in a row).
* Lack of stimuli from running in night.

I'm currently training for an October marathon, just finished 10 weeks of base building (worked up to 35mpw) and 1 week into Hansons advanced plan. I did a 10K time trial by myself of 44:30 towards the end of base building and am currently basing my marathon training runs on a 3:15 target. So far hitting my paces fine (first track workout 12x400m was comfortably under 6:30 target with each interval at a 5:50-6:20 pace) but haven't started tempos yet.

**Am I going too aggressive with a 3:15 marathon time target or maybe not aggressive enough?**

I've got a decent amount of lifetime mileage (5,000+ miles logged in Strava) but haven't been doing high consistent mileage for the last 12-18 months and my PRs are all pretty old and from times where I didn't really train that seriously (19:30 5K in 2016, 3:18 marathon in 2016, 1:39 HM in 2012, 43:20 10K in 2019).",1623947620

Galen Rupp, the current 10k record holder will be racing tomorrow too, but I think this will be more of a tune up race for the Olympic marathon so he won't be giving it 100%, but I can see him leading most of the race and making it fast from the start.

AdvancedRunning,__CJ2__,Balancing returning from injury and getting back in shape,"Hi all. Just for context I’m 20M. In the winter/spring I was training for my third marathon (previous PB of 2:59) and I felt like I was in shape for a 2:50 (I negative split a 1:20 HM and felt fantastic), however I suffered a stress fracture in my foot and was unable to complete my marathon.

My question is, once you’re fully recovered from injury, what’s the best way to return to marathon shape without hurting myself again? How many weeks should I spend on building up mileage, and what should the base mileage be before I start my next training plan. And then, what should my next training plan be, and when should I start the training plan?

AdvancedRunning,Jersey8291,Running Burnout,"Hey, I’m 18 and an upcoming freshman collegiate athlete. During my spring season of track I experienced some of the worst burnout and anxiety of my life. My goal was to go sub 5 in a mile or 1600 cause a mile is 1609 which is dumb, but besides the point I eventually ended up achieving it but it had its consequences. Almost every night before each race not even a 1600 I would get almost little to no sleep and I’ve had problems with anxiety in the past but never like this even when my mind was calm and I’d taken melatonin and done everything I could aka going to sleep earlier I still would close my eyes and stay awake. I believe this was caused by my burnout I’ve been doing running for two years straight basically through covid I only increased my mileage and training. I would do things like 3000 sit-ups 80 minute planks all in the effort to be the best runner I could be. I have my college season coming up soon and idk what to do as it feels like I have almost nothing left to go and run it feels like yeah I could hang but I’d hate every minute of it. I made a huge transformation from the person I was two years ago and I believe it’s apart of this befofe this I did little no physical activity. I’m going to try swimming next week and see how I feel thanks. If anyone has any ideas or just input it’s appreciated, For reference https://imgur.com/gallery/pyhJqy4",1623939040

I’m not training to be competitive for any particular race, just aiming for some broad notion of athleticism with respectable strength, speed and endurance. So...I can train however I want and recently I’ve been working on the 5k! Over the last year I’be dropped from around 23:00 to 17:40.

My friend (experienced marathoner) reckons I’ll have a good shot at breaking 16:00 in 1.5 years, but thinks there’s no way I’ll be able to do so while holding onto the muscle mass I need to keep the 100m under 11s.

AdvancedRunning,delmar42,Patellofemoral Chondromalacia - Runner's Knee,"I've been diagnosed with Runner's Knee in both knees (yay me). I'm normally used to high mileage, hills, roads, trails, etc (I trend toward ultra marathon running). However, I've had a couple of injuries since last fall that sidelined me. I ran when I was allowed to (following doc and PT advise), and did a lot of cross-training. However, I think that I lost fitness in some key glute/hamstring/quad muscles. I was just starting to get back into mid-level mileage this past month (30-40 mpw) when one knee started hurting. I kept running through it (of course), and then the other knee started hurting two weeks later. Now I have all the classic signs of Runner's Knee (and have a formal diagnosis).

My PT and coach have me doing a lot of strengthening exercises, which I'm doing daily. I'm also going to see if Cortisone shots will help reduce the pain while I try to work on my muscle imbalances. I've ordered an under the knee wrap/brace for each leg to help out a bit.

For anyone else who has had this, do the strengthening exercises help? Have you had luck with the shots, and the wraps/braces? I do have one race coming up (Mt. Evans Ascent) which is ""fortunately"" all uphill, since downhill is murder on me at the moment. However, two weeks after that, I have a 50 mile mountain race in Leadville, CO.

**This week is the Ice Cream Sandwich**.

*History*

Who doesn't like ice cream sandwiches?! From [Lauren Fleshman's Workout of the Week series on Strava](https://blog.strava.com/wow-the-icecreamsandwich-9584/).

*What*

This workout is basically an easier variant of The Lumberjack. Apparently the magic of the workout happens in the final tempo, when your body has to clear the lactate acid built up during the 6x1' hard set. The second tempo will feel like a slow pace after the hard 1 minutes! If you find it too easy, increase the tempo time up to 12-15 minutes.

* 10-15 minute warmup
* 10 minute at tempo pace w/2-3 minutes rest
* 6x (1 minute hard, 1 minute rest) w/2-3 minutes rest at the end of the set
* 10 minute tempo
* 10-15 minute cooldown

*How*

Tempo portions at slightly faster than half marathon pace, 1' intervals at about 3000m pace.  For a variations, the tempos on either end can build up to 15 minutes each or you can even do them as a progression, increasing every 5 minutes.",1623849800
AdvancedRunning,tomatessechees,VAM: running vs. cycling," \[cross-posted on r/cycling\]

For those who run and do road cycling (and live near mountains!), I am curious about your experiences with average vertical speed (VAM). Are your numbers mostly the same or are there big differences?

I personally use this to manage efforts on cycling climbs &gt;6%, and also keep a close eye on it during long ascents trail running. I also use it as a proxy for aerobic fitness.

For example, right now, for a 20 minute duration, at the same perceived effort (near maximum) cycling I can sustain a \~1100 m/h VAM and \~1250 m/h VAM running/speed hiking. If I put in the weight numbers (65kg me + 10kg bike+bottles), this would imply that I am only 1.5% more efficient (effectively 0% given the uncertainties on the numbers) on a bicycle, which doesn't seem to make sense as I had assumed that cycling should be more biomechanically efficient than running/hiking.

At the extreme end, for 30 minutes Kilian Jornet can maintain 2000m/h running (i.e., a VK race in half an hour) and 1800 m/h ski mountaineering. Unfortunately, I don't know his numbers on a bike...but top professional cycling climbers can usually sustain about 1800 m/h on fairly long climbs.

AdvancedRunning,grayf0xy,"Piriformis syndrome, returning to running after hip scope"," Hey all,

Was wondering if  anyone has returned to running after a hip scope and what their experience was like. I tore my labrum at the end of 2019, had it  repaired October of 2020 (everything delayed due to covid)

Did  my PT and returned to running very slowly but basically everything  constantly bothered me. Body was not used to the impact and motions as  I'd basically been sedative for 18 months. 

Piriformis  is never something that's bothered me but it's been persistent for  months now. I can barely jog a couple miles without it flaring up. I  took a month off because I had my gallbladder removed (hooray for more  surgery), and the piriformis acted up immediately. 

I've  been rolling it on a ball, figure 4 stretching, trying to work through  it. I did a ton of PT post op so I am probably the most balanced I've  been , so this has all been frustrating. ",1623786226
AdvancedRunning,jebCR,Which Pfitz plan for my first Marathon?,"**Background and Target:**

* 31 Male (175cm 67kg) , training for my first ever Marathon (Amsterdam, 18 weeks from now).
* Averaging 60km/week (37 MPW) for more than a year, currently at 70km/week (43MPW). Never peaked higher than 45MPW (never tried to either).
* Training so far mostly consist of: Easy, Tempo and Long Runs (usually around HM distance) with limited speedwork/anaerobic running.
* Recent best efforts: 20km in 1:17:10, 10M in 1:00:51 (none were in perfect conditions. Both felt like longer would be ok, faster would be very difficult)
* Target: There isn't any PR to beat, but Sub3 is a must. I hope that a good training cycle could get me in the low 50s.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**

I am thinking about doing a Pfitz cycle, but can't decide which option to pick:

1. Start the 18/55 plan now, which means decreasing my mileage by 10M in week 1 (-25%)
2. Build up mileage over the next 6 weeks then start the 12/70 plan (week 1 is 55MPW (+25%))
3. Maintain base and rest a bit over the next 6 weeks to then start the 12/55 plan
4. Tune up the 55 plan by turning day offs into recovery days when it feels right

AdvancedRunning,SquizzyGirl,Need tips/guidance to hit a goal 5k PR! Feedback please :),"Hey all! Sorry, might be a long post because I added some metrics!

35/F running off and on for 17 years. 
I'm trying to beat my all-time PR of 19:35 (20 years old). Most recent 5k race time was 19:51 at 33 before COVID hit :(
Goal 1 is sub 19:30 and goal 2 is sub 19min 5k. Would like to go lower obviously, but starting with clearly attainable goals first!

Planning a 5k time trial in a couple weeks to see where I'm at. 
Recently started a focused track workout series but I don't really know what I'm doing.
Been doing repeats and sprints, recalling workouts from when I was on teams and from things I have read from running forums.

Current best times from interval workouts:
1000m = 3:32min
800m = 2:49min
400m = 81s
200 = 35s
100 = 14-15s

All my times have fallen below or between the range for projected 18:50-19:50min 5k based on pace calculators. So it seems my goals are within reach? Most of my track times cluster below the 18:50min projection, which I am hoping is promising!

What kinds of resources should I use for constructing my workouts? I feel on track, but don't have a reference point (other runners). I think my times are good? I am working very hard to hit this goal. The early summer weather has been a challenge for me - I don't do well in the heat.

Recent workouts (the descending ladder is a fav) have been like:
2x800, 4x400, 4x200, 4-6x100
3x1000 (planned 5 but the weather killed me)
5x3min with 90s rest, 3x1min sprints (forest run)
4.4km tempo run 

Would getting a professional coach be advisable?
Please let me know if you have some helpful tips on how to reach my goals or feedback on my track workouts or times :)

AdvancedRunning,not_alemur,Form correction - from a “shuffle” to a “roll”,"Not sure how else to put it, but I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. I’ve been dealing with PF for around 6 months. I went to a new running specific PT, and they focused a lot on my toe flexibility. My pinky toe had been migrating and they suggested buying a pair of toe spacers to correct it, and I’ve been wearing them consistently since (brand - Correct Toes). Additionally, they noticed I have a tendency to clench my toes, which affects my walking motion in a way where I will shuffle my feet instead of allowing my foot naturally roll off itself. Subsequently, this is believed to overload my plantar fascia, and may be contributing to my PF. I’ve been given some exercises to help address that issue, and have been able to manage the PF and keep pain levels down to around a 1-2 while continuing to train.

I do however notice that I have to be intentional about ensuring I roll my feet as opposed to shuffling them while running. It’s not hard, and it feels better, with a palpable increase in efficiency, but I still have to be intentional about it and I’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience in making a correction to their running form. It’s not to say it’s “hard” to do, necessarily, but I’m curious if this will become muscle memory and it will get easier overtime. I’d appreciate to hear about any similar experiences!",1623713801

AdvancedRunning,Stevegap,Why do we still talk about training in distance instead of time?,"Hi everyone,

This is a broad question, so stick with me. Beginner running plans are all structured around time, whereas advanced plans are all mileage based.

A 3 hour marathoner is considered to be a pretty strong runner, but they're racing at 2/3rds of the pace of an elite marathoner. Even if the training pace gap isn't the same, a 20% difference in training pace leads to them spending quite a bit more time on the road, and a lot of people running 3.5-4 hour marathons are still running 70 mile/week plans, but are spending a ton more time on the road than faster runners.

I get that there's gotta be a certain amount of fixed distance training for racing a fixed distance, but are people who take 15 hours of running to run 70 miles getting the same benefits as people running 70 miles in 9 hours?",1623619282

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Long term Achilles pain?,"In mid February I got sudden heel pain during one run. The pain was terrible (8/10). That month, I felt like I was in agony with every step. What was weird was that wearing flip flops or going barefoot did not hurt at all but wearing closed back shoes irritated my heel and it hurt a lot. I took a month off of running and walking (only biking which sort of felt ok). I went to a sports medicine doctor but they couldn’t really figure out if it was tendinitis or bursitis. 

In March, I tried on some new running shoes that came up higher in my heel and sure enough it did not hurt at all to run or walk! I was able to ease back into running and walking in normal shoes with little to no pain. Hooray! I went on to run track and had one of my best seasons. 

Anyways over the past couple of days I’ve noticed my Achilles and calf is really tight which has happened every now and then since my injury. It’s not painful like it was back in February (nowhere’s near that bad and it’s more stiffness not pain - also higher up on my leg) but it just feels stiff and heavy where my other leg does not.

I ran through foot pain last summer for a month (what I thought was plantar fasciitis). This isn’t pain though so I’m thinking I should just stretch my calf a lot.... I know this sounds weird, but I have a feeling that even if I took a month off and did nothing, my Achilles will still feel tight and exactly the same. Since the running does not seem to be hurting it, I’ve figured I should just stretch more and keep running. I honestly can’t feel anything when I’m racing or training. But is this not the thing to do? Has anyone dealt with this? XC starts in two months and I already plan to cross train a ton.

* **Name:** St. Jude Benefit Run
* **Date:** June 12th, 2021
* **Distance:** 5K
* **Location:** Yates City, Il
* **Time:** 18:50

### Goals

|------|-------------|------------|

### Splits
| Mile | Time |
|------|------|
| 1 | 5:51
| 2 | 6:05
| 3 | 6:16

### Training
I've been putting in 30-35 MPW. Workouts have been either 800M intervals or 1K intervals

### Pre-race
I was feeling stiff in the days leading up to the race and wasn't sure why. My shoes are pretty new, I've been resting well and my easy runs this past week were very easy. Thankfully I woke up this morning feeling better and was ready to go after a proper warmup

I had no real expectations for this race, other than to use it as a dress rehearsal of sorts for a four mile race next Saturday. My last race was a 3 mile run in September that I ran in 17:10, while my 5K best is 17:50. I was not expecting to PR here, but I was set on running a relatively hard effort regardless. I figured if I ran this at a 5:45 to 5:50 pace, I'd be happy. As you can see from my split times, this didn't happen, which I'll explain in a moment

### Race
I did not account for potential humidity. It was humid - it was almost 80F at seven in the morning when the race started with a relative humidity of ~90% and dew point of around 72 or 73

I started just fine, didn't go out too fast, and hit the first mile right around where I thought I would. But it was also just as I completed that first mile that the adrenaline wore off and I started realizing how difficult it was to breathe. I slowed down a bit, though this didn't help much, and from basically the halfway point onward the race turned more into a mental battle. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to stop to catch my breath - I was sweating bullets and felt like my lungs had collapsed. But I asked myself repeatedly ""How bad do you want it?"", and the answer was ""Bad enough to adjust our expectations and grind this out"". I slowed down a little more during the second mile, but it honestly didn't feel like it made much of a difference, and I gave the final quarter of a mile whatever energy I had left to finish relatively strong

It also didn't help that this course is just long, straight stretches of nothing - Yates City is a town of 750 people out in the middle of a bunch of country. There's nobody to cheer you on along the course and nothing particularly interesting to see

### Post-race
I crossed the finish line and immediately sat down with the coldest bottle of water I could find. It genuinely felt like I'd never run a 5K before. I caught my breath for a few minutes before talking with some of the race organizers and a few people who finished after me. Then I ran back onto the course to find my friend Jason (who was running with his dog) and ran with him until he finished. We talked a bit after, I drank a ton more water, then I went home

At first I was disappointed with how this went; I was expecting much better than a 6:04 pace. But when I got home, I did some reading on how humidity affects running, and apparently, given the conditions, I performed just fine. I found a ""calculator"" someone else on this subreddit made in Google Sheets that takes temperature, dew point, etc, into account and tells you what your adjusted pace should be given the humidity. Apparently I was right around where I should be, which made me feel a bit better. I also reminded myself that physically, I felt fine during the race, never felt like I was straining or cramping - even now, sitting here typing this, I don't feel particularly sore or anything. I was a lot more accepting of my time/performance once this was all put into perspective. And honestly, I'm just proud that I conquered the mental aspect of it too

I also won first place by a couple of minutes and they gave me fifty dollars, so I took my brother out to pizza for dinner

### What's Next?
Not a lot of time to relax, I'm running [Steamboat Classic](https://www.steamboatclassic.org/4-mile/) next Saturday. Really hoping it's not as humid, though the course should be better

However, two years down the line I’m now a Strength &amp; Conditioning coach and have made the first phase of a program for myself based on what I think seems right. I’m curious too see what those with more running experience at longer distance think.
Here is a picture of the month program I have right now

AdvancedRunning,Sensitive_Buy1656,Heart Rate Zone Questions,"I have some pretty basic questions about heart rate zones but I am having trouble finding good resources. 

Questions: -I've read it can be unhealthy to spend too much time up in your peak range. What are the risks? 

\-Do I need to be changing my training to spend more time in the ""cardio"" zone? (Tips for how to stay in that range given that I can't easily see my HR while running?)

\-How do I improve my fitness so that I can push my body harder while staying in lower zones? 

\--

Core Problem: -All of my runs have me in my peak heart rate zone according to my Fitbit (usually a peak of around 195) regardless of how hard I feel I'm running. Monday I did what felt like a pretty easy 1.5 miles (9:14 pace) and my HR was up at 188, Thursday I hit my 1.5 mile PR since returning to running (8:13) and my HR was up to 198. Today I did 4.4 miles, average pace 9:28, HR max 194 - it got up into my ""peak"" zone very quickly and stayed there the whole run. 

About Me: I'm a 30F, 5'6"" 143 (currently working on shedding a few extra pounds in healthy way, it's a struggle. Resting heart rate - 60-63 BPM. 

Activity: Currently doing about 10-15 miles in a week, after running my first half marathon last month. I completed the half marathon doing a walk-jog method trying to come back from an injury. I had been building up miles using that method, running almost every day, for about 5 months. Since the half marathon I have been running 1.5 miles every day, with longer runs on weekends. The length of the long runs has been very variable and time dependent. Today's 4.4 was the longest I've done without walking this year. But I often get in longer runs with the walk jog method. I have been doing a daily stretching routine and for the last 3 weeks doing a beginner strength workout for runners 3 times a week (both on Dynamic Runner). Both stretching and strengthening have made a HUGE difference for how my body feels and for my ability to push pace over the last month. I struggle quite a lot with picking up pace although I have been improving lately, it's slow progress. I feel a little incompetent that my PR was still over an 8 minute mile, after 6 months of working pretty hard on it. 

Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated! (Also - I'm sorry if this isn't the right tip of post for this sub. Should this be in /running instead?)",1623542524

|C Goal|Finish in one piece √|

Got to the track and didn't feel so hot on the warmup (HR climbed up to 170s). Was debating if I even wanted to run a mile anymore with the mix of nerves and everything else. 

First 409m (74) : Went out in 36 feeling alright. Morale was already taking a hit on the opening lap. Debated walking off after the first lap

800m 2:30 (76) : This point kinda started dilly dallying in my head thinking about random stuff not even thinking about the pace so it dropped. Had the same exact thought as the previous lap but kept on trucking

1200m 3:46 (76) : My attention mainly went to dodging the people walking in lane 1 and 2 and going around the clowns running two wide in those same lanes.

1609m 4:58 (72): Had a o shit moment when I realized when I was on the final lap. Decided to turn on the jets a little but wasn't hunched over when I finished.

Final time: 4:58.8

Post race thoughts: 

I need more motivation to push myself. Probably gave 90% of the tank today. Definitely think I'm capable of sub 4:50 but need someone to chase or to relax the nerves a little more pre race. Honestly happy to still break 5 on a off day where I wasn't present at all mentally though. My old mile PR is 4:57 and my chest was burning for 4 hours the last time I ran this distance like 6 years ago.

AdvancedRunning,SpecialFX99,Update: I tried to run my fastest mile yesterday!,"This is an update to [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/n1xvzt/how_to_run_my_fastest_mile/) which was a wealth of information for me. Thank you to everyone that responded!

I'm not going to make you read all the text if you just want to see my result so here it is: I ran 5:18 and couldn't be happier!

I didn't manage to follow any one person's advice completely but I took bits and peices from everyone, substituted a couple races for speed work, did one time trial and adjusted my warmup routine.

I was really shocked how fast I could get back to running even after pretty intense speed work. I think I had been doing my speedwork too easy and not often enough out of fear I'd take too long to recover. I saw the difference in speed pretty fast once I upped the frequency and intensity. 

I did a time trial on as similar route as possible to the race route and despite losing my focus in the middle and falling off pace a bit I managed a 5:39 when my race goal was only 5:45. I had no idea how much more I had in me so I went into the race just trying to best that time. A local coach told me he thought I was good for 5:15 and I just laughed at him.

Imagine that! The coach knew what he was talking about! I don't have much to say about the race. I did a 20 minute warmup with 5 strides, lined up at the back of the pack and ran like hell to the finish. I was surprised to find I had a really strong kick still and managed to pick 2 people off in the last 50 feet or so. No DFL like I was worried about!

The whole lead up to the race I felt like a poser for entering the elite heat but I felt a little more justified when there were 12 people behind me and my time would have been 2nd OA in the open heat. Don't get me wrong, I know I'm nowhere near being an elite runner but I think I at least belonged in the elite heat for this race.

Thanks again for everyone who responded with advice in my first post. I'll end with some advice of my own. Don't be scared to jump into the deep end. You might find out that you have been selling yourself short and are capable of a lot more than what you give yourself credit for!

[INSTAGRAM POST](https://www.instagram.com/p/CP_ahvQrtrK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Allie Ostrander has been in treatment for a month and a half for an eating disorder. This treatment is not entirely voluntary. This is why she has been in Denver for her last few videos.

I have very little to add to this. Please watch the video if you are interested; I think she does a phenomenal job explaining what she is going through right now. Unlike most athletes who share their story, she has not recovered. She is, as she says, currently ""in the shit."" She has chosen to share her journey from here on out. Again, she elaborates on her reasoning in the video.

People are constantly asking questions on this sub about nutrition, and I feel like our community is a great place to get (non-professional) advice, with a constant emphasis on your own personal growth and success over what you should specifically eat or how your body should look or weigh. But that's never enough for people who are struggling.

I thought I'd make this post in hopes that it may spark some discussion, or at the very least remind people who are ""in the shit"" that you're not alone. Allie O has been one of my favorite athletes for years now, and it's crushing to see her go through this, but she's sharing it with all of us. Let's wish her the best on her road to recovery.

After this track season ended my coach (Reuben Reina) gave me a three week break where I could only run 4-5 miles every other day. This alone was pretty disheartening because I had been on a roll when it came to running. He started me back up running daily on the first of June, but when I saw the workout plan I felt even worse. I’d only be doing 28 miles the first week, 30 miles the second week, and by the end of the month only 39 miles. While he plans for me to hit 50 miles a week by the first of august, these first few weeks feel like a waste of time and I have so much more to give. I can’t help but feel like a piece of shit.

Is he trying to prevent over training and injury? Because I had been doing much more mpw than these first few weeks even when incorporating speed workouts during the winter.

AdvancedRunning,-zinge-,Question About Lactate Threshold Test Results,"Last night I re-did the Lactate Threshold test to see how I've improved since December 2020 (currently starting taper from 50k training cycle). I'm using the 30 minute all out test outlined by Joe Freel. Using a chest strap, 42M.

I was an occasional runner prior to November 2020, so running economy was mediocre with lots of room for improvement. Here's the results for both:

December 2020:

last 20 avg HR: 191 (max 193)

last 20 avg pace:  8:12/mi  (5:05/km)

Obvious improvement, but what confuses me is that the drop in HR. Did I not push hard enough? I don't think I could have pushed harder honestly. Is in normal to decrease max HR? I thought I had read somewhere that threshold HR should increase with fitness (closer to max), finding conflicting info on the google now.

\---

**Background;**

I am running for the high school track team at my school (although I am only in 8th grade this year). I started running when I got into middle school and ran 2 seasons of XC and 1 season of track for the middle school team (seasons were cancelled due to the pandemic). Last year, I ran a PR mile of 5:59 which was pretty big for me (I know this may seem quite slow to many people, but for me at that time it was huge). But after running that time, XC got cancelled and I just kind of stopped running. I got lazy and never found times to run. 

Fast forward to around April and the track season has just been cancelled. I was really sad and disappointed and as a result I just kept my streak of not running. (*I wanted to run, its just that I never actually did it*). But, just as I was going to have a season of no running once again, I got an email from the high school coach asking if I would like to run high school track along with some of my close track friends. I jumped at the opportunity and accepted his offer, so there I was running with the high schoolers, actually having a season of running.

Practice started on a Monday and me and the 6 other 8th graders were really exited. over the next few weeks we trained hard. the workouts were extremely intense and it was really hard keeping up with the high schoolers, but it was good practice. Then, I got ""injured"". Shin Splints, and they suck. I bet all of you have had them at least once so you know what I'm talking about. This really affected my training and I had to take it easy for about two weeks. At this point I had ran about 2 meets, both had gone okay but I wasn't running great (or what I was wanting to run). The time that I was most proud of was my 800m time, which was a 2:33 (like I said, not amazing but it was sort of a goal I had for that race). I was .5 seconds away from a fellow 8th grade teammate who I let get a bit to far ahead of me in the end, a disappointment again but I was still happy.

The next few races were major setbacks and over the following 4 meets I never got any faster, in fact, I got slower. I ran the following times: 2:34, 2:40, 2:36, and then 2:34. I just wasn't improving and my teammates kept getting faster. Throughout all this the other 6 8th graders started to run really fast times (or most of them). One of my teammates ran his first mile this season and ran a 5:17! first try! he then reduced that to a 5:03! and that is his best time for the season. another one has a PR in the mile of 5:24 and a 2:24 800m PR. So as I see them getting faster and faster and me not improving at all, it really made me frustrated. I trained hard, got hurt again and kept working but I never could beat them or my own time. 

Then came the second to last meet of the season. It was a hot day with little shade anywhere. I wasn't feeling amazing for this race but I wanted to try and beat another fellow eighth grader who was a bit faster than me (at this point I was the second slowest 8th grader). I got up to the starting line and ran a nice 800m, I went out at a nice pace and ended up with a 2:34.

darn.

Not what I wanted at all but I got insanely close to beating my teammate. The good part about this meet was that the 800m kind of just took away my nervousness and I wasn't nervous about running the 4x4. okay, so what I forgot to mention earlier is that throughout this season I have been running in the JV 4x400. My times are not amazing (67-71 seconds), but it has been fun and we have done a good job. Today however, we had some competition. We were racing the girls varsity team. Obviously, we did not want to be beaten so we were determined to win. As the gun went off the first leg for our team took off to an early lead while I got into place for the next leg (I'm second by the way), I watched them go and I could see that the girl was starting to gain ground and she soon passed our first leg runner. So as I got the baton I was roughly 20 meters behind the 2nd leg girl. Determined to beat her, I took off down the track running about 95%, I was gaining ground fast. Within 200m I was right behind her but as soon as she heard me she started to pick it up. I so badly wanted to beat her so I kept pushing and pushing even when I was hurting so badly. At last, the final 100m came up and I started to give everything I had left, I was basically tied with her right now and as I handed off the baton I was probably less than a tenth of second away from her. 

This race was really a breakthrough moment for me because it showed me if I had the motivation to beat someone or run a time, I could do it. I needed up running a 65 flat which was fantastic for me and the fastest on my relay team. I was super happy and coach gave me an ""OP"" which means outstanding performance, which he gives out to kids who ran great. 

Now, that was all the background info, it's time to talk about today.

\----

**Today;**

Today I left school a bit after school ended and it was a hot and brutal day. I was not feeling amazing but I was aware that it was my last meet and I needed to do something good. I spent the next hour on the bus and getting my bags situated at the other teams track. I git laced up and ran a few warmup laps, and I thought I was ready to run. 

At about 3:15ish, I got up to the line and the gun went off. and here is how the race went;

**RACE;**

I sprinted 90% for the first 100m and stayed up front about 5 meters behind the leaders (there was only 5 people running this race and the fastest runner's best was only around a 2:10). once I hit the 100m mark I slowed down a bit and drifted. Before this race I set a goal for a 53 seconds first 300m (after the first 100m sprint/start). I was feeling fine and my legs were only just starting to feel tired after the 300m mark and I came down the first home stretch. While running I could feel that I was going a bit slower then I wanted to, but at this point I really didn't feel or think I could speed up. So I ended up running my first 400m in 72 seconds, not a bad time but I had wanted 68 ( 15 + 53 ). Once I hit the second lap my legs were really starting to hurt and my arms were getting tired. I kept trying to pick up the pace/maintain it but my body was slowly running out of steam.

At the 600m mark I was really hurting, I could hear one of my 8th grade teammates right behind me and one was a bit in front (about 4 seconds). The 8th grader behind me was someone who I had beat every time so far so I was a little nervous about his kick. So when I hit the 600m mark I really tried to give it everything I had (Which wasn't much). I was starting to gain a bit of ground and I thought I might be able to get third place! but then, as I started my kick, I realized I didn't have anything left. I physically could not run any faster. I kept pushing and pushing but my body was slowly fading. The rest of the race was me trying not to stop and screaming at myself for letting the 8th grader behind me to pass me in the very last 50 meters. 

It was a very disappointing and depressing moment for me. I had worked really hard and yet, my friends were still faster and getting faster than me. when I heard my time though, I was surprised, a new PR!  2:31.3. But this wasn't what I wanted at all and I had just let two teammates beat me who were in the same grade as me. I sat near my bag for the next twenty minutes and did nothing. My 4x400m went okay I guess, but I didn't beat my record and I ran a 66.6 which is my second best time but once again, not what I wanted at all. 

**Now;**

So, here I am. writing this reflecting on the races and I find myself thinking three things.

1.) It hurts to lose, and I hate it.

2.) what do I have to do to be physically able to beat them

3.) Im actually quite slow

In reply to those thoughts I will do a few things. one, there will always be someone better than you and you are going to lose at some point. Make it so that it's hard for yourself to lose but when you do, don't let it destroy you. two, I haven't been training at all in the off seasons so maybe this season I should work really hard to get faster. three, yes I am. And I need to mentally and physically commit to getting faster. confidence is really a powerful thing and If I can prove that I am fit enough to challenge them I have a shot. 

I am sad that I didn't run and accomplish what I wanted this year but I have had a great time and I can only learn from my mistakes. I will train hard this summer and hopefully run some great times in the cross country season.

AdvancedRunning,PM_ME_WARMASTERALFYN,Can I ever run an OTQ? What will decide that?,"Hi! Sophomore HS runner here (5:32 outdated mile PB, 19:32 XC 5K). I ran a marathon fall last year (wasn't going for speed and I ran with my dad: 5:25. Yes, I felt I could have gone faster). This year (well, this coming year) I want to train for another marathon -- I have more time than I expected to do so, and I think I can go sub-3/maybe BQ. 

I've been looking into what it would take to run an OTQ. It's obviously a long ways off, but I've been reading some articles written by qualifiers saying that I should focus on running one mile at OTQ pace (5:18), then running a 5K at that pace (16:28), then a 10K and so on. I'll absolutely hit the 5:18 target during marathon training this year, and I can probably run 16:28 2 or 3 years from now with luck. My question is: how hard is it from there to continue extending the distance I can run at 5:18? I understand that 32:56 is a decent college road 10K time, and 53:00 will win you small-town 10 miles. From there, obviously a 1:09:30 is a pretty good half and a 2:19 is an amazing full marathon. 

I guess I've never really raced distances over about 10K other than to just run them. Can I expect to improve to the extent that I could run an OTQ?",1623261229
AdvancedRunning,genotopia,Looking for advice on constructing a Daniels' half-marathon training plan,"First, I would like to thank the contributors to this sub for the wealth of advice I have collected over the  past months that have positively impacted my running training. I have come across a specific question that I am struggling to answer on my own...

**Background**

At the beginning of March 2021, based on absorbing information on this sub, I began transitioning from a fairly unstructured approach to running training (though plenty of miles) to one of deliberate and thoughtful planning. I purchased the most recent edition of ""Daniels' Running Formula"" and have found it to be extraordinarily helpful. During the month of March I read and did training ""pre-work"" (mileage building, learning the VDOT system, etc...) and starting April 2021 I began following the  ""Blue Advanced Plan"" configured at 40 miles/week, 6 running days/week, easy runs at 1 hour, long run at 1.5 hours. I have thoroughly enjoyed the system and made much positive progress. The VDOT system appeals to my latent desire (and career training) to be focused on quantitative observations, and thus I have found it motivating. I recently upped my VDOT based on a 5 mile PR extracted from a (non-ideal conditions) trail race I ran over this past weekend.

**Problem Statement**

I have registered for a half-marathon in early October 2021, a distance I have run numerous times, though never in a race. I would like to follow a Daniels' based plan for preparation, likely finishing my current Blue plan to completion and then starting a new plan. However, this leaves me with a few questions that I don't feel I can answer on my own and with the book. The book contains a chapter on 15K - 30K training (the ""Alien"" plan where you design your own with guardrails) and a set of marathon plans, but no dedicated half-marathon plan:

* Do I build my own plan following the 15K - 30K ""Alien"" schematic?
* Do I build a plan based on a marathon plan?
* Regardless of the base plan, do I need to up my weekly mileage beyond 40?
* Do I need to ensure all my long runs are configured to always hit a distance greater than or equal to half-marathon distance?",1623251900

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is The Moneghetti**.

https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/change-up-your-run-with-the-moneghetti-fartlek/

*History*

Named after the famous Australian Distance runner and creator of the workout, Steve Moneghetti (marathon PR: 2:08:16).

*What*

* warmup
* 2 x (90sec on, 90 sec off)
* 4 x (60 sec on, 60 sec off)
* 4 x (30 sec on, 30 sec off)
* 4 x (15 sec on, 15 sec off)
* cooldown

*How*

The goal of the workout is to speed up as you move through each interval - like changing gears in a car. Try to start around 5-8k pace and work your way down to all-out during the 15 second reps (but not so all-out that you lose proper form). The ""off"" portions should be run at your regular easy pace. The total time of the session will equal exactly 20 minutes (not including the wu/cd).

*When*

This workout can be done whenever. The beauty of this fartlek-style workout also means it can be done wherever too! Feeling like you need a rust-buster workout? Do the Moneghetti! Only have a small amount of time? The Moneghetti! Want to go real fast? Moneghetti! Need to do some hill work? I feel sorry for you.",1623244709
AdvancedRunning,217582,How to convert a distance-based training plan to a time-based one?,"Hello everyone!   


I have recently been moving away from running by distance and further to running by time. I sadly lead a busy life and having a grasp of exactly how long I'm going to be out for makes my life less stressful.   


I have been base-building on my own accord during the past couple of months, but in a few weeks I start training for a September Half Marathon which I intend to use Pfitz's HM plan for. The problem here is that his plan is distance based.

I've been trying to slow this down to 5min45 but it's so hard to run that slow!! I find it quite exhausting compared to when I speed up a bit.

AdvancedRunning,Mic-Ronson,Training for fast twitch runner / soccer player,"I will probably post this in track and field for advice on how 400 meter runners, or 800 meter runners train early in the season. But I thought I would give this forum a shot. 

I basically decided that I am really too heavy to be competitive at local races - 5k.  That is I am 5’10”, 190lbs.- lots of muscle, some fat.  Ran briefly in college coming off of soccer season - clocked a 4:13 mile, then got injured for 30 years.  I got better by lifting a lot of weights- specifically squats with excellent form to fix a recalcitrant runner’s knee.  I have been running for about 3 years starting at age 39. I got a lot faster at first as dropped my mile time from a miserable 9:20 to breaking 7:00. MPW was about 25 mpw. 

I haven’t really gotten that much faster since then. A bit hard to handle that my best mile time is 7 minutes which used to be my easy pace at age 19.. Jack Daniels says an age adjusted mile time for 4:13 at age 19 would be about 5 minutes at age 52..But , hey, I can run now where my orthopedist said I would never run. Anyway, I think I have hit terminal velocity at this BMI. I used to be able to lose weight just by running. That’s not happening anymore. I can’t stand dieting. Sure, I could clean up my diet, but I don’t see dropping below 180 without losing a lot of muscle. I got a dexa scan .. 

So I think I am going to just run for fun and conditioning for soccer..My plan is to cut back on mileage, up the pace to marathon pace - about 9:30
with periodic walking breaks instead of 6 miles at a 10:30-10:45 pace. I figure this is closer to soccer and will hit those intermediate twitch muscles more. Also do a lot of strides at the end of these ‘easy days ‘ to keep my fast twitch muscles from atrophying. Perhaps add in a few maximum 10 second hill sprints for power and bounding. One day of a fartlek soccer style run - 30, 20,10 - jog, run, sprint.  Two days of weights.  

I am hoping that’s enough to get into soccer shape. I am thinking the closest thing to soccer would be a 400 meter runner - that is the event is 70 percent aerobic and 30 percent anaerobic.  . However, raw speed is a premium and the best soccer players can compete with 100 meter runners. . But you do need an aerobic base as average player runs about 6 miles a match.. But was wondering if anyone could comment on how 400 meter runners train early season , or if the above seems smart. Thanks .",1623198257

I'm a young runner (college, 3 years in) and I hate it. I had a dream of winning major competitions, but my body is limiting me. I've talked to so many runners because I couldn't figure out why I was finding running so hard amd why I looked different running even though I was getting better every year (rapid beginner gains).

Basically, I'm not build like a runner (I have short legs, long torso and long arms). I thought I would start winning major competitions because I'm skinny and because I work hard, but I honestly feel so tired from the amount of work I have to put in (I haven't told that to anyone). I've invested so much time and so much money because I cared so so much, but according to my coach, it's not normal to struggle this much.

And I feel so jelaous of my brother who is the opposite, his legs are long, and his torso is short. He's has a perfect build, but he doesn't care about it nearly as much as I do. He finds running so easy, speed and form comes easier to him. 

I talked to my coach about my struggles, and he is telling me that one day, all hard work will pay off and it doesn't matter because it's not like I'm going to be winning major competitions. I just don't see a point why should I then put so much work if I'm not going to be winning. I honestly feel so tired from all of it.

Therefore, I wanted to know if anyone can recommend some good books about sport psychology and the mental side of training and racing?

I have done some research and found the following book, but each of them seems to either touch the mental aspect only as a side topic or to be more anecdotal in nature (but maybe you can tell me which of them are still worth picking up):

AdvancedRunning,CPanza01,Temperature Adjusted Pace in Summer,"Now that we're entering summer and the hot and humid runs are right around the corner, I'm curious what method/calculation people use to figure out ""temp adjusted pace"". So, for instance, let's say I run a 10k at 10 min pace and it is 76F and 65 dew point.

1. Some sites (such as Maximum Performance) say add temp + dew (141) and then look up on a [particular chart](http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html) what adjustment to make, so in this instance a 3% adjustment, **which would be 10:18.**
2. Other sites (such as [Podium runner](https://www.podiumrunner.com/training/how-much-does-heat-slow-your-race-pace/)) say those who averaged 7:25 to 10:00/mile slow between 4 and 4.5 seconds per mile for each 1° C (1.8° F) higher than 59° F. So according to this method, my hypothetical 10k run at 10 min pace **would end up between 10:38 and 10:42.**

Between the two sites, using different methods, that's a big difference in adjustment. Even going with Podium Runner's low end (10:38), that's a difference of 20 seconds average pace.

I get that to most people this is no big deal, but I'm in the midst of a long training plan that works primarily on slowly increasing my average pace while staying aerobic (Zone 2). I collect a lot of data to assess longitudinal progress (I write on this at my substack site, [Brief Habits](https://chrispanza.substack.com)), so it's important for me to make temperature adjustments to while we're in the warmer months. So I'd like to make adjustments to my raw data (in the summer) that are realistic. 

Obviously I could just ""pick one"" method and stick it to, which is what I'll surely end up doing. But **which** do you think is more accurate? Or do you use some other method?",1623151469

Training 

I (24M) was definitely not as prepared as I should be. My typical week consists of a few runs between 2 miles and 4 miles with slightly longer runs on the weekends (6 – 10 miles). My weekly mileage fluctuates between 20 to 30 miles. Leading up to this race, I ran 8 miles the Saturday before, 3 miles on Tuesday/Thursday, and 1 mile on Friday (the day before).

Pre-race

I took pre-workout before leaving the house, got there just in time to put on my bib number, and take a few hits of an iced blueberry disposable. I always take a few hits before a run and I have no idea why. I swear I’m not an addict. 

Race

The race was a cool 70˚F and overcast with slight humidity. The course was mostly flat with only 20ft in elevation change. The entire course was on asphalt road. There was a slight drop at the beginning and incline at the end, as it was an out-and-back race. There were around 200 runners but I luckily was able to start in the front of the group. I went out faster than I wanted to but stayed with the front runners for about 2 miles. My legs felt strong the whole race and my breathing was never labored.  

Post-race

I stretched and rolled when I got home accompanied by a foot bath for my sore feet (I run in Xero Z-Treks) and a bottle of the finest chocolate milk. 

What’s Next

I plan on doing more local 5ks or whatever races come available and beginning training for a half marathon. I would like to run a half by the end of September in decent time. Until next report !",1623088543

I haven't ever followed official training plans very religiously, but I am looking for substantial improvement this cycle and decided to pick up Daniel's Running Formula (based on some discussion I saw here) and use his 2Q 18/80 plan (2 quality workouts a week, 18 weeks, peaking @ 80 mpw). 

I have been running 60-70 mpw relatively consistently for a long time, so feel comfortable tackling a peak of 80 mpw.  My question is about his incorporation of marathon pace and tempo pace work into 2 long sessions each week, with 2 longer runs (17-20 miles) every week.  I have always kept long runs to 1x/week and slow, while keeping speedwork and tempo runs to shorter efforts (7-10 miles).  I am a bit concerned about my ability to recover from each of the sessions fully enough to tackle the next (perhaps both mentally and physically, given the high intensity of the sessions).  

Has anyone completed this plan (or a similar one) and able to provide any insight on how they timed the workouts or how they handled multiple longer efforts each week? Any advice or guidance is much appreciated!",1623079387

I need your motivational support. I am 30 years old. My ultimate goal is to run a half marathon under 1:25. Why? I want to beat the legend himself: my father. I've been trying hard since 2011 with a PR so far of 1:28:14 in 2016. 

After my PR I had less fanatical years of training with even one full year break due to a wonderful world trip. In 2020 my determination returned and I started training intensively again. I ran 4 to 5 times a week. As overconfident and especially stupid as I was, I started way too enthusiastic. In no time I started to feel my knee. It's an injury that has kept me sidelined for almost a year now. Meanwhile, I'm getting older and older. My age is catching up on me. Fortunately, my determination is still there. It just feels like I have to start all over again to reach the insanely fast pace to beat my dad's time. 

TL;DR: I was wondering if there are more people who hit their peak form in their thirties?

\### Training

I'm training for my first Sprint Triathlon since 2004, and wanted to have some kind of race prior to that. Because of pool closures, and then pool inconvenience of needing to book specific times, I've focused very heavily on biking and running, only adding swimming pretty recently. 

The running component of my training has mostly focused on each week having a long run (which I've gotten up to around 11 miles, but the past few weeks have been cutting that back down), shorter intervals (the longest of which are 800's), and tempo/longer intervals (which, lately as I'm trying to be more goal-specific, have come in the second half of a bike-run workout). I've been doing about 20-25 miles of running per week most weeks (in addition to 50-60 miles per week on the bike).

\### Race

In New Jersey, the weather has been getting warmer in the afternoons, but it's mostly been pretty cool in the mornings (60's F). This weekend we got our first real hot weather of the year - it was 80 F at time of the start of the race.

The course was pretty flat, with a slight down hill to start and a slight up hill towards the end, but nothing with more than a 1% gradient the whole way. About half of it was shady, and it went through a neighborhood where lots of people had their hoses out spraying runners.

It was a local race, so the starting line wasn't that crowded. There was a group of ""good"" runners that I let go early, and quickly found myself in a no-man's land in 7th. I was able to hold a decent pace through the middle, and when we came out onto more of a straight, I saw another runner in front of me a bit. I was able to real him in, and caught him on a last little hill with a little more than 400 left. 

Finishing in 20:40, this was faster than any of the 5K time trials I've been running for myself, with the next fastest at 22:04 (which was in April). It's a ways off my all-time PR of around 17:45 I ran in high school, but I'm still happy with the big improvement from April and even bigger improvement from this time last year, where just getting under 25:00 was pretty tough. It's amazing how much progress 1 year of consistency can lead to!

Is there something better I could be doing with the Garmin to make sure I stay on pace for my race?",1623070492
AdvancedRunning,gregnegative,"Is it really possible to change running form, or would you try if you thought you were going to get hurt if you didn't?","I coach kids' cross country and track, and I have sworn the coaches' version of the 'do no harm' oath.

However... my daughter is a runner who is about to go into high school.  She, my son and I all run about 16 miles a week together so I get to see first-hand her running form.  She has really weak hips and it causes her to 'plod' her runs, with her foot coming down hard onto the pavement to the point where you can hear it.

The issue is that now that we are slowly increasing mileage to build up to her first high school season, I believe that this is going to increasingly become a problem.  It doesn't take Jay Dicharry himself to see what the problem is in her gait, and what muscles need to be helped.

Due to an upcoming change in work arrangements it's going to be much easier for me to hit my mileage goals (50-60mpw) if I do the bulk of my miles early morning, ideally 6am or thereabouts. 

Trouble is, I am NOT a morning person. I sleep pretty well, and am generally awake by say 6.30 but feel as though my legs in particular aren't in any way lively enough to do anything more than shuffle around the house until at least 8.30am, let alone run. Ordinarily I run afternoon/evening at which time I feel pretty loose

I guess my question is, do any of you guys have any tips/experience in making the move to morning mileage? Is there anything I can do (beyond coffee and a shower) which can spark my legs in to life for an hour of easy running at the ungodly hour of 6am?

AdvancedRunning,coasttrash404,Is it a problem that my legs feel bad all the time? (Building up mileage),"Yesterday I was rereading Faster Road Racing and saw the line about LT runs that says if you're sore and stiff the next day, you did it too hard. Oh no, I thought, because I am sore and stiff almost every day. Am I doing something wrong, or is that just a feature of building up your mileage?

I (26F) did my first marathon in December (3:48) and got up to around 50 mpw a few times during that cycle, but really wasn't consistent enough especially about mid-week mileage. Since February, I've averaging about 40 mpw since then and hitting 45-50 on higher-mileage weeks. I've been a lot more consistent and my long run is always less than 30% of the week's total mileage. 

The problem is, 45-50 isn't really starting to feel easier. I still feel achey and sore more days than not, and sometimes my legs feel so dead that the running just isn't fun. During a week where I hit, say, 48 miles, I might feel great all week including through the long run at the end, but then the next week struggle through every run from the accumulated fatigue. 

I am planning to build to 65 mpw before I start a Pfitz half marathon plan at the end of August. 

My question: Should I just expect my legs to feel bad for this whole period as I keep building mileage? Or should I be making changes so that I'm recovering more noticeably between runs and not feeling beat up all the time?

\### Background

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Coming off a 10k TT about 6 weeks ago, the plan was to train for a 1600 and get as close to 5min as possible. Both the 10k and 1600 were just something different to do before I head back into marathon training. More extensive background here for those interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/msw5pd/10k\_time\_trial\_solo\_3717/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/msw5pd/10k_time_trial_solo_3717/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

Was actually planning to do this TT last weekend but I strained my calf about 4 weeks ago. Didn't run for a week and couldn't really do workouts for another week. I'd say I lost about 3 weeks of training since it took me awhile to trust my calf muscle. Pushed the TT to the morning of 6/5 since I had my 2nd covid shot scheduled. Then I would take 6/6 off before I start marathon training.

&amp;#x200B;

But, as noted in the title, there were 2 attempts at the 1600! For those not in NYC, 6/5 was a very hot and humid day. I DNF'd my attempt on 6/5. Was pretty annoyed about it for most of the day since I knew I wouldn't attempt a 1600 TT until some time after my September marathon. I got my 2nd Pfizer shot in the late morning. Kept waiting throughout the afternoon and evening for the side effects to hit but they never did. Decided I would make an attempt again in the morning if I felt okay. Went out at a much more conservative pace to ensure that I would finish.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, I'm feeling the side effects of the vaccine as I'm typing this but glad I finished the TT. That's it for this section. I find the next few sections more interesting when reading other Race Reports so hope ya'll enjoy! 

\###  Training

For the most part, I stayed around 45-55 mpw. As much as I wanted to train for the 1600, running is therapeutic for me and I didn't want to cut down my mileage too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coming off the 10k TT, I felt strong. Plan was to do 3 workouts a week  + a long run:

\-Tempo (4-5 miles)

\-Speed session (8-10x200) or hill sprints

\-Longer intervals mixed with speed (something like 3-4x 1K followed up by 4-5x 300s)

\-Long run (12-14)

I definitely made a couple mistakes here which I think caused my calf strain about 3 weeks into this training schedule. trained my calf in the middle of a 2x (800, 4x400) session. Really should limit myself to no more than 2 workouts/week and 1 long run. I believe that I do take my easy days easy, but with 3 workouts/week and the long run, I don't think I had enough time to recover between sessions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also typically scheduled the harder interval sessions on Saturday and the long run on Sunday. For the long runs, I don't look at my watch other than to check distance. The first few miles would always feel like shit since I'm still recovering from the previous day's workout. But then all of a sudden, I'm warmed up and start cruising. Check my watch afterwards and there would be 8-10 miles between 6:30 and 6:50 pace. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I healed from the calf strain, I shifted back to 2 workouts + 1 long run. 

\### Pre-race

Nothing really special. Didn't drink alcohol for 2 weeks (except for the Champions League final. I'm a Chelsea fan so had to celebrate). Abstaining for 2 weeks made a big difference for my 10k TT. And my Whoop scores reflect this as well. Same warmup for both attempts. 2-3mi jog, drills, and 4-5 80m strides. Took an electrolyte drink beforehand since it's been hot and humid.

\### Race

6/5 -Attempt 1: Laced up my spikes and the plan was to hold 75s for as long as possible. Went through 200 in 37s and felt good. 75 on the dot through 400. Right around 600, I started panicking. It was about 70 degrees and 90% humidity. Haven't run in this heat yet all year and wasn't ready to suffer for the rest of the race. Got through 800 in 2:31 and called it. Felt really anxious and kind of spooked myself for the pain that I would have to suffer for the next 800. Was very annoyed at the end of the race but whatever. Bad days happen but I had immediate regrets for not finishing.

6/6-Attempt 2: Changed up a couple things here. I just wanted to finish the race so I'd have a recent time to benchmark against for future attempts. Plan was to hold 80s laps through 800 and then pick up the effort with 600 left. Close hard with 250. I also wore my Adidas Adios Pro instead of spikes. After yesterday's failure, I wanted something more comfortable than track spikes. Race pretty much went as planned. Progressed well each lap and finished in 5:12. This time actually matches my VDOT exactly for my 10k TT equivalent.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Recap and other learnings

\-I knew getting under 5:00 for 1600 was going to be a stretch. The calf strain really tampered with my training block (Losing fitness + missing key workouts) . By the time I recovered, I was so worried that I didn't have enough speed for 5:00 so spent more time on shorter intervals (200s, 300s, 400s) but I think needed more sessions at longer efforts (800, 1ks) at 3k/5k pace as well. I can do 10x200 at 32-33 sec with 1 min recoveries fairly comfortably. But I tried doing 8x400 at 75s with 1 min break and only got through 4 reps.

\- No more than 2 workouts/week: Just too much load on my body and couldn't recover. Staying healthy is most important!

\-Stay disciplined on long runs: Should look at my watch more to keep me honest about my effort/pace

\-Longer interval sessions: Really need to add more 800s/1k repeats to build up the stamina at these faster paces

\-Spikes vs road racing shoes: I feel like my legs may not be strong enough yet to use spikes for 1600. Used spikes various times during my training sessions but during the 1st attempt, they felt uncomfortable. Whereas with the Adios Pro, I wasn't thinking at all about my shoes at all and certainly felt fast enough. I think there something to be said about having one less thing to think about while racing/running TTs. 

\-Adjust for weather: Like I said earlier, haven't run in high humidity yet this year. To shoot for 75s per lap while knowing it would be a stretch combined with the heat was a very naive decision. 

\-Perspective: It's been about a year and a half since I started running again after a \~10 year hiatus. I could barely run a 90s 400 when I started running again so overall, I'm still happy with my time.

\### What's next?

It's kind of funny. After my 10K TT, I was really looking forward to training for the 1600. But having to do these faster workouts more frequently was exhausting. The pain from running 400s at 1600 pace is very different from running long tempos or 2 mile repeats. Hopping back into Marathon training tomorrow. Will hope to make my debut and hit a BQ in September. Depending on if I hit a BQ time, may make another attempt at the 1600 towards the end of this year.

AdvancedRunning,matt_tgr,Achilles tendon warmup?,"(Tl;dr at the bottom) A'ight boys and girls, i think i'm about to add another injury to my growing list of injuries to my useless legs. Been recovering from a fractured metatarsal and now i'm starting to have some pains with the achilles tendon (run on the roads, looking over the shoulder for cars, guess that's not the best form, thus leading to slight pain somewhere down there). 

ANYWAY, gonna have my first run tomorrow since experiencing that pain, and I guess I'll find out then whether it's manageable or i need to go back to cross training, *again*. So in order to set myself up the best i can before the run, I need some advice on warming up that tendon before and after the runs. 

Oh I guess I should mention the basics - been building back up slowly after the fracture, doing 100% easy runs with 5-6 strides mixed in the middle of the runs 4 times a week, current mileage 16mi, set to increase to 20mi from 14th Jun.

Tl;dr: Does anyone have some good routines for pre/post-run routines for the achilles tendon?",1622994334
AdvancedRunning,Dull_Cheesecake4982,"Tips on how to get into the ""flow state"" quicker","Hi, picked up serious running for close to 2 years now. Weekly mileage is around 50km as of now. I've noticed that for most of my medium to long steady runs, it takes quite long, about (25-30 min in ) before I start to hit that ""flow state"" whereby you just cruise along (pace, hr, breathing, RPE remains fairly constant) and you can just enjoy the run. My breathing does not feel consistent during that period, with bouts of slightly harder then slightly easier (albeit at the same 4:4 rate), then suddenly deeper then shallow. for a moment i feel like im cruising then suddenly I feel like im starting to put in more effort than I needed but then im cruising, its really weird. All this whilst my pace is steady but my hr fluctuates slightly due to the non consistent breathing.

This is even after I had done proper bouts of warming up that included dynamic stretches, drills and elevating my heart rate. I need some tips on how I can hit this ""flow state"" faster so that the first part of my run dont always seem to fluctuate wildly.

is my body not warmed up enough? or is this something that can be trained? or is this like a mental thing? It does not really affect my training progress but just something that I hoped could be improved in some way.",1622990268

Tried pads, physical therapy, cremes, resting, icing, excercises,..........been to 3 doctors, each said its metatarsal something, last one said it wasnt mortons neuroma cause it didnt pass that press test. 

Had an ultrasound (no luck), now i will get MRI next week finally.

AdvancedRunning,ed-t-,Data Ecosystem,"CONTEXT

Let me just say up top that I’m not an especially data-obsessive type. While I’m running I am guided primarily by pace but also by RPE. However, I do like diving into the data post-run, and I like seeing the big/ long-term picture in my training. 

I also got a Stryd pod recently, MOSTLY so that I could have more accurate pace data, but it also means I have all this running dynamics data (leg spring stiffness, ground contact time, etc) which I would like to analyse.

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT ECOSYSTEM

I plan my season and build my workouts in TrainingPeaks which syncs beautifully with my Coros Pace 2 watch. Coros also has excellent (maybe the best?) native Stryd compatibility which makes collecting all that sweet data a breeze. I also use TP to analyse my post-run data. 

Basically, it goes like this: TP -&gt; Coros -&gt; RUN -&gt; Coros -&gt; TP. 

&amp;#x200B;

THE CHALLENGE

TrainingPeaks, as far as I can tell, doesn’t support all of the Stryd data. It does “power” quite well, but the only option for the other running dynamics data is to make a scatter plot for an individual run. I don’t think there’s a way to plot something like average LSS over time.

This means I need yet another platform to take advantage of all my hard earned data.

Ideally I would like to plan my workouts and analyse my data in the same place, and if that’s not possible, to do so in the simplest, cheapest way.

&amp;#x200B;

THE (BAD) OPTIONS

1. Wait for TrainingPeaks to build in full Stryd support.

2. Wait for Coros to build in Final Surge support. FS has full Stryd integration, but Coros can’t currently import workouts from FS, only export run data. FS is free for athletes so this would be ideal.

3. Use TP plus WKO5. Please no. I’d rather take up badminton.

4. TP + Stryd subscription. Stryd’s workout builder is nowhere near TP standards, so I’d need to keep TP for that, then use Stryd for the analysis. This is a very expensive option.

Am I missing something? Has anyone else already solved this problem?",1622926095
AdvancedRunning,Byrne_XC,"Mentally, how do you move past a failure of a season?","Hey all! Racing and track/xc is a huge mental sport, and I feel like we’ve all been let down quite a few times, and also bounced back.

My spring season just finished today, and I’m struggling to find a single silver lining to it. I’m in my early/mid 20s and run for a club, and raced 4 800s this season, all 2:00-2:01. My PR of 1:57 came last spring, so I’m not THAT far removed from it. I’m just really upset and annoyed that I went out and raced 4 times and ran like dogshit all 4 times. Now I have to go into summer training with that stink on me, and probably not race another 8 until winter.

I stopped running years back. Work got in the way, stress, I got a rare disease (PVNS) that caused a tumor to eat through my femur (yeah, that big thigh bone). I had a BMI of &lt;20 and no significant wear on the ball or socket. With 60% of femoral neck gone, I got a total hip replacement.

I'm 9mo post op and have been active with home repairs, digging ditches, chopping wood. Riding a bike for 20 puts me on a cane the following day so I took a break for 2 months (plus, what runner likes to bike? :p )

I've read that the reason running is not recommended for people with a THR is there hasn't been enough runners to form meaningful opinions. With that said, I'm trying again.

I went for a slow 10min run today (5 out and back). After 4 min I was fine except I could feel the new femor stem in my thigh. Has anyone gotten past this is have views?

AdvancedRunning,chaosdev,Do any of the new gadgets help you prescribe or adjust your training?,"There's a lot of gadgets that can tell you a lot of information now. I'm thinking of metrics like ""heart rate variability,"" ""acute-to-chronic workload ratio,"" or ""body battery."" This data is great for describing your training, but may not be good at prescribing it. Do you use any metrics to help inform daily or weekly training decisions?

This post is inspired by a quote by Boston Marathon champion Amby Burfoot:

&gt; What is all our new running data good for if we can’t prescribe? I mean, if my 10x400 workout gets slower every week, my morning heart rate increases, my hours of sleep decrease, I can prescribe from this data: It’s time to take two weeks off. But I could assess all the above in 1970 with a $7.99 Timex wristwatch with a sweep second hand. Have we made any advances in running and training data since then?

I have access to a lot of data about my running.  I can check esoteric measurements like ground contact time or heart rate recovery.  But at the end of the day, I still mostly follow a structured training plan like in Daniels Running Formula, with few modifications.

So the question: What feedback do you use to prescribe or adapt your training? Which metrics are just distractions? Which metrics help you to change your training on a daily or weekly basis?

Examples with some potential include:

- _Resting heart rate_: As Amby Burfoot mentioned, if your resting heart rate stays elevated for several days, you may need extra recovery days.
- _Garmin's ""Recovery Time""_: This tells you how long you need to recover before your next big workout.
- _Garmin's ""Training Status""_: Supposedly this tells you if your training is ""unproductive,"" ""productive,"" ""overreaching,"" or several other options. I've heard this is notoriously unreliable.
- _Heart rate variability_: Some [limited evidence](https://www.outsideonline.com/2302726/how-heart-rate-variability-tells-you-when-hammer) suggests that you should back off when your heart rate variability drops by 30% or more.
- _Heart rate recovery_: This is just how long your heart takes to recover after a serious workout. This metric seems to be inversely correlated with recovery status; longer heart rate recoveries indicate you are not recovering well. [\[source\]](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/heart-rate-recovery/)
- _Acute-to-chronic workload ratio_: Previous research suggests that a ACWR of 0.8 - 1.3 is ideal for avoiding injury. If you ACWR is low (0.8 - 1.05), then you may be able to increase training intensity/volume. [\[source\]](https://www.outsideonline.com/2411261/injury-prevention-acute-chronic-workload-ratio-research)
- _Total stress management_: I'm thinking of tools like Whoop, that try to track your total stress. Based on DCRainmaker's review of Whoop, I'm pretty skeptical.",1622893697

### Training 
Started building the base when Corona hit last year and my commute by bike and weekly trips to the pool had to be laid on ice. For reference, I went from a rough average of 30km/week (19miles/week) in 2019 to 70km/week (44miles/week) in late January 2021. With this base I started to follow Pfitzinger’s 18/55 on 1st of February this year and did so very faithfully. I have not missed a workout except for a recovery run and day in the last week since I moved the marathon from Sunday to this Friday. Initially I started the training just to see if I can take it and then to take the experience into another training cycle for the Paris Marathon later this year (hopefully). The training, however, went exceptionally well. There were no injuries and only mild naggings (a tight left hip flexor after the faster runs, that I dealt with by replacing my old Kinvaras with Adidas Adios 4 and some targeted stretching). I also felt I adequately recovered from the harder sessions quite fast by taking those slow days slow. This was the first time after a long while that I strictly followed a training plan. Usually, I would just throw in some long runs in the weeks prior to a race.

Thoughts on my goal: I knew sub3 should be possible from consistently finishing my HMs in the 1:22-1:24 region. My prior FM PR I consider very lucky given the low training volume I had put into, and it was just me hanging in the final half of the race. This is why I thought it quite possible to go sub3 with enough effort put into the preparation.

The hardest run from the training was the final 32km (20mile) long run. I chose this one to coincide with the Wings For Life Run which, after a never ending winter, fell on an abnormally hot day here in Germany. With the race starting at 13:00P.M. it was just SO hot that I drank all my water by km 20. The last 4 km I was in delirium. Still, I managed to only get caught by the catcher car at km 32. For the TTs I did a 15k in 59:15, a 10k in 38:12 and a 5k in 18:19. With the last two being slightly improvements of my PRs. During the last two weeks of the training, I took the decision to see these times as promising precursors and decided to finish the training with a Marathon and not let the training go untested.


### Pre-race
I got up at 05:00 a.m. had a coffee and overnight oats with an apple. I had intended to start the race at 06:00, but in the end I waited until 6:30 to poop, but it never happened. I figured by then it wouldn’t be a big deal during the race (decision based on prior experience) and that otherwise I would lose the cool morning hours. I went to a local forest where I planned to run the race in 3x 11.6km (7 miles) and a final 7.4km (4.5 miles) course. I setup my bike as an aid station with 2x 0.5l bottles of isotonic drinks. I carried a running backpack with 0.5l of water, 3 gels, a cereal bar, my phone, and a mask. This was my tried configuration from the training long runs. I started the run at 07:00 a.m. sharp.

### Race
The course was pretty flat with an elevation increase/decrease of 25m. About 55% of the surface was asphalt and 45% the forest gravel path. 

First half of the course was on the increasing slope of the asphalt road and the remainder decreasing slope through the forest back to the start. On my first round I went out quite fast with a pace of 4:10min/km (6:43min/miles) but after some readjusting finished the round with an average pace of 4:13min/km (6:47min/miles). 

On the second round the increasing slope hit me quite hard and I struggled to reach 4:15min/km (6:50min/miles). However, the downward slope allowed me to make up the lost seconds and I finished the HM distance at about 1:29:08. By the time I finished my second round (23.2km) fate struck and my watch lost GPS signal. According to the watch from one km to the next I inexplicably slowed down from 4:13 to 4:45min/km. Note, I use the Garmin Vivoactive 3 and this is not a rare phenomenon where my watch apparently drops the GPS and I think instead of finding it again goes of of the cadence (and some algorithm I guess). Usually this is always in the same ballpark of the previous pace, but not this time. I had to rely on Plan B, my phone that was also tracking. So, I connect my headphones and get the pace read out to me. Luckily, my feeling was right, and I was still on track to finish with 4:15min/km or faster. 

I push onward. Probably because my mind was trying to make sense of the issue the next kms just flew by. At km 31 my SO waited with her bike to support and pace me. This way I can also get some water splashed on me (by now the forest shade had receded to the sun glaring down on me). At the end of round 3 (33.8km, 21miles) not fate but my stupidity struck when I decided to drop my backpack at my bike to head into the last stretch unburdened but did so with my phone still in it. I went through this moment so many times in my head the day before in order to remember taking the phone out, but my numb mind only remembered to hold on to the headphones that without the phone proved very useless… I also only noticed the missing phone when I was 800m (half mile) out from the start. At this point my SO headed back to retrieve it (in case someone took it). So, without the watch correctly tracking me, I had now also lost my phone and my SO for controlled pace management. 

I was heading into the last 6km super frustrated and flabbergasted at how this could have gone so wrong lol. I guess the frustration and my will to beat whatever pace my watch was serving me (4:20min/km…) kept me going. Without the backpack I was still quite hot, so I took of my shirt. A good sign on the horizon was then when I realized that I reached km 39 (mile 24) without hitting the wall. This was also when my SO reached me again with water to drink and splash on me. 

Now, only the last 3 km remained which were a straight path on asphalt followed by 200m on a gravel road to the finish line I had set for myself. I told her to pace me so that my pace would not drop below 4:15, but according to her I was doing 4:10min/km anyway with no signs of fatigue. I passed the finish line at 2:58:27, but went on for another ~200m so that my watch would also register 42.2.km which it clocked in at 2:59:21.

### Post-race
I was happy to have beat the sub3 challenge within a good margin of error given the complication I put myself into. Since the rounds are all premeasured and tried, I think the wall time at which I passed the finish line is the new PR I set for myself. I feel confident going into another training cycle to prepare to clock another sub3 marathon at an official race (hopefully Paris this year so I can benefit the most from the intense training of this spring). I am really astonished by how well the race went. Given that most of the distance I was on my very own with a backpack weighing me down. I had never run a Marathon without hitting the wall at some point before. I am also astonished at how short the race felt. It did definitely not feel like the 42.2km I had known from 8 prior marathons. I must have entered some deep state of flow. For the main bulk of kms the time just flew by. But I guess the hard and qualitative training are what made this all possible.

The benefits of the solo marathon are quite noteworthy, being able to adjust the starting time according to weather and bowel movement and the ability to run shirtless stack up quite well against the solitude and weight of the backpack. The whole endeavor, like many other things of the last year+, however felt a little anticlimactic and in the end, I still miss the crowds and cannot wait to get back to the road racing from before.

Another last info on my training and race. I was listening to James Joyce's Ulysses (and analysis) for some 30h+ of extra psychological torment during my training. the end of the audio play I listened to during the first half of the race and was glad to have been able to finish two (personal) Odysseys in a day.

### Background

M40, 170cm, 80kg, smoker, drink lots of beer, always hated running, only ran on school and in the army. One year ago I started running and never stopped since then.

From June to December 2020, I ran mostly by feeling and designed my own HM training plan, I felt terrible almost the time but I achieve my goal of a sub 2 HM. 75kgs now.

I always run solo.

### Training

I started with the Garmin/Full Potential Hear Rate based Intermediate Marathon Plan, but only followed this plan for about 3 weeks, it was to easy and I was not getting faster. 

After a little digging, I found RunWithHal App and choose Hal Higdon Marathon Advanced 1 plan. Much better to me, not big fan of the workout distribution during the week, but soon after I started to see results. I which there were longer long runs, 32k didn’t prepare me for 42k. What I didn’t liked at all was the tapering, too long and too easy for me and in the end I believe this was the cause for not performing well on the time trial.

### Pre-race

I was feeling good so I decided to go for 50k, 3k warmup, 43k marathon time trial, 4k cool down. My first concern, my running vest weighs 5kg.

### Race

1k-8k: Warmup was horrible, my left leg didn’t want to run, so painful (probably shin splits) that I wanted to abort and try again on weekend. I forgot that was a holiday in Portugal that day, so the sidewalks were I planned the 10k loop was crowded, so I decided to take another route.

9k-16k: Finally no more pain on my left leg and faster than expected, I try to not to go so fast. 50k is still on the table.

17k-21k: I had headwind almost on the first half of the route, but was especially hard on these 4k, but still feeling strong and a pace on target.

22k-31k: A little tired, but everything’s OK.

32k-39k: This become my longest run ever at 33k and I thought that I hit the wall, couldn’t be more wrong, I was just tired and my pace only dropped a little and still on target. 50k is not on the table anymore, Plan B 46k, and if I can keep my pace at 5:30/km-5:40/km, I’m going for a very good time.

40k-42.34k: Oh shit, I hit the wall badly, everything hurts, I just want to stop, I start to question my life choices, I’m not going for 46k anymore, I just want to finish. On the last meters I was googling marathon distance to end the run as soon as possible. 

### Post-race

I never felt so badly after a run, I just wanted to lay down on the ground, the pain on my legs was atrocious.

### Future

For the next 12 months I don’t have any particular objectives which require hard training, keep up my progress on CityCtrides, run that 50k at a slower pace (6:00/km), try Trail running. Maybe in 2022 I sign up for Lisbon Marathon and try to run it sub 3:30.

**Training**

Had a decent winter training cycle but generally without formal races and an entire year of time trials, motivation was pretty low. Spent a few weeks doing random hard efforts and taking it easy. Started getting a bit more serious as the winter weather warmed up by March but of course, by end April, Toronto was already getting 20+ Celsius days.

Had some niggling IT band issues through March-May, likely from extremely tight TFL and glute muscles. Forced me to push out the 5K TT and finally, managed to plan for early June. Of course, Toronto skipped most of spring and had multiple 30C days (that is 86F for the Muricans).

Had a few strong workouts but surprisingly, had two not very good workouts right before the TT. One was a 2 x 2KM at 3:00/KM, 2 x 1KM at 2:55/KM. Except for the first interval, was off all the paces by 5-10 seconds. Combination of heat, general lack of motivation, and overall fatigue. Lots of lactic acid headaches.

Needless to say, not an ideal training cycle for an ambitious goal (would have been a 30+ second PB)

**Pre-race**

Tried to pick the coolest day in the week which was Fri morning - around 19C (66F). Not ideal running weather but not terrible either.

Banana and coffee for breakfast. Decent warmup and strides, met my running buddy who was going to run with me, few strides, and based on the beating sun already out, decided to get er over with.

**Race**

Goal was to run even splits at 3:00/KM. The second half of the race was going to be under the open sun and I knew I did not want to rely on a big negative split.

The first 500m was shady and a slight cool headwind, and I felt absolutely amazing. Went through 500m in 1:25 and pulled back a bit to hit 1KM right at pace. Second KM had a bit of downhill and while it went through right on pace, I was starting to feel the heat (tingling on skin, slight light headedness).

KM 3 was rough. It involved crossing lights, a wide turn-around and a 250m uphill (not massive but noticeable). This KM just sucked. I was breathing hard and was not enjoying myself. Solid 7 seconds off pace.

KM 4 was absolute miserable. Open sun, no wind, stuffy, and I was just not happy. If my buddy hadn't been 5-10m behind me, I would have quit. My buddy called ""one mile left"" and  that gave me a bit of energy. 8 seconds off pace and I knew I wasn't going to be able to make up15 seconds in the last km. But I could still get a PB and that was on my mind.

KM 5 was just the pain cave that only the 5KM brings on. Pukey, legs heavy, just looking to finish. Seeing the finish line gave me a last burst and I managed a very strong last 200M to finish in 15:20.

**Post-race**

Was a rough next 5 min, lying on the grass next to the road. My buddy finished in 15:22 and was very happy as well.

Was happy to get a PB off a not great training cycle. Could probably have shaved another 5-10 seconds off in cooler conditions but I wasn't ready for 14:59 yet. I can admit that and look at adjustments for a future training.

At least I now broken the tie with /u/Chiron17, my Reddit foe from across the world lol. Buddy, ball's in your court.

AdvancedRunning,800ToGo,Anyone looking for coaching or another set of eyes to go over your training plan?,"Hi there,
This is the third or fourth time now I have offered to help anyone looking for training advice/coaching on Reddit. My background is mostly mid distance and cross country, however I’ve helped plan out training now for individuals training for everything from the 800 to 50k ultramarathons. If anyone here would like coaching, help writing up a plan, or just another set of eyes to look at your training plan and give feedback then feel free to hit me up. I think this is currently a great time of year to reassess training and set yourself up for a fall of fast racing. Personally I think my background would make my guidance most helpful for a high school or collegiate runner who doesn’t have a formal coach or is looking for a second opinion, however I’m happy to help anyone at any age or level.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in feel free to comment on this post or DM me. I’ll try my best to get back to everyone as quickly as I can!",1622825087

### Training
I've been helping coach (more like just volunteering to run with than actually coaching) with a local high school track team this Spring (which propelled me to my [2:52 Carmel Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/mjl3rp/2021_carmel_marathon_or_wow_so_many_people_or/)) so I've mostly been doing the workouts with the kids. 400s at mile or just below. Ks at vo2. LT/tempo runs. The occasional speed day of ripping through some 300s. Strides after base runs. After the marathon my mileage has been 29-55-55-55-60-66-65-38 - and in case you're wondering, yes I am paying the invoice for that way-too-quick rebuild. I didn't want to miss time running with the kids. My race was last night and the Indiana high school state meet is this weekend so I will take some time and rest up now. 

About a month ago I TT'd a 1600 and PR'd with a 5:08, I ran it alone and it was extremely windy that day so I felt like with a little better conditions, maybe slightly less tired legs, and a race environment (or at least some people to key off of), I would be knocking on the doorstep.

One other confidence building workout we did was a little 3mi tempo, followed immediately by a 600m at 800m race pace. Never having raced an 800, I just got out hard and tried to beat some kids, and came through at ~1:39. That's not particularly impressive or anything but I extrapolated that to 2:15-2:20 for an 800 and felt like I was in a good spot.

Tuesday, I did a workout with some friends and did 8x400 @ 69-70 and that went pretty well so I figured I was, again, in the ballpark.

### Race Strategy
I'm interested to hear if anyone has any 'race/pace strategy' for a straight road mile. I wasn't really racing for placement, so there wasn't much from that perspective. My only strategy was to get out fast and try to stay near the front-ish.

### Race
They had clocks set up at the quarter miles, which was nice because otherwise I'd have had no idea. I didn't want to trust my watch with distance/pacing over that short/quick a race. I knew I just needed to run fast lol. Sometimes it's just that simple. We got out at the gun and no one really pulled away from me, so I thought we were going out ""slow,"" or maybe right at/under 5:00 pace. When the quarter mile clock appeared in the distance and I saw it in the 50s I could only think ""Oh, shit."" Ended up crossing at ~68 before ultimately settling in to that 75/quarter pace.

I could feel it get harder in the 3rd quarter but I was in a better place than I normally would be on the track, which can feel interminable at times. Chin down. Good form. Have to push to maintain. In the fourth quarter I could feel it get *really* hard. But again, had no sense of my pace. The finish line was in sight (as it had been since the start, hah) and I wondered what I had left. I got close enough to see that I didn't think I was gonna make it. Alas, still a PR.

Wait, that's the wrong attitude to have. If it was going to be that close, I could try to pick it up and maybe sneak under. I think I came to this conclusion at actually the optimal point; guesstimating that it was with 200-150m left to go, so I kicked it home and crossed at.... I'm not sure. It was *right* at it...

I went over to the little results printout area and gave my bib number. ""Tell me that number starts with a four,"" I said. The guy waited with bated breath as he looked up the number... and then gave me a high-five as the (preliminary) results read 4:59.80 (official results ended up saying 4:58.41). Either way, I did it! Woohoo! 

### What's next?
I'm going to cheer on our kids at the Indiana state meet this weekend and not run for a few days. ""Coaching"" track has given me a real hankering to do something competitive. So I'd like to hop in some more local races this summer as they begin to return. I'm signed up for an 8-hour race in mid-July that I'm going to do; and then there's a 5K road race that benefits the high school I've been helping at and I'd like to go very low 17s or sub-17 if I can. My BQ-7:19 wasn't good enough, I didn't sign up for Chicago, and NY isn't doing time qualifiers so my fall plans aren't set; so I'll probably do the Indy Monumental by default (it's awesome, don't get me wrong! I had just hoped to do one of the big'ns).",1622811481
AdvancedRunning,muraviov,Looking for suggestions for Fitness App.,"Hey, fellow athletes! 

I'm currently developing an Android application (iOS also in the future) that will allow seeing better statistics of the sports I'm doing (running, biking, swimming, HIIT) based on Google Fit data. The base idea that I want to use separate apps for tracking activities that best suit them and a separate app for gathering all activities to track my progress and see results in one place.

First of all, I'm developing this app for myself but I think that it could be useful to other people and so I want to ask you if have any needs for a better statistic app than what you are using right now.

Features that I need to satisfy my needs:

* Totals for different sports for any period
* Personal records like the longest streak
* Average data for miles per week, etc
* Chart of how much percentage take different activities
* Goals tracking for different periods (like run x per week and y in total for the season)
* My overall body appearance progress tracking with before/after photos
* A widget that will show my goals and progress towards them on the phone home screen

AdvancedRunning,arsenalastronaut,"Need some race registration advice...do the Half Marathon, or Full?","Was signed up for the local Marathon in May 2020...through several postponements, is now slated for September 2021. 

I was planing to cycle a lot more this summer. Running in the heat is a bit hard anyways. And I don't want to miss out on cycling for running...finally, I'm doing all of it for recreation only. 

Realistically, I'll be able to run 2 or 3 7K runs midweek, and a long (~17 to 30K) run on weekends. This equates to 25 MPW or so. Very, very low for a Marathon. But, I will also be cycling 5 to 7 hours a week at a pretty high pace and heart rate. I'm confident in my aerobic base. 

I basically did this last summer, and got a HM personal best. 1:33:32 

My goal in doing the Marathon would be to finish in 3:30 or so. I'm not so worried about my time for that distance. Really, just looking to be a Marathon finisher, and not walk at all during the race.

I am from Cleveland, so this will be about 2000ft of elevation difference and it will include the weekend when I am supposed to be doing my longest run of training. My questions are:
1) What can I do to aid me with the drastic temperature and elevation difference? I have handheld and vest hydration packs, as well as my preferred, tried and tested electrolyte supplements. I’m just a little worried about going from ~50°/60° with humidity to 80° and dry heat.

AdvancedRunning,letsplaypoolny,Picking a plan for Chicago marathon - Goal 2:55,"Hey everyone -

I am about to start the 18 week cycle of training for Chicago this year, and I am looking to try for that elusive BQ. I am 30, and got into running relatively late (in 2015). Marathon time progression:

* 2015 - Philly 4:07 (I did not train properly for this one)
* 2018 - NYC 3:17 (trained with Hanson's Advanced for this one)
* 2020 - Napa 3:03 (trained with Hanson's Advanced for this one too)

I have been injury free and been maintaining a 45-50 MPW throughout 2020-now. I have built a steady base over the past three years (annual mileage \~1800 in 2019, 2500 in 2020). I run shorter races here in NYC with the Road Runners and have been seeing my PRs tick down across the board (slowly) so I don't feel like hit a plateau yet. All that said I would really love to use the fact that I've been able to be consistent and injury free to maximize my chances in getting \~2:55.

Why I want to try something other than Hanson's despite it working well in the past: on the Napa race I was with the sub 3 group of runners until \~21/22 miles and then I definitely had to slow down to finish.

For the past few months I have been participating in my high schools track program. I will say, I am not the fastest runner out there (not by a long shot) but I enjoy it a lot. I run the 4x400m and the 800m. I have had some pretty good times for those events but the place where I fall short or lose a position is always in the finishing 150m. 

I am a pretty fast sprinter if I am just running a 100m. I would say I can run around a 13 second 100m dash but that it without running a good distance before that.

How can I improve my kick at the end of a fast and tiring race.

What are some good training methods to have a faster sprint finish for middle distance races?

AdvancedRunning,brown-ale,Unexpectedly ran a sub 90 minute half this week - What can I do to maintain that pace for another 13.1 miles?,"So before i get into the details, I just want to put it out there that I am completely shocked and still excited that I ran a half marathon in 1:29:20.
I don't have many people/friends in my life that are runners or understand the concept of running lol

My previous PR was 1:37 from last year, however I did not really own up to that because I did take a 30 second break during that run. 

At the start of this year I focused more on doing speed work during my training and really forced myself to run slower during my recovery/long runs. I realized in March that I was really able to pick up the pace and hold onto it for longer distances than I would've imagined. I was setting all these new PRs and even recently completed my goal of the year by running a sub 6 minute mile - Clocked in my mile at 5:44. 

I decided this last weekend was good enough to try and break 1:35:00 for my new half PR, but once I hit the road I just felt light, strong and focused. I kept track of my pace and knew my route well enough to know when I would be hitting hills to prepare myself for any sort of slowdown in my pace.

By mile 10 I realized a sub 90 minute pace was possible, but that final push was a bit tougher than I would've liked. 
Question now is how in the world can I keep that pace up to go a full 26.2? 

I never would've imagined I could run a half at a Boston Qualifier pace, but now I'm wondering how far I can really push myself.

Thanks to /u/prairiefirephoenix for the suggestion.

*History*

&gt; Technically, it’s not “Pre’s” workout. It was developed by his coach Bill Bowerman and became part of the “Oregon System” used by a generation of superstars. But Pre’s name is the one that will be forever associated with it.


*What* 

As run by Pre:

&gt; It was simple, wicked, and fast: alternating 200s at 30 seconds, then at 40 seconds, either for a set distance, such as three miles, or until he could no longer hold pace. 

&gt;Pre reportedly sustained this for 4.5 miles, a record that stood for years. Galen Rupp carried it to 6 miles.

For mortals:

&gt; The fast 200s should be slightly slower than your mile pace, and the “slow” ones shouldn’t be a mere 10 seconds slower, but 33 1/3 percent slower. Thus, for a 6:00-miler running the fast segments at 45 or 46 seconds, the slower ones are all the way down to 60 or 61 seconds. 

*How*

&gt; The first time you try this, don’t worry too much about the distance. The goal is to find the rhythm. You can set a target distance if you want to, dividing it into sets, if need be, with a longer recovery between them, e.g., 2 sets of 6 reps, adding up to 3 miles.

AdvancedRunning,KMoe97,How Many Marathons Should I Run Before My First Marathon Event,"Hello.

I plan to run my first marathon race on October 16th. I would like to know how many marathons I should incorporate into my training to prepare for the race.

Due to a recent surgery, I cannot start training until July 1st. I wont specify the surgery, but it won't affect my running ability. That gives me 15 weeks of training. Prior to surgery I was running around 15 mi/week at around a 7min/mi pace.

I plan to start with just 10-15 easy jogging miles/week and eventually build up to 40-50/week by September. Currently, I think a half marathon (timed test) in the middle of August, and 2 marathon preps in September (easy, ""dip your toes in"" for the start of September, and a timed trial near the end of September) is how I will play it out.

To clarify, I ran Cross Country in High School and am 23 now. I am used to running long distances, and am happy to challenge myself to attempt my first marathon. My target time is 3:29:00 with an 8min/mi pace, but will be satisfied with any finish under 4:00:00",1622640801
AdvancedRunning,LaTortugaloco,"Fixing hip drop by measuring it, anyone got advice/tips?","Hi Advanced runners,

TL;DR: I have a persistent hip-drop on my left side when running 'easy' (read: slow) that I can't seem to fix by strengthening. It is most persistent when running my slower paces (5:00-6:00 min/km). This hip drop is assumed to be the cause of my runners-knee on the left side. Tips/advice needed!

Photo comparing the left and right side stance phase for illustration: [https://imgur.com/a/XwqGx4n](https://imgur.com/a/XwqGx4n) (sorry for bad quality, took the photos from my pysio's ipad.)

**Backstory:**

Since January I have been struggling with a mild runners-knee. It sometimes also hurts when going downstairs or when I have to hop on/off the sidewalk. Normally pain goes away after 2-3 days of no big loads on the knee (meaning no long runs/cycling) and going downstairs is pain-free again. 

So naturally I decided to visit a fysio, after the regular exercises didn't do much (kept the RN under control, but didn't eliminate the pain). Here he analysed my running form at the 6:00''/km pace and came to the conclusion that I have a persistent hip-drop on my left side. This causes my left foot to turn inwards (to the right), and my hip to drop, turn slightly forward and to the left when seen from above. The result is me twisting the 'ends' of my legs ever so slightly against each other, hurting my left knee. At least, this is the hypothesis we have right now. The cause is assumed to be weak glutes and a weaker right back muscle. 

Then me and my fysio started to think, when did this problem first occur? And why didn't it happen before? Because I was already running steadily around the 20-30k a week for a year then. Eureka! It was when I was upping my mileage and in turn **doing more 'slow' runs.** Thinking back I realised my knee hurt the most when I was taking it easy, and the least during tempo intervals. We checked my hip drop again at a much higher pace (4:00''/km) and it was barely visible anymore. This leads us to believe my technique dramatically worsens as I start to run slower. 

However, I have been trying to fix this with exercises over the last few months, but to no avail. It really seems that it is more of a 'control' issue of the muscles when running, instead of a strength issue. My reasoning for thinking this is that I have quite good (single) leg strength already, and all more advanced stability exercises I can perform with relative ease. However, when I go running my left glute simply goes 'ah, you don't need me here, clearly your hip and knee joint can do the work, imma chill' right from the start. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I would like your help with:**

\- Have you experienced something similar? If so, how did you fix it? Just run fast? But how to do base building then?

AdvancedRunning,RunningFromPhD,Using Vo2 to determine potential,"Hi all,

I have been curious for awhile about Vo2 max and it’s ability to predict the potential of an individual.

I’m not trying to get into the details of Vo2 training or using it as a value to determine training intensity, but using the actual maximum value (absolute or relative) as a means for determining someone's potential. I haven’t been very successful in my literature search, hopefully someone has come across something like this?

I recently found the printout I received a few years back in undergrad when I did a Vo2 max test for one of our physiology professors studies. I guess I can't upload images, but these are the peak readings before failure. I never really asked about interpreting these, I'm really only aware that it's high, but there's not a lot of information out there.

AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Jack Daniels 5-week cycle marathon training - concerns and workout scheduling questions,"Hey, I am starting to get ready for the Philly marathon in November and want to base my training on the JD 5 week cycle template. It's a repeatable template for scheduling workouts, you pick the workouts and mileage yourself. The schedule looks like this:

|Sun|Mon|Tues|Wed|Thurs|Fri|Sat|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Long|Easy|Easy|Threshold|Speed|Easy|Easy|

Weeks 2+4 have marathon workout long runs. The speed workouts are mile or 5k pace.

1. What's up with the back to back workouts? I saw this in his short distance plans but was surprised to see it in a marathon plan. Im guessing the second workout is low priority and should be easy, but do many people have success training like that for the marathon? I dont have any experience with back to back workouts.
2. JD advises against changing around the order of workouts in a similar template (""alien"" training for 15k-30k), but how bad is that really? I find that I recover from speedwork a lot faster than tempos and long runs, how can I use that to schedule these workouts?  The annoying thing is I'd prefer to keep the long run on sunday and not to do a long session on wednesday. Is there be a problem with (L, E, S, E, T, E, E)?
3. Has anyone followed this template or a similar one for marathon training around 50-60mpw with success? Can't find much info about the 5 week cycle out there.",1622576443
AdvancedRunning,RyanJS0901,Question about returning from injury,"I was running once or twice a week over the last year, but decided to get more serious over the past few months. I went from running probably 5-6 miles a week to 15-20 pretty quickly. Ended up with some sort of calf strain (I think) that has sidelined me and caused me to back out of my first 10k.

AdvancedRunning,Pifflin,College runner looking to lose weight for Fall,"Hi everyone, a shitty cocktail of depression, poor diet, and injury from a previous season has led me to balloon up to my current weight of 200 lbs. I dont own a scale, so when I was weighed at the doctor's I was shocked. I knew a gained a bit of a belly but I didn't realize it was that much weight.

For background, I'm 6'0 and usually raced at 150-160 lbs, but always felt better around 150. Ive got 13 weeks to lose at least a good portion of this weight, as I've slowed dramatically and don't want to be cut from my team.

I am training for a marathon in the fall. I would appreciate hearing people's thoughts on wearing these for a marathon. Google seems to suggest maybe only up to half marathon, so I am wondering if these old legs might get too beat up.

FYI, I am definitely not shelling out the $$$ needed for the truly top-quality marathon shoes, except maybe if I believe they could make the difference between a BQ and not.

AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Is this goal too ambitious?,"I’ve raced the mile three times this season, and I have improved by ~10 sec every meet, starting at 6:07 and now am down to 5:46. I’m figuring that my luck of improving by 10 sec is starting to run out but I’m optimistic that I’ll run in the 5:40s again at my upcoming meet (in my most recent race I had a pack to run with which helped me PR). 

I’ve been liking the strategy of aiming for even splits (85-86) because last time I was able to pick it up at the 1000. 

My goal would really be to go sub 5:40 which is crazy because my season goal was just sub 6. It sounds easy - just 85 sec per lap, but I know it won’t be easy for me at all because last race I was hurting down the last 200...

Any advice about pacing strategies? Some people tend to go out in 80 and I just don’t know if I can hold that pace (not to mention it’s getting dangerous close to my 400 PR!). 

In workouts I do 400 repeats (x8) anywhere from 78 - 86. I’m not running as much mileage as I’d like (~30). I thought I was better at longer distances like the 5k and 10k but I don’t even know if these times indicate anything: 21:05, 45:30. 

Just wondering if 5:40 is achievable (forgot to mention I’m a girl). Also will take any tips about pacing and racing in general - thank you!",1622559543
AdvancedRunning,danops,DIY 50km across Rhode Island,"On May 15th, I ran from the Massachusetts border through Rhode Island to the Connecticut border.  

* Date: May 15th, 2021
* Distance: 31.1 miles intended, 31.3 miles Strava route, 31.5 actual
* Location: Rhode Island
* Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/5302190318](https://www.strava.com/activities/5302190318)
* Time: 6:17:43

**Background:**

I started running to lose weight during high school and began running for fun in undergrad.  In 2017 I ran my first marathon and in 2019 I ran my first ultra.  I got the idea to run across Rhode Island when I was there for a summer job in 2019.  This was after my first ultra (50 miler) and right before my first 50km, so I though I would be ready for another ultra the next summer when I was back for work again.  Covid canceled that in 2020 and 2021, but I was tired of waiting so I decided to road trip and do it anyway.  A few people said they might come to help but couldn’t in the end.

**Training:**

Nothing special on the training end.  My ultramarathon strategy was to walk any steep uphills and to run at least the first 20 miles of flats/downhills.  After that I could adjust a run-walk strategy based on how I was feeling.  I planned to walk every time I ate or drank.  In my training, I usually ran four times per week: short, medium, short, long.  The long run maxed out at 18 miles, which in retrospect was too short.  

I absolutely hate carrying stuff during my runs so every time I needed water or food, I stopped at my parked car.  This limited the variety of training runs I could get in.  I live in a very flat area; the amount of elevation gain on the ultra was equivalent to an entire month of my training runs.  Miles per week was very consistent; every week since November was in the 30-36 range.  Again, too short in retrospect.  My MPW had been higher for my previous two ultramarathons.  I’d like to blame the pandemic, but it was mostly laziness and overconfidence.

**The Route:**

When I visited Rhode Island, I never set foot in any of the areas I ran.  My planning was through Google Maps and a post I made on the Rhode Island subreddit.

Miles 0 – 7.1: The run started in Seekonk, Massachusetts.  This was picked for convenience since I could get an Airbnb a two mile walk away.  The route went through Providence by Brown University then through Cranston.  

Miles: 7.1 – 26.0: This section was on the Washington Secondary Rail Trail; a paved greenway beginning in Cranston and ending in Coventry.  A nicely kept trail with a minimal number of road crossings.

Miles 26.0 – 28.8: At this point, the paved section gives way to a dirt trail that has been under construction for several years.  Actually “gives way” is not correct, because the paved road just ends.  You need to walk through a dead-end road with several “no trespassing” sign equipped houses to find the dirt trail.  This is something I checked out on my way to the Airbnb to know if it was even possible to get through.  The trail gets extremely rough in some parts, with huge mud puddles and downed trees.  Running is nearly impossible.

Miles 28.8 – 31.3: The trail becomes the Trestle Trail and gets much nicer, although still unpaved.  The route crosses the border into Oneco, Connecticut.  

**Race Day:**

The morning was very chilly for mid-May (or maybe that’s just how Rhode Island is).  I bought a new backpack for this race which I had never tried before.  I loaded it up with five bottles of water and ~2600 calories of food.  I chose bottles of water instead of a water bladder, because the bottles of water were more volume than the 2 liter bladder that was included.  For food, I brought an assortment of: Welches, Nature Valley XL, Clif Shot Bloks, Clif Bars, and Honey Stingers.  I felt like I had more than enough supplies for a chilly spring day.  It would warm up a bit by the end, but by the point I would be able to power through without any nutrition drops or help. I walked the two miles to the MA side of the border and began.

**The Race:**

There was very little traffic in the city sections so I could run in the street as needed.  Not testing out the backpack was one of my biggest issues.  I didn’t realize until around 12 miles in that it was poorly adjusted; it chaffed a horrible blister into the skin around my collarbone.  I was able to adjust it, but the damage was done.  Taking showers was a painful experience for the next two weeks.

Also, the backpack was just too heavy.  The heaviest thing I had carried during my last year of training was my running watch.  I’ve had to use backpacks for marathons before, but I always traveled light and refueled at aid stations.  I regret not strong arming one of my friends to come along, or at least dropping some supplies somewhere.

At mile 3 I got a great look at Providence River.  After that, I ran the length of Brown University.  The first highlight was the last bit of the city section.  Around mile 6.5, I ran through a rough neighborhood.  I never felt in danger, but at one point a homeless man started yelling at me and pumping his fist.  Not the sort of thing I wanted to encounter but it gave the run some flavor.

The paved greenway section was a nice change of pace.  The city had been flat, but from mile 13 to 25 the greenway was one gentle uphill.  At some point a cyclist told me he saw a coyote; I never saw it.  My plan was to run the first 20 miles at least and up until mile 16 I was doing great.

My nutrition plan was to eat and drink every 4 miles on the dot.  While I was doing this, I would walk.  This had been successful until mile 16.  I felt like I had a lot more running in me, but at mile 16 I unexpectedly switched to run-walk.  The chaffed area of my collarbone was one fire and burned whenever sweat touched it.  My backpack was now much lighter, but I still hated it.  And the weather shifted 20 degrees in the 2.5 hours since I started.  I began to walk a mile, run a mile.  

Honestly, I was kind of depressed and moving into death march territory.  I really started getting into my head at this point, even running for a mile was difficult.  I know it was all mental because I had a lot of juice left in me and I had run much farther for my marathon completions, but another disaster hit at mile 25: I ran completely out of water.  How could I run out of water? I had 85 ounces and the temperature was 59 at the beginning.  I really felt like an amateur.  I completed 5 marathons and 2 ultras before this, do I owe all my finishes to the aid stations babysitting me?

At this point I got out my phone to tell my group chat I was giving up.  Without water I could not finish.  I knew that the dirt section began at mile 26 and there was a road there.  I could get to 26, walk an extra .2 to make it a marathon, then uber back.  My groupchat responded that I was a coward, go buy water somewhere and keep going.  My response: how can I buy water on a greenway?  Enough for me to walk through the bad trail portion which would take at least an hour on its own?

The answer to that, my friends, is the [Summit General Store](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Summit+General+Store/@41.6922762,-71.6882975,15.96z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x7f716ee637529566!8m2!3d41.6911597!4d-71.6989134).  Where the paved greenway ends and the dirt trail begins is a convenience store.  I wouldn’t even need to walk on the road because it was next to the greenway.  I saw this on my phone around mile 25.5 and my redemption was planned.  I ran to mile 26, circled around the convenience store to make it 26.2 in case I decided to quit after all, and purchased a Gatorade and two water bottles.   

After the store I began the 2 mile trek through the really bad trail section.  My second wind had come and I began running after I cleared the section.  Finishing after this was a breeze, walking just to eat/drink.  

**Post-race:**

I set out to do a 50km, but after the convenience store circling it ended up 31.5 miles.  The real prize was going from border to border.  It was kind of a miserable and yet fun experience.  After I finished in Connecticut, I took an hour long uber back to my Airbnb which was almost as expensive as my Airbnb was.  I think I’m going to do another border to border next summer (but no more solo).  Some candidates are DC, Delaware, and New Hampshire.  If you’re interested in crossing Rhode Island like this, I would recommend it.",1622556597

From start of April I decided to train for a Marathon with 2 major goals:
1. Get in the habbit of consistent running, because I know that I love the sport and want to do it consistently.
2. Lose some additional weight before I take on a more difficult training block.

I had another side goal of completing the marathon in under 5 hrs.

With these goals in mind most of my efforts were easy/moderate effort training at around 6:50 min/km pace.

Previous 5k time trial effort was 28:30 approximately

Yesterday I decided to run my 5K easy run as a 5K time trial, because I hadn't done one in a long time and after morning storm the heat was less.

I had a 1 km warmup, and then ran a 5k effort.
My time was 26:27, though my main goal was to hit below 28 and at the beginning I thought sub 27 minutes almost impossible for me at my current level.

My splits:

1k 5:24
2k 5:31
3k 5:16
4k 5:11
5k 5:06

This made me question how I perceived my ability,.
Looking for inputs about what I did right and what should I continue to do.

AdvancedRunning,matchop,"Keep putting on weight, despite training. Using calf too much for running, thoughts?","I have been running for about 7 years now. I have trained and run anything in between half marathon to 100 miler. I have once BQ’ed in early 2019. Since then, I have hit a slump, a long term slump.

I am in my late 30s.

I have tried a few rounds of build ups during 2020 and nothing seem to work. I learned that through few rounds of that build up, I screwed up a few golden rules of training, like have 1wk of down week every 3-4 weeks or so. Listen to the body etc. I am trying to rebuild smarter now.

I am now adding 1-2 strength sessions per week of step ups with weight - to activate hamstring-glutes kinetic chain. I am going back to focusing on 80-20, one to two HIIT sessions per week, anywhere between 5x3mins to something equivalent on stationary bike (Zwift). I have found this to be massively helpful in my build up, Garmin has stopped saying “unproductive.”

I am also following a rule that every run workout, I will follow by a bike recovery (massive help) instead of recovery run. I am now only running 3-4 times a week, adding 1 short + 1 slightly longer ride per week (2-2.5hr ride). I tend to be able to follow recovery run pace very well even before this build up, however I cant seem to recover my calfs to sustain 5-6 days of running. I cant remember having any problems with hamstring, or quads, I always have calf problems - specifically slightly above achilles tendon and below gastrocs. 

That led me to this question, I have seen enough to know that this is not that normal that some other runners seems to not have “calf issues” where they would complain about hamstring, or quads somethings (for which I cant understand, as I never have those problems). My forte is running downhill and even that, I hardly ever blown my quads.

I am trying to rebuild speed as this pandemic has robbed me of about 8 Vo2Max points (according to Garmin). Put aside if you believe them to be accurate or not, studies say they are relatively accurate but what’s important here is, the relative difference in fitness. I have since also put on about 22lbs for which I cant seem to find a way to shake out.

Sure, not accounting for weight, perhaps if I was back to my racing form, simple calculation would’ve put me at around 56 Vo2Max vs 51 now as Garmin says.

I am sorry, I know it is a lot, but I am at lost to what to do. I will take any advice. Thanks so much in advance.",1622502637
AdvancedRunning,run_INXS,Bolder on the Run 10K Race Report,"This is probably my first race report on AR since 'the return' so 4-5 years, partly because as an aging runner, not on the upward swing--PRs were a long long time ago (last PR set in 1991). Nevertheless, I still enjoy running and racing. 

**Background**

Been running almost forever, got excited about it in 1976 watching the Olympic buildup (including some meets like the Big 10 championships and Drake Relays in person, and trials/Olympic Games on TV). I started running some a the same time, and decided to give college running a try as a jog on (the coach saw me jogging around campus in the first week and recruited me to xc and track). After that I never really stopped, other than having some years sidelined by injuries (mostly late 30s and mid-40s). At this point I have been a masters runner longer than open. A long time. 

**Training**

Training for a marathon next month (Grandmas). I don't do marathons all the time, on average about one every three years (first one was in 1983), and mostly focus on road racing or cross country, and did some trail racing until about 5 years ago, but have set that aside due to wonky ankles and propensity to trip and fall. 

The build up has gone fairly well, and mixed in a fair amount of xc skiing over the winter (about 15% or 20% of training volume), with a weekly long session culminating with 43K in about 3 hr at the end of February. And added indoor cycling as a supplement, about 2-4 times a week since Feb, usually short sessions of 20-30 minutes--instead of doing running doubles.

This training block has been mostly been good, with 50 mpw in Feb/March in addition to the cycling and skiing, 60 mpw for April, and 70 mpw in May (but cutting back to just 1 cycling session a week). I have been doing weekly tempos and workouts (longer reps from 600 m to 1500 m, ranging from 5K to 10K pace). 

Tune up racing has been mixed. Started out with a 1/2 marathon last month in Loveland (elev. 5000 feet) in 1:25, and was really encouraged with that. However in the weeks after was somewhat disappointed to run 3K in 11:09 and 5K in 19:07. Tired legs and not a lot of spring--even though I was wearing supershoes (dragonflies). My theory is maybe you need to be well under 6:00/mile pace to get the benefit of those shoes. 

**Bolder on the Run**

This is the socially distanced version of the Bolder Boulder 10K. Usually you have 50,000 runners line up on 30th street and finish in Folsom Stadium. Last year they went virtual and I ran solo, this year they tried a socially distanced operation, with six sites and multiple start windows per site over a period of three days. 

 [Bolder On The Run Race Week Home - BOLDERBoulder 10K](https://bb10k.bolderboulder.com/) 

About a dozen of my club mates decided to run together in Firestone, CO (just east of Longmont/NE of Boulder about 20 or 25 miles). After scouting out the courses they decided this might be the fastest. Course was an out and back on a bike path, starting at 4,900'. In Colorado that's considered low elevation. 

**Race Day and Race**

We got the weather just right. At 7 AM on Saturday it was about 55 degrees, and just a slight breeze from the north. I think there were 12 of us lined up--very different from the noise and hoopla of a typical Bolder Boulder, with trumpets starting each wave of 500, and that goes on all morning. We had six or seven 50-54 year olds, a couple kids (boy and girl, age 14 and 12: very fast!), and two of us over 60. It was a good group, and we kind of ended up dominating our respective age divisions. 

I ran with Mark, who is a couple years younger, and known as a mountain runner (has won Pikes Peak Ascent age group several times). Most took off at 6:00 pace, Mark and I ran at 6:19. We caught a couple of them at by 2 miles 12:22. I had planned to run under 6:20 pace for the first couple of miles and then do 6:15 or under. But we were both breathing pretty hard so I just kept the same effort. By the end of the third mile (quarter mile before the turn around) the pace seemed too fast so I eased up and Mark pulled away easily. I hit the 5K turn around in about 19:50 or just under). 

The return was moderately tough going, but sub 40 was do or die. Only a handful or so of 60+ runners have ever gone under 40 for this event: I did it two years ago, and last year in the virtual race. If I could do it this year, when it is official, I would be come the 2nd oldest to match that. I knew sub 39 was not in the cards for this day, and Mark was rocketing away (he would run almost a 1 minute negative split!) and passing the other runners, my goal was not to ease up. My return splits were 6:24, 6:28, and was really worried that I would blow up over a long but slightly graded hill (1-2%) just before the final turn. So had to dig some there: 6:20 and then kicked in for the final few hundred meters at 6:00 pace to finish in 39:33. Phew! Made it. 

**Aftermath and Dissection**

It was a good showing for our club, as the 50+ guys ran in the 36s-38s. And those kids! The boy (heading into high school next year at one of the best programs in the state) ran 37 and the young girl ran under 39! I think she will probably have the highest age grade. 

We met at a nearby restaurant for a chilly outdoor meal/good food. Nice to get to socialize more this month as covid transmission is down and vaccinations are up. 

I'm a little disappointed not to have gone faster (old and tired legs). Back in the day, and even as recently as just a couple years ago, I could train hard or moderately hard and could get to a good level. Over the past year and a half, I have worked at it, but have not been back in that groove where it all clicks.

However, here are the good things. Mark and I were way ahead of anyone else in our age division, in fact faster than anyone over 52. I broke 40, and it will be official (maybe with an astrisk because this course was 400 feet lower than the actual Bolder Boulder and there were fewer hills. That aside, and several of us spent some time talking about this on Saturday, we are healthy and enjoying the sport. 

On to the marathon. And hopefully line up for the real Bolder Boulder next year.",1622502389
AdvancedRunning,lukie4242,Would this be useful for runners? Software idea,"I have an idea for some software that I think could be useful for runners. However, given I am the only long-distance runner that I know its hard for me to find validation for this idea so I have turned here for feedback. **Please be honest, critical, and direct.**

In short my idea is some sort of software (accessible to users through either a native phone app or website) which would allow for a runner to train for a race locally. Let me give you a use case example.

Let's say you live in Houston, Texas and you are planning to run the Boston Marathon this year. You've heard about the challenging hills of the Boston Marathon but you have never ran the course so it causes you a little bit of worry. During your training, you want to get a ""near"" simulation of the Boston Marathon course. You pull out your phone, open the app, and it will map a path close to you (perhaps starting and ending at your front door) that nearly resembles what you will run in Boston.

By nearly resembles I mean a few things

1. It will match the elevation profile of the Boston Marathon course
2. It will match turns within the Boston Marathon course

Therefore, you would be able to easily plug this course path into whatever routing application that you use. FYI it would not be limited to just the Boston Marathon, you could match the course of any popular race of any distance. I hope this makes sense, if there is any uncertainty please comment below.

Would this be useful? Does this already exist? Any ideas or comments?

Thank you all for taking the time to read this and good luck on all future races!",1622499400
AdvancedRunning,nicogno_,Post 10k - Pre Marathon,"Hi everyone, I’ve been running for a few years based only on my feelings, than in February I signed up for a 10k race to be held on May 30 and in March I started following a training plan for the first time. I read Pfitzinger’s ARR and picked up his 10k plan of 12 weeks with a peak @ 42 mpw. I completed every workout that was scheduled and increased the length of the endurance runs and general aerobic runs by a few miles, reaching 46 mpw.
Due to the pandemic restrictions the race was moved to the virtual format and thus yesterday I run the 10k alone close to where I live, improving my last PB (38’20”) and going below 37’, which is a result I didn’t expect to achieve (the actual time was 36’37”). 
And now the questions: Last year I signed up for the 2020 NYC marathon and I hope I will run it this year (on November 7th). Given that my goal is to complete it in less than 3 hours
- when should I start training specifically for that race?
- if the answer to the previous question isn’t “tomorrow”/“today”/“yesterday”, should I use the time before the specific training to build additional mileage, or can I keep training for other shorter races?
- if so, what’s the best way to maintain the developed fitness?

Thank you!",1622497232
AdvancedRunning,_Vexation_,Mileage for summer base phase (5k training),"Hi guys, What would be good mileage for a make going into junior year of cross country? Last year I was at 45 sometimes 50 miles per week all summer and dropped it down to 35-40 for the season. Would 60-65 miles per week (10 miles a day a 15 mile long run and a rest day so running 6 days a week) this summer be a good idea with maybe a week or two hitting 70? If it helps my PRs are currently (rounded for anonymity) 5k: 17:2x, mile: 4:5x, 800: 2:0x high, 400: 57.xx. Hoping to hit sub 16:30 if at all possible for XC.

I ran indoor and outdoor track, so all year round training with the exception with a few weeks. I really never trained that hard, only really later in the season when I trained with the upperclassmen. No real track of miles per week, and wasn’t running with the right people. This year, I really want to step up my training and work ethic, because I know what I need to do now. With my goal of 17:30 what would be a good average of miles per week?

I don't really post on Reddit very often, but as a serial lurker who's enjoyed reading a bunch of awesome Race Reports and learning a lot from /r/AdvancedRunning I've been looking forward to posting this for a few months now!

### Background
I picked up running in the spring of 2020 for the first time as an ""actual sport."" I rowed competitively through my teens and into my twenties, so running was usually reserved for bad-weather cross-training. I've always enjoyed running, but prior to about a year ago, had never run consecutively further than about 12 km. I had no inclination to change that either.

*Cue a global pandemic*

Like a lot of people, I spent the early days of the first lockdown sitting on my couch doom-scrolling and losing whatever baseline fitness I thought I had. In May of last year, I laced up some old Nike trainers, and headed out the door for the first time in wayyy too long. Over the next few weeks I saw some fairly quick adaptation gains, started to feel like this was something I wanted to stick with, and ended up buying my first Garmin, and a pair of Pegasus 37s. I was immediately drawn to the Garmin Coach app, because although I have a background in endurance sports, as well as exercise physiology, building a training plan specific to running was new to me. I started working through the cookie-cutter 5K plan and started to see some progress.  

In a bit of a fluke, I was down an Instagram rabbit hole, and came across a local running club last September, and saw that they were holding a ""Just for fun Half Marathon"" with a pandemic-friendly cap of ~25 people. Coincidentally, my 5K plan had me running 18 km long runs at that time, so I thought, ""Hell, what's another 3 km."" I ran that ""race"" in November of last year ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/4448826002)) in 1:42:45, and thought at the end, ""That wasn't so bad, maybe I should run a Marathon some day?""

Fast forward through a bunch of lame times that I won't bore you kind internet strangers with, I spent the winter running 99% easy runs, building to 50-60 km/week, and started to get bored. I wanted something to work towards, but unfortunately, we're still a ways away from having any organized racing here in Ontario. I decided that as far as time trials go, a Half seemed like the perfect distance for me. I wouldn't have to suffer through the lactic hell of a 5K solo, but I also wouldn't have to self-motivate myself through the grind of a full Marathon... Plus, I want my first to be with other people.

I was all set to start my new target training plan, right up until I slipped on some ice on a trail run, went down hard, and gave myself a sweet hematoma on my left glute. It was about a week before I could even walk briskly without my deep hip rotators going into spasm, and two weeks before I was able to tolerate any sort of running.

### Training
I re-built mileage over the second half of January, and February, and started another Garmin Coach training plan at the beginning of March. Based on feeling like I had a lot more in the tank after that first Half in November, as well as feeling some increased fitness relating to building mileage over the winter, and sticking some workout-based PRs into the VDOT calculator, I figured that 1:30:00 would be an ambitious, but doable goal for me. Annoyingly, the app capped (caps?) the most ambitious goal that I could set at 1:32:00... oh well.

In the first few weeks of the plan, I felt a bit in over my head, but was able to handle most of the workouts. The plan had me running 5-6 days/week, typically with 1-2 quality workouts per week, and gradually increasing long runs that culminated in 2 hours in duration ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/5225554446)). Throughout the program, there were also goal pace runs that I found pretty helpful as a measuring stick of how my fitness was coming along through the process. From the first goal pace run that I bailed on after only 18/30 minutes at the slow end of the prescribed paces ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/4959285467)), to the final goal pace workout where I comfortably surpassed the top end of the bracket, I felt a huge fitness and confidence increase ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/4959285467)). Overall, throughout the plan, I only missed two runs, both easy runs, and definitely supplemented them in other weeks when I had more time on my hands. 

### Pre-race
I was a little anxious regarding the taper in this plan, as my last long run was on May 8, and there were only two quality workouts in the final 2 weeks of the plan. In addition to that, in the final quality workout, a 30 minute tempo run, I bailed out after 8 minutes due to humidity and just feeling awful overall. I was able to talk myself off the ledge and convince myself that my fitness was where it needed to be and that everything was going to be alright on race day.

The night before the race I ate... A lot... The final tally was 2 burgers, a sausage, and a plate full of potato salad/chickpea salad... Washed down with a beer... And pecan pie for dessert. I did manage to do a good job of hydrating the week prior to the race (not my strongest suit), and especially the day before, and I got a great sleep the night before.

The morning of the race I snoozed my alarm a couple of times when it went off at 7:00 and 7:05, had a couple cups of coffee, and a bagel with peanut butter. I spent about an hour hanging out and taking care of morning stuff, then got ready to warm up.

As a warm up I ran ~5' at 5:30/km pace, ~3' at 5:00/km pace, ~2' at 4:30 pace. I then did 5 ~75 m strides at what felt like a little bit faster than race pace, then jogged back home. I ate a Gu 5 minutes before heading off, and laced up.

### Race
I was super lucky to have two friends help me out with this race, my pal Mat rode along with me on his bike, serving as my pack-mule and cheerleader. My buddy DJ met us at the 10 km mark to help with wind breaking and pacing/motivation for the second half.

I chose the route for this race based mostly on convenience, leaving from the closest intersection to my house, and following the routes I run literally all the time (seriously, it's a problem, you'll see if you check out my Strava history). The course was pretty pancake flat (although a net 16m downhill). With that in mind, I figured I'd be cheating myself if I didn't include at least one decent climb (still only 20 m of climb at a 2.6% grade).

We set off at 9:30 am, and the first few kms clicked by pretty much as well as I could have asked for. I was a little bit ahead of my target pace, but it felt totally comfortable and sustainable. Around the 5 km mark I took my first drink from Mat and told him things were feeling really strong. The 8th km was the one that had the one climb mentioned above, and given that I was feeling as well as I was, I attacked the first half of the hill before lifting off a bit when it felt like the effort was getting to be a bit taxing. Kms 9 and 10 were equally unremarkable, and by the time we met up with DJ at the 10K point, we had a 1 minute cushion ahead of where my goal pace would have put us.

Seeing DJ was a good mental boost as well, as although there were still 11.1 km remaining, that felt like the natural half-way point. I took another drink at 10, ate a Gu at 11 (real convenient having trash cans on campus), and washed that down with another small sip. As we started to retrace our steps through the student ghetto we started to hit a bit of a headwind and for the first time I started to feel the effort. I could feel my breathing start to get a little bit more laboured, and didn't feel like I was in the same groove I'd been in before fueling and drinking a couple of times. I tried to focus from km 11-14 on getting back on track and seemed to get myself sorted just in time to hit the downhill equivalent of the same hill I faced at km 8.

We took full advantage of the long-ish gradual downhill in km 15 and picked up speed while relaxing effort a bit, and by the bottom of the hill, it felt like we were basically home... We weren't. As we came under the bridges in the 17th km, we hit a gusty headwind off of the harbour, which stuck around as a quartering headwind. I also had some bad luck with some bad mental math, and thought that we were approaching the lap marker for lap 19, when it was actually only lap 18. At that point of the race, 3 km felt a whole lot longer than 2! I spent most of the time from 17-20 just trying to focus on being smooth, and maintaining the same pace. Just before the 19 km mark we passed my wife and some friends arriving at the park to celebrate at the finish, and although it was a really nice mental boost, I didn't feel like I had anything left in the tank.

Apparently, I did still have a little bit left in the tank, as I was able to close the last 1.1 km in my fastest split of the whole affair. Can't say I wasn't thrilled to hear Mat yell ""Time!"" from behind me, stop my watch, and double over with my hands on my knees!

### Post-race
We met up with my wife and a few friends in the park. She brought the best damn donuts in the city and a couple of beers for the guys who helped me out! We hung out for about an hour in the sunshine, and I've been stapled to the couch for most of the afternoon. I'm still really early in my running journey and super motivated to keep improving. I've been reading a lot of stuff on here, as well as Pfitzinger's Advanced Marathoning, and am working on Daniels' Running Formula. I've also enjoyed listening to a lot of the back catalogue of the Running Rogue podcast, and hope to keep picking things up as I go along!

Overall, I'd say that the Garmin plan worked pretty well for me, I hit my goal and then some. I'm hoping that I will be able to get my first Marathon in this fall. I'm planning to spend the next couple of weeks rebuilding mileage that's come off since the taper, and then likely going to tackle the Pfitz 18/55 plan!

This quickly became a full blown novel, so if you stuck with me all the way to here, thanks! Thanks also to everyone who posts such great content on this sub, I've learned a lot and taken a lot of motivation from reading what others are doing out there!

AdvancedRunning,Bjarnemann,OK generalist running plan? + some bonus questions,"Hi!

* 29 years.
* Avarage mileage: 70.
* Peak mileage: 74 (carefully upping mileage).
* 10k: 39:14.
* 5k: 19:07 (a bit old).

One simple question: is this a ok running plan for 5k, 10k and maybe a HM? Are the principles right?

**Principles:**

* Two quality sessions/week.
   * Typically one 6\*4 mins. Vo2/near Vo2 - atleast quite well above LT.
   * One tempo effort. 20-40 min continous, or X\*X mins at \~LT effort.
   * If I'm feeling beat up, I'll ditch the intervalls in favour of one more tempo effort. 
* One long run/week.
* Slowly, *slowly* upping mileage from 70k/week. Two reasons for *slowly*:
   * I also have three 80 min sessions with strength training (equally prioritzed as running). Training takes a lot of time!
   * To be completely sure that I'll avoid injury. Crapped my knee in november, don't wanna do that again. Time + injury prevention = it's enough with a slowly upping. I have no ambitions of running 100k/week in the near future. 
* Three weks up, one down (70% of mileage, only easy running, maybe a lilght quality).
   * To prevent injury, but also to keep myself feeling fresh. I've gotten good keeping easy easy, but I'm not that good keeping juice in the tank om quality sessions.

**The week:** 

* Monday: 
   * Full rest/easy, *easy* recovery. Max 20 min
* Tuesday: 
   * Strenght training, including quite hard DLs and moderate squats.
   * 6\*4 mins. Tempo instead, if feeling beat up. \~80-90 min. Typically 13-17k. 
* Wednesday:
   * \~60 min easy. Typically 10-12k.
* Thursday:
   * Active recovery. 20-30 min. Typically 4-6k.
* Friday:
   * Strength training, including quite hard sqauts, and moderate DLs.
   * Tempo effort. \~70-80 min. Typically 13-15k.
* Saturday:
   * Long run. \~120 min. Typically 20-25k. Usually easy, sometimes strong finish, some times zone 3.
* Sunday:
   * Strenght training. No legs, only upper body.
   * 40-60 min easy. Usually 7-10k. 

Does this routine and principles have some OBVIOUS flaws? I cannot change the order of workouts day too much, without it crashing with my job schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus questions:** 

* I've heard that quality running should be atleast 16 min ""in zone"". Preferably 20 min+. I therefore never run 3k as a time trial. A shame, cuzz it would be nice to get a PR there too. Is it true, that the effort is kinda wasted if you don't tip 16 min?
* Polarized training and 80/20 is one principle I've learned. I also learned that it's smart to cap quality at top 40 min. A shame, because it's would also fun to run 90 min in zone 3\*, run a 85% effort for 60 min, or just to see how far I could get in 60 min. Is this only stupid, and that ineffecient training as I've come to learn? High restitution demands, not that great of an adaption.
   * \*Is zone 3 really that ugly as rumors want it?

AdvancedRunning,NBeeLange,Race after time off for Injury?,"A few months ago I started dealing with some minor shin pain. I’d been running for about a year at this point and this was the first time I felt this. I continued running through it for a few weeks even though the pain started seeming more consistent. Finally, about a month and a half after the first arrival of pain, I hit a point where it was just too painful to run. I decided to take time off right then and there.

That was 15 days ago. As of today I’m finally having my first zero pain day in my right shin. I was able to jog from my car to the front door without any pain at all (minor victory). 

Earlier this year I signed up for a race I was super excited for. It’s a 14 mile trail race with 4000ft elevation gain. This was definitely a big highlight for me, and I was training hard for it. It’s scheduled for 6/5. My personal theory was if I had zero pain in my shins for a full week than I would be ready to run again.

AdvancedRunning,stoutrunning,Benefits of elites running workouts before races vs. after races?,"Yesterday Molly Seidel ran a tempo before her 10K.

I know guys like Rupp and Mo have done similar things - there are videos on YouTube of them running mile repeats &amp; 400s post racing to add more hard training.

My question is not why these elite athletes are adding supplementary workouts to hard race efforts, but rather what is the purpose or intent of adding these sessions pre race vs. post race?

Like is there a significant difference in training benefit for Seidel to run her tempo before her 10K rather than running the tempo post race?",1622324636

This question was prompted by my (male, 37) last two 5Ks:

1. Pre-pandemic 5K, first one I had actually trained specifically for with a dedicated 5K plan. Flat road race, great weather, elevation 4700 feet (I live at about 6600 feet). Result: 20:41 (PR).
2. Yesterday, trail 5K that I found a couple weeks ago. Have been consistently training, but with no particular race in mind. Just holding steady at about 40 MPW, rotating repetition, interval, and tempo workouts with long runs every weekend (general Daniels framework). Only a ""kind of"" taper beforehand. Pretty warm (75+ F), 6600 feet elevation, trails in decent condition but definitely a lot of rocks and roots, 3 tough climbs of over 100 feet in elevation over the course of the race. Result: 22:31.

How would you compare these two races? Would this be cause for concern, or an indication that I'm doing something right? Should I adjust my Daniels VDOT value/training paces in light of my recent race or stay the course? This race was the first of a series that culminates in a 10K (same course), so I'll be doing some more specific training now that I have a target race.",1622304214

My [first marathon was an abject disaster](https://willvedder.com/writing/marathon-postmortem/). I came in undertrained, over-tapered, inadequately fueled, and began way too fast. If there was a rookie mistake in marathon training, I made it. And although it served as a learning experience with many actionable takeaways, it was pretty humiliating. I had wanted redemption ever since I crossed the finish.

My first chance of redemption would come about six month later when I registered for the 2019 Philadelphia Marathon. I meticulously followed Hanson’s Marathon Method, an 18-week plan for intermediates. On my 14th week, one of the final high-mileage weeks before my taper, I felt a burning sensation in my heel: Achilles tendonitis. I cut all activity and aggressively rehabbed, but recovery is in the magnitude of months. I was gutted. Bowing out of the race was the least of my concerns, I’d have to start my training from scratch.

In April 2020, after a six month recovery, I began slowly ramping up my volume again. I was mostly taking it pretty easy, just trying to stay sane in the pandemic summer. Eventually I decided to attempt a marathon time trial, three laps around the Schuylkill loop on the day of the would-be 2020 Philadelphia Marathon. I followed the Pfitzinger 18/70 Plan, a program which spans 18 weeks and peaks at 70 miles per week. During this period, I ran a 1:29:21 half marathon time trial, a four minute personal best. My training was going extremely well and I was in the best shape I’d ever been. Tragically, during the end of my last major long run, I felt a pull in my ankle: posterior tibial tendonitis. After months of rigorous training, I would again need to bow out of my race and effectively lose all my gained fitness. This second blow was particularly devastating, the injury and timing was so similar to the year prior that I felt that I was somehow cursed in a never ending injury cycle.

Better equipped with proper tendonitis rehab techniques, I was able to aggressively rehab and return to completely pain-free running by mid-February. I knew that if I wanted to take one last stab at the marathon, I’d need to do it before it got too hot, otherwise I’d need to wait until the fall. However, I also needed as much time as possible to train and regain some fitness. I finally settled on Saturday, May 16, about fifteenish weeks away.

# Training
Prior to my injury, I had followed Pftizinger’s 18-week Plan that maxes out at 70 miles per week. It follows a weekly routine of one long run, one speed workout, one “medium” long run interwoven with easy mileage and Mondays off. The plan is difficult but manageable, the toughest being those that incorporated race-paced chunks during the weekly long run. For instance, a 17 mile long run would have 13 of those at marathon pace, and that’s after an already grueling training week.

I also liked it because while the plan was prescriptive, it followed a predictable framework that allows easy modifications on the fly, providing some flexibility. This is the main reason that I selected it for my next attempt, coming off the heels of an injury and out of running shape, I would need to reduce the mileage and intensity until my body could sufficiently handle it. Turns out that this flexibility came in handy for two unplanned down weeks with a major illness and significant snowfall, 8 and 15 weeks out respectively.

## Modifications
* Reduce the mileage to about 90-95% of what the plan dictates.
* Stick to all the long runs, opting to include more race-pace mileage than the plan dictates. I did this because I knew it was a weakness of mine and wanted to simulate that effort as much as possible.
* Reduced the length and intensity of speed workouts at first, not doing them as prescribed until about 8 weeks out.

## Strength Training
I also introduced twice-weekly strength sessions. They were mostly a continuation of my injury rehab. Given my susceptibility to injuries and little strength work in the past, this was a no-brainer.

* Calf raises, both eccentric and concentric, loaded with backpack to failure
* Myrtl routine
* Clamshells and side-leg raises with resistance band
* Single leg squats
* Single leg roman deadlifts
* Single leg hip bridges
Adding these strength sessions **were an absolute game changer**. Not only was I avoiding all of the regular pains and niggles that I normally got while training, my entire body felt so much better day-to-day. Previously in periods of heavy training, my calves became so tight and tender that walking was difficult, let alone the crippling fatigue. No longer, I actually felt great! In hindsight, I’m a dummy for waiting so long to incorporate this into my training.

Another thing I did differently was practice fueling during almost every long run. At least one but up to three Maurten gels. This wasn't just to get my GI system accustomed, but to get used to carrying and consuming the gels at race pace.

# The Race
I was originally going to do a time trial around the Schuylkill loop, but with the world opening up, I looked around for races. Lo and behold, one of the only real marathons occurring that weekend was the York County Marathon! How convenient! After a short stint on the waitlist, I was in.

The course was an out and back on the Heritage Rail Trail, a flat gravel path that extends many miles beyond Maryland state lines.

The race wasn’t very large, around 700 participants split equally between the half and full distances, but the organizers still managed crowd sizes by instituting rolling heats every ten minutes from 6-8:30am. In order to manage the effects of the temperature, I opted for the 6am heat. This turned out to be a critical decision, the weather being nearly ideal until later in the morning.

# Goals
With so much heartbreak due to injury the last two years, the primary goal was simple: make it to the start in one piece. Secondly, I wanted to apply the lessons learned from my first marathon and execute on my race plan. Finally, I had a rough time goal in mind.

* **A**: Stay healthy, make it to the start
* **B**: Execute race plan, no preventable mistakes
* **C**: 3 hours 15 minutes

#Race Plan

## Pacing
Recalling my first marathon where I died halfway through because I went out too fast, I knew that I needed to be smarter about pacing. I needed to stay conservative the first half, ramp up the pace to make up time, and then empty the tank the final few miles. 3:15:00 translates into a 7:26 min/mile pace, so I aimed roughly for 7:30-7:35 in the first half and then 7:20 on the way back.

## Fueling
I planned to consume Maurten gels at miles 6, 11, 15 and 20. A mix of caffeinated and non-caffeinated, with the option to take a fifth one with a few miles left. I would carry three from the outset in a fanny pack and rely on Christy to hand me the remaining two later in the race.

I would only Intake fluids only as needed, roughly alternating Gatorade and water. I wanted to be cautious against over-hydrating and cramping.

# Execution

##Prerace
Woke up at the hotel around 4:15am, got my pre-race coffee, chugged my nalgene and a couple of mini bagels. Race area was surprisingly barren, the start area wasn’t even fully set-up until a few minutes before the start. Did a quick jog to warm up and used the bathroom one last time. My 6:00am heat started while I was in the porta potty, I walked out and everyone was already off into the distance, wth? No problem though, I crossed that start a couple minutes late.

## Miles 1-6
Breathing was relaxed, heart rate was in-check, and I was feeling remarkably strong overall. But I didn’t want to lull myself into thinking I could speed up. I needed to stick to the plan and keep it conservative. Even with my late start, it didn’t take long for me to reach the main pack. At mile two I caught up to Mike from Doylestown. Mike and I chatted for a bit and discovered that we had the same 3h15m goal, so we decided to work together and keep our paces honest. We each turned up the intensity somewhere after the halfway point. First Maurten at 5.5.

## Miles 7-14
This stretch was a bit of a blur. The scenery was quite serene but I was too focused to truly enjoy it. The effort was easy and relaxed, but I was falling behind. Mike and I crossed the halfway point on pace for 3h18m, requiring us to run a three minute negative split in the back half, quite the tall task. He wanted to kick it up around the halfway point but I insisted that we wait a few more miles or so. If we could make it to 16 and still feel strong, I thought we’d be in excellent shape.

## Miles 15-21
Still feeling pretty strong up to this point, but the difficulty is starting to seep in. My quad was becoming strained and some serious waves of GI discomfort were washing over me every fifteen minutes. At mile 15 I reach back into my fanny pack to get my third Maurten and I fumble it. Awesome. I decide to run back to get it, I stumble while reaching down, almost falling. I sprint to catch up to Mike, my heart rate spiking briefly.

By now I know that if I want to hit 3h15m, I really need to pick up the pace. I kick it up to around 7:15-7:20 and feel as though I can hold onto that. I see Christy at mile 16, she hands me my final Maurten and I convince her to join me. She stuck with me for two miles and it was exactly the boost I needed. By now, I have separated from Mike and once Christy dropped I was mostly alone. I took my fourth Maurten gel at mile 20, hoping it could help me hold on.

## Miles 22-25
By now I’m laboring. Things are starting to become really difficult. I’ve paid the price for my increased pace and need to slow to about a 7:30 min/mi.

I’m not sure if I needed it, but I had my fifth and final gel at mile 22. Even with the increase in GI distress, I wanted to hedge against myself running out of energy. A little bit of self doubt was beginning to creep in. I knew I’d finish, but it was unknown if I’d continue to negative split. At this point I was just putting one foot in front of the other and holding onto the backs of some of the half marathoners.

## Miles 25-26.2
When the 25th mile marker came up, I knew I had it in the bag. I only had a little bit left in the tank but I surged to &lt;7:00 min/mi pace. Everything was hurting but I had to do this, I had come way too far to let up. I jet by my Aunt and Uncle who are cheering me on. And suddenly I see the finish. I can hear Christy going nuts in the distance. Drawing upon my last few weeks of speed training, I threw myself into an all-out sprint, wrapping up the final quarter mile at my 1000m repeat pace.

Over the line for a **3:15:01** finish.

I fold over, catch my breath and take the moment in. Tried to eat a wrap but my body said, “nah”. Chatted with Mike for a bit, he hit a three minute PR!

# Reflections
Despite being off my goal by a literal second, all around, I was very happy with my performance. 3:15:01 isn’t blistering fast by any means, and I know I’m capable of much faster, but considering my relatively condensed training cycle and various setbacks, I’m proud of the result. A 37 minute personal best!

I hit my other goals of staying healthy and executing well. And above all else, I was thrilled that I didn’t make any of the same mistakes that plagued my inaugural race.

## What Went Right
* **Stayed healthy** - Strength training and moderate mileage kept my body prepared for training.
* **Stuck to the plan** - Went out conservatively, ensuring I would make it to the end without blowing up. Had enough at the end for a nearly 3 minute negative split!
* **Increase in training mileage** - My body was much more prepared for the demands of this distance due to the overall volume of training, especially at marathon pace. This is due in part from the strength training and just acclimation to high mileage training over the years.
* **Improved fueling** - Switching to Maurten Gels which tend to be easier on the stomach and also practicing consuming them during long workouts.

## Trust the Process
One big lesson learned is to trust my training and the taper. There were some workouts where I had to break up the effort into chunks or just couldn’t complete. Despite nailing some other indicative workouts, I had a nagging fear that I was coming in undertrained. But in reality, during these intense workouts, my body was deeply fatigued and tapering was just what I needed to get to 100%.

# Potential Improvements
Despite being pleased with my execution on the day, I still see much room for improvement. The main improvement is being more consistent with the high mileage over the coming months. I believe the biggest thing holding me back is the inconsistency over the course of the year. Granted, a big part of that is due to injuries, so staying healthy through strength training will help with that. But I think another important factor here is mindset and dedication. In past years I’ve taken summers off because of the heat, or otherwise just generally dialed down my running volume outside training blocks.

Speaking of strength training, I still think there is a lot of room for improvement here. I only focus on lower-body work, completely neglecting upper body and core. Furthermore, I’m limited by my lack of equipment, often resorting to household objects to add resistance.

Finally, I need to figure out a better way of carrying my gels for long runs and races. The cheap Amazon fanny pack that I have is a huge hunk of crap and was the source of grief during the race. Not sure exactly how I’ll solve this, but I figure there’s got to be some better product on the market.

# Looking Ahead
Since the effort, I’ve been able to breathe a sigh of relief. It’s been like a rock in my shoe for the last two years that I’ve finally gotten out. I’ll allow myself to take it easy for the next couple weeks and hopefully resume some type of training in the early summer. I have some long-standing PRs in the 5k and 10k that I’d like to topple. I’m already registered for the Philadelphia Marathon in November and I’m really excited to put in a full, beefy block of training for that. I’m expecting another PR. And who knows? Maybe I’ll even go for sub three.",1622302107
AdvancedRunning,Bjarnemann,Worlds worst taper - what can I expect?,"Hi!

I've blinked out tomorrow for a day to test 10k. Not that big of a test - just a fun run for myself without compromising to much of the workouts earlier in the week.

The plan was to run the usual mileage, keep the quality workout on tuesday, but ditch the quality on friday to save some punch.

I got sick, and couldn't run on tuesday! As I think most of you can agree with, it would be COMPLETELY unacceptable to either a) ditch the one quality workout that's left, or b) reduce the mileage. A plan is a plan, and you follow it to death.

So: I've ran quality on wednesday instead. 6*4 min @close to max effort. I thought I've succeeded in keeping some gas in the tank, but thursday and friday told me otherwise. You see, the plan was further to compensate the lack of running on tuesday with MORE running on wednesday-friday.

My base mileage is ~70k/week. So 18k on quality wednesday, 19k on thursday and 13k friday. + 4k active recovery today and badinga tomorrow.

I am really beat up xD It was like running with concrete in my shoes on both wednesday and thursday. No fucking fun at all! Just pain and misery.

To further look like a complete MORON, I'm at a pretty huge deficit. ~ - 1700 kcal wednesday-friday. That has been working very well the last two months, with excellent well being and supreme result both running and lifting wise (strength train 3x/week). But I guess this makes this week even worse.

So, the question is, what can I expect tomorrow? How far will active recovery and a slight surplus (including some bananas, some oats and a semi big portion of pasta) today get me? I'm not stupid, I understand that I can't expect a top effort tomorrow. But looking at my times from training (tempos, intervals), I belive that I on a good day can run at 39, maybe a little bit better.

I know this is impossible to answer, and the question is mostly out of curiosity, but could it be realistic to aim for, let's say 39:30?",1622274590

I am newer to running and think it will work but only question if that hard 2 miles will mess up recovery and require more rest before next run. 

I want to prioritize running more days per week so if I need to split the easy from the hard runs I am cool with it. 

It was just that during yesterday’s easy run I felt like pushing it the last mile and felt great afterwards. It would be great motivation during the boring slow miles to stay slow knowing that I have the fun fast stuff for the finale.",1622250745
AdvancedRunning,BlueberryJunior7338,"Switched back to ""heel"" striking and fixed my Achilles problems.","In high school, I didn't think much about it and I guess I had more of a heel strike when I ran, but I never experienced any injuries. I was never super fast, but I was a top two or three runner on my XC team and made states a handful of times. Around 2 years ago, I switched to a forefoot/toe strike after hearing it was the most efficient style. My form became so ""good"" that when I went to get new trainers and they put me on the treadmill, they tried to get me to lead the nightly beginner running sessions they held on weeknights for the community. Unfortunately, I started developing a nagging Achilles pain any time I started to pick up my mileage and started having to spend crazy amounts of time preparing for my runs by massaging, foam rolling, and warming up with zero drop shoes to get my Achilles to an expectable pain threshold. I thought that my constant Achilles pain was just my body failing to recover like it used to because I was getting older and I kept forging ahead. Recently, I had the brilliant idea to go back to my original foot striking and immediately found it easier to balance the pain in my Achilles and transfer the impact across different parts of my foot when I felt pain elsewhere. Since then, I have been clearing 60 MPW with no problems and I feel no different from my high school days, I might even get back into road racing! If you're experiencing nagging Achilles injuries, you might want to think about whether your foot strike form is the one that comes most naturally to you, sometimes what's good for someone else isn't good for you.

The plan has been to knock off a minute or two by running in my semi-new pair of Hoka Carbon X 2, instead of the Clifton/Rincon/Speedgoat I normally wear. 

I just ran a Marathon tempo run (10 k) in the Carbon X. Half way through I felt my calfs becoming a lot more stiff than usual. And they feel quite twitchy now.

I had similar issues when I tried them on for the first time for a 10 k time trial a couple of months ago and ended up seeing a naprapath. After 10 days of easy running it cooled down on itself.

Anyone else had similar experiences? Or does anyone have some strong arguments on way I should stick with the Carbons? I would really want to have at least the psychological placebo benefit the they provide. But I’m worried that I might mess up the attempt by getting cramps after 30 k.

AdvancedRunning,goothusen,Trainasone is plotting to kill me. Or is it?,"Hi everybody,

I'm currently training for a couple of half marathons later in the year and I'm following a Trainasone (TAO) plan. I like it for it's adjustability and variety but I'm a little concerned that it has me running my slow runs too fast.

A little background on me:

48M, 5'9"", ca. 62 kg  
running consistently since 03/2020  
Finished one 10k and two HM plans during that time  
Currently doing ca. 30 mpw, never done much more, but slowly rising  
10k PB: 44:43 (Testrun, not all out 03/21)  
HM PB: 1:41:51 (TT, 04/2021)  
Max HR: 192

Short story:

Here's my concern in a nutshell: TAO is scheduling so called ""economy runs"" with 5 min warm-up and an ""easy pace"" of a little over 5:30 min/km. These easy runs vary in length, the longest are a little over 2 hours. These are the slowest runs TAO is scheduling. So, is TAO making me run too fast, especially on what would normally be ""long slow distance"" runs?

Long story:

I've been running with TAO since 13th of April and did my second assessment run recently, where tao is asking you to run according to your perceived effort. First for 5 min at ""very easy warm-up pace"" and then for 1:10 at ""natural easy pace"". My average pace during that run was 5:50 with an average HR of 135 (measuring with chest strap), including 2 min standing at the beginning and at the end. A max HR of 147 was achieved towards the end, where I picked up the pace to around 5:33. After that run TAO set my new ""easy pace"" a little over 5:30 and my easy warm-up pace at 6:08 (ran 6:52 during warm-up).

After the first perceived effort assessment, pace was a little lower, at around 5:45 min/km and 6:20 or so. TAO is also regularly scheduling 6 min assessments where you run 6 min for as fast as you can sustain that pace and 3.2 km assessments where you run as fast as you can for 3.2 km, both with some easy running before and after. I've done a couple of these each so far, maybe even three.

Based on all that, TAO is predicting average HR and a HR range for each scheduled workout, als well as the supposed proper pace. The HR predictions are usually pretty accurate, maybe a little higher on average than the actual values. Threshold pace is currently predicted at 4:27, for fast intervals it asks me to run a few seconds below 4:00 min/km. Those are tough for me but I manage to adhere to the planned workout pretty well.

To add to that, runalyze data shows that for may, I've been training almost 40 % with a heartrate between 133 an 144 and almost 35 % between 145 and 154. So, below 80 % mostly.

So, all in all, that does give me some confidence, but: I'm reading so much about much slower pace especially for long runs that I can't help but wonder, whether my training regime is too tough. What do you experts think?

Below you'll find a summary of requirements that I'd like this location to fulfill. Otherwise, I'm very open to your suggestions. 

Location: North America, Caribbean, Europe, and maybe even Africa

Climate: Preferably temperatures of up to 18 - 23 degrees Celsius (64 - 71 Fahrenheit °F) for early morning or evening runs. 

Period: Beginning of July until late September. 

Requirements: 

\+ Access to an all-weather runninng track. 

\+ Access to long-distance trails. Preferably flat with exception for occasional hill runs. 

\+ Access to qualified medical providers such as chiropractor and physiotherapist. 

\+ Access to additional training facilities such as pool, gym, sauna, etc. 

\+ Access to supermarket with wide range of health food choices. 

\+ Access to fully furnished homes with kitchen. I definitely prefer to cook myself. 

\-&gt; Ideally, all these are within walking distance. &lt;-

Earlier in the week I came across u/[JamesFattyHarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesFattyHarden/)'s post about HR training in the Summer: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ngbym5/hr\_training\_in\_the\_summer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ngbym5/hr_training_in_the_summer/)  

Their post made me think about HR training in the winter:

I live in the Southern Hemisphere and I am fairly new to running. I'm interested in people's opinions/experiences training with HR in lower temperatures (0-10°C // 32-50°F). As I come into the winter months I have found my heart rate is already becoming lower in my Z2 runs, . Unsure if this is due to newbie gains or the air temp? Both?

AdvancedRunning,woodensnail0502,[Race Report] The Virginia Triple Crown,"**Race Information**

**Name**: The Triple Crown

**Date**: May 22, 2021

**Distance**: \~35 miles, 9,000+ ft elevation gain

**Location**: Roanoke, VA

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals**:

Don’t get destroyed: ?????

&amp;#x200B;

**Race Background**

The Triple Crown is a 35ish mile loop in southwest Virginia that hits three notable sites on the AT: Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. This isn’t a sanctioned race and is usually done over the course of 2 or 3 days by backpackers. Since my friends and I don’t have that kind of patience, we wanted to get it done in one day.

Some background: Me, my friend and sister attempted this loop back in November. Although we finished, we essentially hiked the entire thing since the leaf cover on the trail was so deep. It took 15 hours, I wanted to die, and swore I’d never do it again. My memory isn’t so good because we were planning a revenge tour a few months later. This time, the trail would be clear enough to run and we would have more on course support. It *had* to go better.

Most of this course is on the AT, and if you’ve ever hiked or ran the AT before you know that it’s rocky, full of roots, and hilly. This course is no exception. Naturally, this makes it slow and we had to plan to be out there for a while. I was hoping to be done in under 10 hours which would be 5 hours less than what I did in November. I have a 50k in the middle of June, so I didn’t want to treat this as a race effort, more so an “adventure run”. The goal was to have a good time (as good as a time you can have running 35 miles) without inducing too much fatigue that would jeopardize my race in June.

A group of five of my friends forgot how much I complained about how terrible this was back in November and decided to join me (including the friend who was there for the first outing). We also had a larger group of friends behind us just hiking a point to point of the three “peaks” (totaling 22 miles instead of 35). The night before, we dropped cars at two parking lots and filled them with water and food so that we’d be able to refuel without going off the trail. This ended up being a huge time saver.

**The Race**

We arrive at the Dragon’s Tooth parking lot at 5am and start the climb up (about 2.2 miles) in the dark. On the way up we’re treated to a fantastic [sunrise](https://imgur.com/a/G6HI4fD). This section of the trail involves a lot of rock scrambling so our miles are pretty slow. One thing the six of us notice is that it’s already hot and humid before the sun had come out. It was supposed to be in the low 80s and cloudy that day in the valley, so we’d hoped that up higher it would be cooler (it wouldn’t). We hang out at Dragon’s Tooth for a few minutes then start heading back down. Eventually we get to the AT and are able to start running.

The course descends from Dragon’s Tooth into a wide open [cow field](https://imgur.com/a/Xz85ICs). Here we had to dodge cows that were standing on the trail, but it was a flat runnable section so we were able to open up a little bit. That was short lived because after about a mile the trail climbs sharply up a ridge. We wind our way along the ridgeline only to descend again into the McAfee Knob parking lot, about 10 miles in. We’re making pretty good time and I’m feeling solid at this point. We refuel on water and food and start the four mile climb up to McAfee Knob. The beginning of this section is actually pretty runnable to my surprise and we start clicking off the miles. The trail gets steep about 1.3 miles to the top and we power hike (walk) the rest of the way. The top of McAfee is actually not too crowded and we stop and get some good pictures. You can see where we’re heading (Tinker Cliffs) on the far right of this [picture](https://imgur.com/a/vnqIiNV). 

We continue along the ridgeline to the final crown, Tinker Cliffs. The group has split up at this point, four of us in front and the other two about 30 minutes behind. This section is also very runnable, starting with a nice easy descent into some short rollers. The trail is a lot less technical here which leads to some quicker miles. So far in the day I’ve been eating every 30 minutes and averaging a little over 200 calories an hour. My stomach feels great (as it usually does) and my energy levels 18 miles in are fantastic. I actually remember thinking that even though we were 18 miles in, it didn’t feel like I had run at all. I was having a great day at that point. I didn’t say this since others in our group weren’t really feeling the same way and I didn’t want to jinx anything. Around this point we start the 1.5 mile and \~900ft ascent up to Tinker Cliffs. I’m feeling great at this point, having no problem getting calories or liquid down and am looking forward to crushing the rest of this course. I was going to get my revenge.

We get to the top of Tinker and the views are [amazing](https://imgur.com/a/QU9vKtR). You can see everywhere you’ve been and where you still need to go. I know there’s a huge descent (3 miles and almost 2,000 feet) coming up, I plan on taking it easy to save my legs so they have plenty left for the last big climb and subsequent 12 miles. We descended without much issue and arrived at the Andy Layne parking lot, where another strategically placed car awaited us with water and food. I felt like a true ultrarunner here, drinking coke and shoving food and salt into my mouth, dumping water over my head and putting ice in the back of my pack to cool off, and telling the rest of the group how we have one more big climb until the home stretch. One person in our group isn’t feeling well and wants to stop here, but we convince her to eat a bunch of food and keep going. We leave the parking lot and start climbing up to North Mountain, gaining back almost all the elevation we lost coming down from Tinker Cliffs.

It’s really starting to heat up at this point and we’re all feeling it, especially during the steeper parts of this climb. Whoever cut the trail was really into making switchbacks, decided those were dumb and had the trail go straight up, then had a change of heart and started making switchbacks again. I’m still feeling good at this point, but our friend who wanted to stop back at the car is not, and decided to turn around and head back about a half mile from the top (she ended up descending 800 feet and ran into the back group, rallied, and finished the course.) After a while we get to the top of North Mountain. The trail flattens out (relatively) and we start running again. It was right at this point a flip switched and I suddenly feel all 25 miles I’d run at once. It was so strange because I can usually feel this kind of fatigue coming on at least 30 minutes to an hour in advance. It’s gotten up to the high 80s at this point and every step becomes a struggle. This trail is the worst, it looks flat-ish on the elevation map but it seems like every time you turn a corner there’s another climb ahead of you. All hopes of crushing this section are dashed and I’m in damage control mode. I’m trying to eat as much as I can (stomach still feels fine) but I just do not want to run another step and can’t fathom that I have 8 to 9 more miles to go. The pity party is in full swing and every second is agony. I can’t emphasize enough how miserable I felt here and my goal of “don’t get destroyed” is out the window since I am getting wrecked. It feels like the climbs will never end, and every time the trail flattens out enough to run, it’s either covered in rocks, overgrown, or both. In fact, there seemed to be more and more rocks on the trail the closer we got to the end. My brain is mush and I can’t focus enough to run efficiently on the technical trail and start rolling my ankles, leading to more frustration. I want off this God forsaken mountain, the Triple Crown has crushed me again. Our three person group has essentially split up at this point, each of us determined to get to the finish to be done with it.

After two hours of suffering I finally get to the switchbacks that mean there’s about a mile to go. You’d think that a one mile descent would be great at this point, but the entire trail was covered in just rocks. Every time I’d try and get some momentum going I’d almost trip or roll an ankle and have to walk for a minute. Plus, it’s getting hotter and hotter as I descend. I’m ready to be done. Eventually I reach the bottom, get back to the car, and sit in the shade on a rock while I try and cool off, contemplating why I do these things to myself.

**Autopsy**

I’m going to chalk up the ending of this race to dehydration, overheating, and under fueling, but I still don’t understand how it hit me all at once. I’m usually pretty good at gauging how I feel and I felt good the entire day up until the last 9 miles so I don’t know what happened. I am really happy with how my stomach felt, I think it’s definitely one of my competitive advantages to be able to eat just about anything while running and still feel fine. Next time I think I’ll up my caloric intake to 250-300 calories an hour and see how that feels. I will be back to beat this course, I am not going to quit that easily.

### Training

It was pretty obvious going into this that I would have minimal training, and likely would(will) end up with some form of injury. With that in mind, the day after my initial baseline time trail (5:45 with no cardio for 7 months mentioned in the first thread I made), I was feeling good about what I could accomplish in 30 and 60 days of training. I decided to go for a short run in the mountains the following day, instead of taking a day or two to recover (bad choice). This resulted in some long lasting calf pain that set the stage for the perfect combo of low miles and just about zero track workouts for the 30 days. In total I was able to get 13 runs in, totaling 52 miles (longest run of 6 miles), 2 of which were track workouts. Yep, minimal at best. I was initially shooting for around 25mpw average for the first 4 weeks of training, with at least 4-5 track workouts and 4-5 tempos. I ended up at 13mpw with 2 track workouts and 2 tempos (if you can call them that). The two track workouts consisted of mile warm ups, then 10x200 on 200 off (\~41/60) for the first workout, and 200,300,200 x 3 for the second (\~39,56,39) with 200,100,5min recovery). Came up with these during the warm up mile since I had no idea how I might feel, or whether or not my calves would make me hit the eject. 

There's not much else to discuss, hopefully the next 30 days will go well! My calves felt better during the final week so I'm optimistic about getting more miles in. 

My 60 day goal was 4:36. I am very confident that won't be happening. I can't take back that goal, but a more realistic one is likely 4:48 so I'll train with that in mind. 

### Prerace

Well hydrated and had a good meal the morning of. I was holding out since it was a fairly windy day (15mph + gusts), but decided to head to the track around mid day since it looked like it would get worse the longer I waited. I got a solid 800m warmup followed by some mild stretching and lots of questioning if I should bail and head home. With some extra motivating songs I convinced myself to spike up and hit a few strides (might be worth noting I had not worn spikes during the 2 track workouts mentioned). I queued up a handful of songs and toed the line. 

### Race

It was windy, and I went out a little faster than I planned with the wind at my back. 36 through 200 felt comfortable, until I started coming out of the curve and realized how much help I had been receiving. 76 through 400 was okay, but I already knew I wasn't going to run the next three as consistently as one could hope. At 600 I was thinking about how the last 1000m workout I did felt, and what the remaining 1000m were going to feel like. Coming through 800 in 78 (2:34) was a huge relief, I was certain I had fallen off more than that. This gave me some reassurance that I would at least make it through in 5:20.  I don't think a single thought came to me during the 3rd lap. I came through in 80, then did some incredible poor math during the next 50m and convinced myself that sub 5 was only  71seconds away (no idea how that happened, but it was not 71 away, it was 64 away). It didn't matter either way, I came through the final 400m in  75 and decided the grass needed some cuddling. 

### Post-race

After laying down for awhile I finally looking at my watch and saw 5:10. It was at that moment I realized I have no idea how to do math during a race, but I also was happy that I ran close to 5 flat. Overall, there's not a whole lot to take away. Maybe, ""Play stupid games win stupid prizes"". In this case I was too eager to start training hard and set myself back quite a bit. I might have to extend this to 90 days just to see if there's a lot leftover. 

Any prediction for the 60day mile? General thoughts, prayers for my calves, etc?

meh, mission failed we'll get em next time.

AdvancedRunning,UcfBioMajor,Vaporfly 4%?,"Hi all,
 I’m training for wineglass in the fall to hopefully BQ. I’ve been training in Altra Torin Plush the last few marathons which I love but I wanted to try a carbon plate and a lighter shoe. I went to my local running store today and they just had the vaporfly 4%, I was kinda hoping to get the next % but when I tried on the vaporfly they felt great. I know nothing about the vaporfly, and ideally I’d like to support my local running store. Coming from Torin plush I’m assuming I’ll be faster regardless since it’s less heavy of a shoe and it’s got a carbon plate. Would you hold out and get the Next% instead? Or is the difference negligible to a non elite runner like myself?

## Training

I ran a 40:10 time trial on the last day of the year in 2020, after progressively growing my mileage over the year and ending up doing 2600 over the whole year. Going into 2021 I wanted to improve my 10k and focus solely on that distance during the year. I have never broken 40 before, and being so close on that time trial, I set my focus on that. I started Pfitzinger's second 10k plan: 12 weeks ranging from 72 to 91km (45-67mi). I was comfortable running 70-80km a week so I knew I can attempt it.

Overall the plan was great. Running 6 days a week with two quality runs and a long run was challenging at some points but I never felt too exhausted. Pfitz has you running LT intervals most weeks (for example, 14-12-10 min) and I thought these were key. Also strides on the easy GA days helped with finding a new top-end speed.

At the beginning of week 7, I had to stop in the middle of a workout because my right ankle blew up. I couldn't run on it anymore so I decided to hobble home. The whole part was swollen and got me worried because it wasn't getting better after a couple of days. I went to the doctor and after a checkup and an x-ray, we discarded anything major so I blame fatigue and maybe poor form making my shin give up. I took it easy for a couple of weeks, only going out about 2-3 times a week and around 25km each week. After that, the pain went away and I decided to move my target race 4 weeks back and signed up for the Dorney Lake 10k here, my first official race this year.

After that, I restarted the plan the week before and from then on, it all went according to plan. I got all my workouts in, including my highest mileage week ever, at 93km.

I had two tune-up races too:

* 4 week before race day, Pfitzinger has a 5k tuneup race. I'm signed up for a virtual running league with some friends, and it has races every month, so I used this tuneup to run a 10k time trial. With no taper and after a normal training week, I ran a [39:28 around home.](https://www.strava.com/activities/5182076179) First time under 40, and it gave me a massive boost of confidence going forward to the actual race.
* 2 weeks before, another and final 5k tuneup. This time I ran an actual [5k time trial and ran 18:34](https://www.strava.com/activities/5262674953/), with very consistent splits and feeling strong.

## Pre-race

I was trying to find out a bit more information about the course since I've never run it before. It's an artificial lake that was created for the rowing event for the 2012 London Olympics, and it's exactly a 5 loop, making the 10k a two-loop course. After lurking on Strava for a while, it seemed that most people got around 10.10km on their GPS, so I was a bit worried about timing my splits properly because I'd had to account for the extra 100m at the end.

I woke up around 7 and had my usual breakfast of toast with peanut butter and coffee. I got everything ready and drove to Dorney before my scheduled race start at 10:30. On the drive day, I had a banana too.

When I got there, I walked over to pick up my bib, fill out the safety information and went straight for a warmup run. Ran 2km at around 4:20(km) with some strides and felt strong. My shoe choice for the day was the Saucony Endorphin Speed.

Once I was done with the warmup, I walked over to the start line, pushed down a gel and did a bit more dynamic warmup. Being a COVID-safe event, there wasn't a mass start and basically, everyone would just walk up to the start line and start running whenever they were ready (we were all given a time slot). I watched a few runners start, and when I felt ready, I walked over to start.

## Race

Starting practically on your own is a weird feeling, but since it's a looped course and on the same day they had a 5k, 10k and a Half, the moment you go on the course, people are already doing their loops. My plan for the day was to keep the first 5k conservative and to push in the second half, just to avoid blowing up.

I immediately found my comfortable pace and started focusing and keeping it smooth and with good form. The course is completely flat, and although there's no shelter, thankfully there wasn't much wind today. At some points, I had to take over some runners, but overall the tarmac was pretty wide. My main data point was my heart rate and pace. I know I can maintain a high heart rate and roughly where my limit is, so my main goal was to keep the first 5k under 190bpm. For some reason, it also seemed that my watch was behind compared to the km markers on the course. Every time I would pass 1km, 2km, 3km, etc., my watch was around 100-150m behind. This made me think that maybe I might be pushing too hard, but I hope that at the end it would just work out.

Splits: 3:55 / 3:55 / 3:55 / 3:53 / 3:52 (chip split for the first 5k: 19:41)

Going into the second half, I was already starting to push over the fifth km, and I knew I can find a bit more speed in my legs. I picked up the pace a bit, and was consistently getting faster each one. KM8 was the toughest one because it includes a sharp turn towards the final 2km stretch, as well as a mini bridge. At this point, I was starting to breathe hard but I was feeling strong. Heart rate was around 194-195 already. With the completely final stretch in front of me, I started to pick up the pace for the last push, and I was taking over runners left and right. It was a great feeling, and I knew that there is a slight chance I can go under 39 if I push hard enough and the watch is not too inacurate. The last km was a blur, and I sprinted across the finish line in 38:55. Goal A achieved with a perfectly paced race.

Splits: 3:51 / 3:51 / 3:52 / 3:47 / 3:45 (chip split for second 5k: 19:14)

## Post-race

I sat down for a bit just to catch my breath and eat a cereal bar they were giving out. I was ecstatic for the result but also felt sad that there was no crowd to watch, and no one was allowed to come to watch me finish. Despite that, I'm grateful that races are back after all we've been through!

Next, I'm going to take a couple of weeks a bit easier, and then I need to decide what to do. My options are either to repeat the same training plan again or move on to the next level, which peaks around 110-120km. Thoughts?

Thanks for reading!

AdvancedRunning,Carter994,IT band syndrome,"I'm suffering from a severe case of ITBS, in the sense that it just won't go away no matter what I do;

I started 10 months ago. I was first misdiagnosed by my doctor and 2 other physical therapists. The third one diagnosed ITBS and released the pain in one session by massasging and dry needling. It came back about a week later. Since then I have tried everything he recommened and that I could think of.  I'm using podiatric orthotics, I've been stretching, foam rolling my TFL, glutes and vastus lateralis. I had been doing hip and glute strenghtening exercises from home, because of covid for 2 months, but I had trouble connecting to and feeling my glutes during exercises, other muscles took over. So for the past 2 months I've been training with my PT, doing leg strenght work, stability, core and balance. Very slowly improving over time, but I can't tell if it's the exercises doing work, or just the fact that I am not aggrevating it. 

However, every time I do inadvertently end up aggrevating it. Whether it's bending my knees too far to pick something up, helping a friend move and thus putting pressure on it, trying a squad like my PT recommended or just general life stuff that requires you to bend or put pressure on your leg. This puts my ""progres"" back a month again before I'm at the same level of pain/pressure I can tolerate. It's always 1 step forward, 3 steps backward. 

All in all I've been training to recover for about 5 months and I'm nowhere close to recovery. It's extremely frustrating to be in pain with every daily movement and just to not be able to life the live I want. 

Is there anything else that I can do? What are the next steps if this all won't help? Has anyone had similar experiences?",1621694244

I've climbed up to 18 miles at Pfitzinger long run pace (10-20% slower than MP) this way, but the post-run crash was a fact of life for me. Today in addition to my normal post-run smoothie I had a serving of Gatorade endurance powder and a glass of a homemade electrolyte mix consisting of 1tbs sugar, 1/4tsp salt, and the juice of half a lemon.

It's just one day but the difference is unreal compared to prior weekly long runs. I'm able to concentrate on work calls and don't feel the need to nap early afternoon, and would say my energy levels are on par with a normal day of running for me.

Maybe most people on this sub have already caught on to proper refueling, but for any that haven't I highlight recommend it after long runs or even sweaty hard efforts.",1621619474
AdvancedRunning,Fabulous-Mistake151,Hello Advanced Runners. I am looking for some advice on the following situation regarding return from injury.,"I was injured in 2018 and ran my marathon PR of **2:53:29** at Boston. Before that, I had PR'ed in the Half with **1:17:14**. The last two years have been a living nightmare for my running career. Injuries, and Tendonitis. I haven't been able to run consistently for long stretches up until this year in January. I had bouts where I would go a couple of months, but it became recreational for most of the time. My fitness wasn't non-existent, but it was not run specific at all. I had a death in the family and turned to Marijuana for a year, but have recently quit. I am averaging 30mpw since late February. I am signed up for the Chicago Marathon, cause I am a midwest runner. The summer heat is my worst season in terms of performance. I am also currently battling a muscle imbalance which could be the result of the time I took off combined with several injuries from patellar tendonitis. I feel most healthy and able to handle a milage increase to 35-40.

My ""easy"" pace is 7:20-7:30

Haven't done any workout other than strides

The longest run is 12 miles.

For the last 2 1/2 months, I have been averaging about 30mpw

Again... I feel mostly healthy.

Is it possible to secure a sub-3 hour reasonably? I really want to qualify again for Boston. 

Is anything faster possible?

Is my half marathon time something that I can repeat this year as well?

AdvancedRunning,mark--dynamicbalance,I'm physiotherapist &amp; expert in running related chronic pain/gait. AMA,"I am Mark St. Peter, I've worked as a Physio for 30 years in San Francisco. I have worked with many runners over the years. I have helped young runners overcome ankle issues, I have helped middle-aged runners overcome knee issues, (I have helped folks with artificial joints run again). I have helped older people in their 60s who haven't run for 20 years run again. I also currently coach multiple runners ranging from 5k speedsters to centurion ultramarathoners. 

The inescapable reality of running is: It is an intense high volume, repetitive motion. In running, there is a tremendous impact with every stride. It's ones ability to maintain foundation strength and control these forces that prevents running from causing pain. 

If you have no pre-existing trauma or pathologies, no previous injuries, or other known limitations, the pain related to your running can quite likely be eliminated by adjusting your gait through to a flowing more neutral stride.

The added benefit of improving your gait is that it'll substantially help your speed since the fundamental issue that needs to be fixed is force not being transferred forward.

I'll do my best to answer every question. I can't give medical advice but I can tell you which expert you need to see, recommend simple exercises to relieve your pain, give advice on how to improve your gait, and anything else in my scope. Ask me anything.",1621606817

AdvancedRunning,Dustintomi,Last Sole Standing Backyard Ultra Race Report,"**Training**

The second half of 2020 was a rough time for my running. Luckily, I was largely unaffected by Covid but my running definitely took a hit. With no in-person races to look forward to, my training lacked consistency and focus. In November, I was able to sign up for the Trail of Fears Backyard Ultra being held in December. I tried to get my training back on track but I struggled mentally due to the loss in fitness. I continued barely training, so I wasn’t feeling fit, so I didn’t want to train, and so on and so on. It was a rough cycle.

Eventually, I showed up on race day with very low expectations. I ran the race very cautiously and ended up running really well. More importantly, I was reminded how much I enjoyed racing and competing. It was enough to relight the fire. I also started streaking at the beginning of 2021 to force consistency. I don’t think streaking is typically a good thing but it’s always helped me when I get way off track.

My goal for the first half of the year was to win the [Last Sole Standing Backyard Ultra](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=73283). This is Kentucky’s Backyard Ultra and this year it had many of the best long ultra guys in the state. The more I looked at the entrant list the more I realized that this was a very deep race with a lot of solid runners. I figured there would be around 10-15 that would make it through 100 miles and a few that had a good shot of going over 150.

[My training](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11884155) started the first week in January, I did 53 miles with a 17.5 mile long run. Not too shabby, but a long way from being ready to put in up to 200 miles over 48 hours. My training progressed well and I slowly started feeling more like the runner I used to be.

In the middle of February, my family took a trip to Arizona to get away from the cold for a bit and run the Pemberton Trail 50K. I had no idea what to expect from the race. It seemed like my fitness was coming along nicely but I only had 5 weeks of good training. I ended up blowing all of my goals out of the water and running [a huge PR of 3:24](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/lnm2t5/pemberton_trail_50k/). On top of that I felt good the next couple days and was able to explore more of the trails around Phoenix. I went back home feeling confident and excited to continue my training.

My parents found a very flat and fast 50k in late March so I decided to join them again to try to lower my new PR on an even easier course. Again, I was able to exceed my expectations and I ran a 3:10. I started feeling fit, at least at relatively short distances.

I ran ultra distances for the first four weekends in April to build my endurance. I started with a 28 mile day running a pretty hilly trail FKT. The next weekend, I did a 10k loop every hour for 5 hours starting at 3 AM. I knew the super early morning would be tough on race day so I wanted to try to practice running at that time. Next I did 28 miles with a solid negative split. 6 days later I ran a 39 mile FKT on a fairly hilly asphalt/ concrete path. April ended up being my highest mileage month ever. I started my taper feeling very strong and confident.

**Race**

My parents and I got to the course Friday evening and set up our camp. We were a bit further away from the start/ finish and in the second row of tents. It wasn’t ideal but I didn’t worry too much about it. Walking an extra 20 feet each loop wasn’t ideal but it wasn’t going to make or break the race. We could probably move closer by the time it really mattered anyway. We got most of our stuff set up and headed back to the hotel.

The next morning, we went to the start and finished unpacking the absurd amount of food we brought.  About 10 minutes before the start, the first disaster happened. I had realized the night before that I forgot my watch charger. I didn’t expect it to be an issue because my watch has a really long battery life but I decided to turn it off anyway to save a little. I tried to turn it on to get GPS and nothing happened. I tried pushing the other buttons, nothing happened. I tried pushing multiple buttons, nothing happened. I couldn’t get it to turn on. I started digging through my stuff and found my old watch, also dead. I looked for it’s charger, no luck. In backyards, you have to be super careful with pacing. Too fast and you’ll blow up, too slow and you won’t have time to refuel or worse you won’t make it back in time. This is not a good event to go off feel. My friend Zack was at the race crewing our friend Robbie and was able to figure out the answer thanks to Google. Apparently, you have to hold the button for 15 seconds to turn the watch on… seems a bit excessive to me.

The plan was to run loops between 54 and 56 minutes. This would let me take it nice and easy but still have plenty of time to do whatever I needed between loops. [I was going to drink 14 ounces of SWORD during each loop and eat some food between loops.](https://imgur.com/XeFOZo8) I went a bit overboard on food options, I had donuts, cookies, candy, chips, Nutella and almond butter roll ups, Boost, trail mix, nuts and more. I also had some gels but I wanted to stick to real food if my stomach would let me.

My Mom was also doing the race so I planned to stick with her. She would keep me from being dumb and running 40 minute loops and I would help make sure she was making it through with enough time. My dad was crewing for us and making sure we had everything we needed. He’s crewed me for all of my long ultras and I can’t imagine doing one without him.

The gun went off and we slowly headed out. Mom and I quickly fell into last place. The loop is a mixture of meadow trails and some ATV trails through the woods. It’s mostly gently rolling with 2 solid hills. It isn’t terrible but certainly not an easy loop. The one really nice thing is that the last mile is all pretty easy. If you were to get a bit behind it would be easy to make up a bit of time. [We made it through the first loop](https://imgur.com/x8AsBGn) just under 56 minutes and solidly in last place. I was shocked that no one else was around, I would have guessed that more people would hang out in the mid to upper 50s. The second loop was basically the same.

We headed back to the start line for loop 3 as I [finished my donut](https://imgur.com/wqpBcJy). After I took the last bite I realized something was wrong. My hands were empty; they aren’t supposed to be empty. I had left my handheld sitting next to my chair. It was still early and it was nice and cool so not a big deal but not how I wanted to start the race. My dad tried to run over and grab it but there wasn’t enough time. On this loop my mom started to struggle. Her heart rate shoots way up on uphills and this course was a lot hillier than we expected. [We made it in](https://imgur.com/0NZoFAe) about the same time as the previous loops but it was taking more out of her.

On the 5th loop Mom was really struggling. I had to head off on my own part of the way through the loop. It was really cool spending over 4 hours running with her. We haven’t run together in a long time so it was a really nice experience. I can’t wait to do another backyard ultra with her with a little less elevation. I finished the loop and headed back out for loop 6. I had barely left the start when I heard a bunch of cheering from behind. I turned around and watched her running through the finish. It hadn’t looked like she was going to make it early in the loop, she must have really pushed throughout the loop to be that close. It was awesome seeing her push through a tough day.

Eventually all of the loops started to blend together. Everything becomes familiar and routine. Luckily, I knew a lot of people in the race so I was able to distract myself and pass the time by chatting and hanging out with different people. This was especially fun after a year of almost exclusively running by myself. I was amazed how the miles and loops flew by as I [enjoyed the day with old and new friends.](https://imgur.com/uHz97h5)

[I linked up with Robbie](https://imgur.com/5Sbz6Du) around the 7th or 8th loop and we really got into a groove. I knew he was trying to get over 50 miles for the first time and based on how we were going I figured he had some more in him. I find the middle miles in backyards to be really challenging. The first few loops are exciting as the race is starting and you’re getting used to the course. Before long though the novelty starts to wear off, and you start to feel the miles adding up. No matter how fit you are, running 20 or 30 or 40 miles isn’t exactly easy. I don’t know if anyone can get through that kind of mileage entirely unscathed. It can be a bit scary when you’re already feeling it and you probably still have over 100 miles to go. I wanted to avoid this by forgetting my race for as long as possible. I was just going to help Robbie get over 50 miles, and then force him through as many more loops as he could do. After that I would need to find something else to distract me from the loops that lay ahead.

I was feeling good through these middle miles. I was able to keep my heart rate nice and low, I very rarely felt like I was working and if I ever noticed that I was I would ease up. The clock wasn’t an issue as we were finishing in 53 to 55 minutes each loop. There was plenty of time to sit down, relax and refuel between each loop. The only issue that I had was getting my right shoe tied correctly. I had it a little too tight at the top and it started to bother a tendon on the front of my ankle. I unlaced the top section of my shoe and it got a lot better.

The loops seemed to be flying by and before we knew it we were on the 11th. Only one more loop and we would hit 50 miles and switch to the much easier road loop for the night. I started counting down the hills that were left. Only 3 more hills after we topped the hill that I liked. Then only 2 more after the hill I didn’t like.

Finally, we started loop 12. I was excited to get through it and switch from the trail to the road as we crossed through the major milestone of mile 50. Around 3 miles in I stopped to go to the bathroom. As I started back up the tendon on the front of my foot kind of locked up. I limped along for a little bit before it loosened back up. I was very grateful that after this loop I could switch out of my trail shoes and into something different. This had never been an issue before and I figured (and hoped) that switching up my shoes and taking some Ibuprofen would clear it up quickly.

I finished the 12th loop and 50 miles in a little over 54 minutes. I headed back over to my camp to [switch my socks and shoes](https://imgur.com/rsWpmjy) and refuel. With the extra time I decided to stretch my ankle a bit before putting on my new shoes. I heard the whistle sound and thought “alright, 2 more minutes” and slowly started getting my shoes ready. The next thing I knew I heard “5, 4”. “What’s happening” I thought as I jumped up 1 shoe still untied. “3, 2” I raced out of my tent but I was blocked by other tents and there wasn’t a clear path to the start. “1, \*gong noise\*”. I froze. I was out, my race was over. I sat back down stunned. [It was an almost perfect 12 hours and 50 miles](https://imgur.com/mf2bIMO). I felt great. I was eating and drinking a lot and my stomach was perfectly happy. I was in great shape but it didn’t matter. I lost focus and missed the start of the 13th loop. I’m not sure if I misheard the 1 minute whistle and thought it was 2 minutes or if I was right about it being 2 minutes and just zoned out and missed the 1 minute. Either way, it was over.

Zack headed back to Robbie’s to tent to get him ready for the next loop when he saw me. He looked startled as he saw me sitting in my tent. “What happened?” he asked. “I… I missed it”",1621526529

AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Eisenhower Marathon – First time with a Daniels’ Marathon Plan,"This race was almost 3 weeks ago, but it was difficult to get motivated to write a race report for a race that didn’t go as I had hoped.
______
**Background**

For my [first marathon (2016)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/4caure/wicked_marathon_first_marathonxpost_from_rrunning/), I followed Pfitz’s 18/55 marathon plan with some extra miles that had me averaging 50 mpw over the cycle, peaking around 62 mpw, and ran 3:17.  

[Next marathon (which happened to be this race)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/64qr6y/eisenhower_marathon_race_report_great_day_to_run/), I decided to up the game a bit and did a hybrid of Pfitz’s 18/70 and 18/87 plans.   I averaged 68 mpw over the cycle, peaking at 82 miles.  I knew I’d be sacrificing some quality to get that jump in mileage quantity but was okay with that for this cycle.  I was feeling very strong going into the race and decided to make an attempt at sub-3.  I was doing okay through half, put had some issues with several things (weather, fueling, hydrating) and ended up bonking and ran/walked it in for 3:15.  

For [my third one (Chicago) ]( https://www.reddit.com/r/artc/comments/9n031t/chicago_marathon_report_making_up_for_last_time/), I followed Pfitz’s 18/70 for the most part, but swapped VO2 workouts for CV workouts.  All-in-all, I felt very strong after this cycle (64 mpw average, peak at 80).  Going into race day, I felt very solidly in 3:02-ish shape, but with some great pacing by /u/jaylapeche made an attempt for sub-3.  Had to back off at 23 due to my calf failing me, but finished happily with a solid BQ, 3:02:43.
____


**Training**

After having done Pfitz for several cycles, I decided to give some other options a try.  I very good luck with JD’s 5k plan in 2019 and having seen the 2Q plan used many times in various subs, I decided to give it a try.  I went with the 70 mpw plan and wanted to try to keep most of my weeks in the 60’s.  That seems to be a good mileage for me, allowing me to hit the workouts/mileage and still recover.

When I started the plan, I wasn’t absolutely sure my goal race was going to happen.  Even without the pandemic, close races are few in my area so I didn’t have many choices.  The race is the one I blew up on in 2017 so I also wasn’t thrilled about that, but I had worked hard on my fueling strategy since then to avoid any more bonks.  A few weeks into the plan, I found out that the race was indeed happening, but under new management and had shifted 4 weeks later.  Now my 18-week plan had turned into 22 weeks.  In the end that turned out to be useful as I had a couple of blah weeks which I was able to repeat.  I also had two weeks toward the middle of the frigid temps that hit much of the country and some travel which gave me a mini-break.  

For the most part, I hit most of the plan as written with some minor tweaks here and there.  I based my M and E paces off of my goal time (sub-3), but I ran T, I, and R more based off my 5k PR although that was a bit old.  Training paces for sub-3 were 6:29, 5:58, 41s (200) for T, I, and R respectively.  I was using a T pace closer to 6:20 in previous cycles so opted for that instead, but typically ran closer to 6:15 for T pace with no issues.

*Weekly mileage progression*  

56, 58, 56, 64, 66, 60, 61, 62, 64, 60, 50, 41, 60, 65, 70, 61, 72, 68, 62, 56, 52, 53 (Average = 60)

*Important runs*

Week 6 of the plan had one of the bigger [marathon paced runs](https://www.strava.com/activities/4594923122) and it went extremely well.   I was able to run it at my small loop by work which was nice since it is all on pavement, flat, and since it was a small loop, I wouldn’t be running into a headwind for very long at one time.  Goal M was 6:50 and splits ended up being 6:54, 6:51, 6:50, 6:48, 6:45, 6:44, 6:47, 6:44, 6:46, 6:53, 6:48, 6:48, 6:45, 6:40 (avg 6:47).  

Week 16 was a big week for quality with one session being [8M, 3x1T](https://www.strava.com/activities/4970575241).  I lucked out on a day with slightly calmer winds and the workout went very well.  Goal M pace was  6:45 and 6:15 for T.  M Splits were 6:47, 6:48, 6:42, 6:40, 6:43, 6:48, 6:51, 6:45 (avg 6:46); T splits were 6:05, 6:14, 6:04 (avg 6:08).  Went a bit hot on the T splits accidently.  Tough workout, but within reach.

Second quality session of Week 16 was [long run w/ 12M]( https://www.strava.com/activities/4987902527).  It was crazy windy (20+ mph sustained winds out of the south with higher gusts) so I had my wife drop me off so I could do a point-to-point run with the wind at my back.  Planned for 6:45 as goal pace, adjusted to 6:40 for the tail wind.  Splits were 6:49, 6:40, 6:42, 6:40, 6:39, 6:38, 6:40, 6:45, 6:41, 6:46, 6:46, 6:40 (avg = 6:42).  Miles 11.5-13.5 were the toughest as I turned west and had the crosswind.  My Stryd had Air power averaging about 7% for those miles with maxes of 18%.

Got a good tempo run in during Week 17 although I adjusted this from the written 3x2T, 1T.  I planned for 3x2T, but had to make an adjustment on the last rep to [2x2T, 2x1T]( https://www.strava.com/activities/5011400556). Not too upset about.  I was having a bit of trouble regulating pace and overshot goal pace on a couple of miles which didn’t help me at all trying to get the whole workout done.  Goal T was 6:15; splits were 6:18, 6:16, 6:06, 6:19, 6:07, 6:09 (avg: 6:13).

*Conclusions from Training Plan*

After having done several Pfitz (with good results), I have to say that I’m a fan of Daniels’ plans.  There was definitely a bit more flexibility in scheduling.  With only having to focus on 2 quality days, it is much easier to switch things around a bit.  This is helped by Daniels making the workout sessions closer to Pfitz’s MLR distance.  Pfitz plans can be a bit tough to rearrange the workout and MLR to allow enough recovery for the long runs.  I also enjoyed the variety of run paces with-in the quality sessions although running M and T in the same workout seemed a bit daunting at first as well as including T miles in the long run.  I’ve heard from others that the workouts for each mileage level can be tough and recommend doing the workouts from the next lower mileage tier.  While I didn’t specifically do that, I did modify most of the workouts a bit to make them more manageable.

It was hard to compare this cycle to my last one, partially because that was 2.5 years ago and different seasons.  I will say that overall my fitness has steadily improved as both recovery and E paces are lower at the same effort so that’s good to see.

____________
**THE RACE**

I’ve run the [Eisenhower Marathon]( https://eisenhowermarathon.net/) twice before (one has a training run and one has a race that didn’t end well, see above), so I was very familiar with the course.  The race was under a new RD, but I didn’t think things would change too much.  It’s a decent course although a 2-loop course.

The course an out-and-back that is sort of shaped like a T with the start at one end of an arm. It goes about 2 miles to the base which is a lollipop through a park, then a short arm to the turnaround at 6.55 miles. You run the lollipop one way for the “out” and the other way for the “back”. The marathon runs the course twice.

First couple of miles are very flat before a short, steep hill leading into the park.  The park is very flat and shaded which is nice as the rest of the course is completely exposed.  A few gentle hills to the turnaround and then back through the park to the start line.  The biggest concerns are wind from the north or south as the majority of the race is run that direction as well as sun/heat as there is very little shade.
___

*Fueling*

Tailwind has been my go-to for awhile now.  I mix it 3X concentration and have two ~10oz bottles to give about 600 cal for the race.  I typical take some swigs every 2 miles and grab water at the aid stations.
___
*Goals heading into race day:*

A+ goal: 2:57
 
A goal: sub-3:00

B goal: safe-ish BQ (3:10)

I felt pretty good about my fitness for a sub-3:00, but knew if the weather was against me, I’d need to adjust.
___
**Race Day**

My wife and I drove to Abilene late the night before and stayed at a nice Victorian B&amp;B that we had stayed at the last time.  Got unpacked and laid out what I could to make things easier for an earlier start.

Up at 4:30 to start getting ready and get to breakfast at 5:00.  The owners of the B&amp;B are very runner friendly and do an early breakfast for anyone running.  My wife opted for the fancier breakfast at 8:30 and stayed in bed.  I met up with a fellow Kansan and redditor (and his wife) at breakfast and talked over goals.  His was much faster than mine, but we were both worried how the weather was going to play out.  Start was going to be comfortable at upper 50s, but it was going to be 70 and sunny by 3 hours in and the wind was going to be picking up as well.

Ate my oatmeal, banana, and coffee and headed back upstairs to get my gear ready.  Sipped on some Tailwind on the way to packet pickup and met up with several other Team Beef members.  This race usually draws a large number of them.


*Start Line and out to the Highway (6:44, 6:48, 6:45)*
No warmup for the marathon so just with the other runners, leave my stuff with my wife, and then line up close to the start line (https://i.imgur.com/kw1ewfb.jpg) sporting my Team Beef jersey and ARTC moose hat.  I know there are going to be some fast runners there and I recognize one of the guys who usually wins this race.  I ask what he’s shooting for this year and he says hoping for high 2:30’s but unsure as he hasn’t raced in 18 months.

Go through the normal national anthem and countdown and [we’re off](https://i.imgur.com/RBPFML6.jpg).
I was really hoping this year to have a small group to run and maintained that glimmer of hope for about 0.5 miles then everyone separated into groups and as usual, [I was on my own](https://i.imgur.com/iI91sD2.jpg).  The lead pack was 6 or 7 strong and going out hard with a few between me in 10 or so.  The HM started at the same time so it was a bit difficult to know who was in which race without seeing bibs.
No choice now but to settle into my own race and stay on target.  First 3-ish miles are nice and flat so easy to settle in and cruise.

*Park (6:46, 6:51)*

Hit the short, steep bit to head up to the park entrance which sucks, but is over quick.  Still feeling good.  Fueling going as planned.  Couple of swigs of Tailwind every 2 miles and grab a bit of water at the aid stations.  Luckily, because of the pandemic, they were handing out water in small bottles.  It was nice to grab one without worrying about spilling half of it and then try to drink the other half without sloshing it all over.  I could hold the bottle and sip for awhile and toss at the next aid station.

Through the [park is nice as there is a bit of tree cover]( https://i.imgur.com/Uksgcmf.jpg).  Temps are still good, but the sun is getting going at this point.  The park is where  lot of spectators sit as the runners pass though one spot 8 times.  Got lots of “Go, Team Beef”, but I am in my own world so just give a small wave.  Pretty flat here with one very short, steep hill before the incline to go back out of the park.

*Turnaround (6:50, 6:41, 6:43)*

Once out of the park, it’s back in the open and a gentle incline and rollers almost the whole way to the turnaround.  We pass by a greyhound rescue and the dogs were having a grand old time barking and running along the fence with the runners.

Still alone at this point and maintaining position.  Pace is feeling manageable so far and I know once I hit the turnaround, I’ll get a bit of a tailwind back to the start line.  I catch another runner and seem like we will match pace well, but end up yo-yoing back and forth.  Not sure if he intentionally didn’t want me to pass or was unconsciously speeding up every time I tried to go around.

*Park (6:46, 6:59)

I think I left him somewhere in this park section.  It was nice to get back into some shade has the heat was definitely getting noticeable.

*Highway (6:51, 6:46, 6:48)

Back out of the park and down the hill to the highway.  Paces are starting to slip a bit and I start running scenarios in my head trying to determine if it was time to move to my C goal.  I want to get through half at pace and assess at the turnaround as I know there was going to be a decent headwind.  As [I head in to the start line]( https://i.imgur.com/NlI1T6e.jpg)  , I am pretty sure A and B goals are gone.  I know there is no way I’m going to negative split and even maintaining pace is not looking good.

*Half*
Hit the half in 1:29:48, right on target.

*Highway (6:53, 7:29, 7:40)*
First bit of this mile, I am still holding onto hope of maintaining, but the wind has picked up and the sun beating down full force.  At 14, I decide to rein it in and shoot for the 3:10.  I know I might be able to gut most of the rest out to get in the 3:05 range, but didn’t feel like it was worth it to go that deep in the hole.  With an average around 6:45-6:50 for the first half, I figure I need 7:25-ish pace to maintain for a 3:10.  So that’s my new focus.

*Park (7:37, 7:54)*

Back into some shade!  That’s about all I can say was nice in this middle section.  Paces are steadily falling off as the sun beats down and I start wondering if a 3:10 is going to be possible.  Now, the focus is get to each aid station for some water. 

*Turnaround (7:50, 7:52, 7:44)*
I at least know I am not alone as I see the leaders heading back.  The front runners are spread out and the first few are looking strong-ish but the carnage becomes more drastic as places decrease.  Turnaround was a welcome sight because it meant a wind at my back and then just a 10k to finish, I’ve stopped worrying about fueling but just grabbing water to pour on my head.  Helped so much.

*Park (8:06, 8:03)*

This was probably the lowest part of the race.  Wanted to drop so bad, but I knew if I held on, I should have a decent BQ in case this fall didn’t work out.  Also, I didn’t know how I was going to get back to the start and didn’t want to have to wait around long for a ride back.  Time to just grit my teeth and grind the last miles out.

*Highway (7:40, 7:52, 7:25)*
Goal is to hit each aid station for water to pour on my head.  It gives some relief for a bit but then is gone within a couple of minutes.  The last miles were rough mentally and all I wanted to do was be done.  [I feel like I’m slogging my way back to the finish and as usual questioning my life choices.](https://i.imgur.com/QW2LFgZ.jpg)

**Post-race**

Hobbled over to see my wife and the other runners I knew who finished ahead of me.  We all complained and commiserated about the heat and having to back off pace.  Looking at the times later, everyone positive split.  Picked up [my finisher medal]( https://i.imgur.com/pUfKxyK.jpg) and verified my time (which was good for 2nd in my age group).  Quickly headed back to the B&amp;B to get a shower before checkout.  Getting upstairs to our room was not fun, but overall the achiness wasn’t horrible and the shower felt wonderful (Hooray for no chafing!).

The drive back was manageable with only minimal shifting to get comfortable.  We made a pit stop to get Chik-fil-a (sooo good!) and after checking what size nugget meals they have, went for a 12-piece.  They had a 30-piece, but I joked with my wife that that was way too much.  Once I finished the 12-piece, I started regretting not getting the 30.

Got a nice Epsom salt bath once back home and tried not to do too much.  Got in 2 miles the next day with my daughter which helped loosen things up, but was plenty for that day.  Several days of recovery runs and things started feeling normal-ish by the end of that week.

____
**Take-Aways**

Although I didn’t hit my goal, I am not upset about it, just a little disappointed.  I knew weather was going to be a big factor.  I think the training was there and I have gotten my pre-race fueling and race nutrition pretty well nailed down.  Bonking wasn’t an issue here.  It was just sooo hot.  My time gives me a BQ-8:11 which will give me a shot of running in 2022 if for some reason Boston doesn’t happen this fall and I can’t reuse my 2018 time.

I will definitely use Daniels’ again (probably for the next sub-3 attempt), but I do think I need to add a few more miles.  I got off my normal schedule of running early morning before work and ran at lunch.  With the cooler weather that was a bit easier to do at that time of the day and I had a nice flat loop with minimal traffic.  The downside is that I would trim some miles here and there to fit into my lunch hour.  I think I need to make sure to add those back in. I’d also try and get more 18-22 mile long runs as well as get the workout/MLR more in the 12-14 mile range instead of 10-12.  I barely averaged 60 mpw for the cycle whereas my Chicago cycle was an average of 64 mpw.  For Chicago, I also had 6 weeks at 70 mpw or above (peak of 80) while this cycle I had 2 weeks at 70 or above.

It’s all a learning experience and I find new things to adjust each time.


____
**What’s Next?**

I’ve got a HM in a few days (3 weeks after the marathon) and I’m hoping to make use of the marathon fitness to go for a PR.  After that, it’s several weeks of easy running then start a modified Pfitz 18/87 plan to get ready for a 100-miler in October.  Assuming Boston happens, I’ll be using it as a training run so no racing it, just enjoying the atmosphere. 

I still have a good feeling about a sub-3, but I think I need to plan my race choice better.  As much as I did not like training for Chicago over the summer, I think a fall race will be a better choice.  I can handle cold racing much better than hot racing.  I might shoot for Chicago next fall since I had good luck with that course and will give JD another go as it seemed the plan did work well for me.",1621524681

Some experience (decidedly average XC runner in high school ten years ago, half marathon in ~1:30 in college), but I’ve spent the last 5 years or so adding 20 new pounds of muscle and probably another 10 or 15 of “not muscle.” Running is much harder than it used to be. 

In preparation for an Olympic triathlon in 4 months, I’ve been putting in miles. I’m trying to use HR zones to guide me, aiming for most of the mileage to be in Z2. Max HR tested at ~200, so HR zones of &lt;161, &lt;169, &lt;179, &lt;189, &gt;189. Here’s the thing: I go out on a 6 mile run at a 9:30 pace, HR is ends up averaging 175-185 depending on the day. That’s Z3-4 based on the numbers. But it doesn’t feel particularly hard. I could chat, maybe run for 1.5-2 hours. 

But my heart rate is so high (and I’ve checked my monitor)! Am I missing something here? Do I just need to force myself to slow down to keep the HR much lower?

I had a 10k training cycle where I focused on running at the ceiling of my ""Zone 2"" which happened to be right around 154 bpm (pace is irrelevant). In this cycle, I achieved my 10k goal (Break 37 I ran 35:56) and avoided injury.

I then had a second cycle after taking a week off and then 2 down weeks of slow short running. Where I focused on running in the ""no zone""(125-130 bpm) or very low Zone 1 range which was about 130-140 bpm. 

It is important to note, in this second 10k training cycle: I added an extra workout a week at race pace. The first cycle had just one workout a week along with a long run.

Clearly, more time will be needed to recover, but hardly any of my training for the second cycle had run in the 145-154 bpm range. 

Yet, I still hit my goal (34:40 I ran 34:45 and still consider that achieved) and reminded injury-free.

With both these 10k training cycles over - I am wondering, why would I ever run in the 145-154 bpm range? Why do I need to be in zone 2 when I am progressing with most of my running in Zone 1 or in the no-zone?

Currently, I am in a half marathon cycle attempting 1:15:xx and all of my easy runs have been in the low 130s with 2 workouts a week and a hard long run every other week.",1621457543
AdvancedRunning,granleea3,Any other runners here sweat a ton?,"Ever since I can remember, I have sweat A LOT. It never fails when it is warm out, that I look like I just jumped in a pool and got out. My shoes will be so soaked that they squish after a certain point.

AdvancedRunning,481562342,Where to Start with Marathon Training,"Hi r/AdvancedRunning. I’m an avid runner (23M) looking to start serious marathon training. I ran in high school (was a ~17:30 5k guy) and have done a couple marathons, but never took training seriously given how busy (and lazy) I was when I ran them in college. I did 3:30 about three years ago with no real training plan, about 3-4 runs per week, a longest run of 18 mi. I love to run and have been made it part of my daily routine again during covid (~25 MPW with 4 or 5 runs a week). My goals are to become more committed and sign up for a race in the early spring of 2022 now that the world is getting back to normal. My main constraint with training is that I work a job that doesn’t allow for a ton of free time during the week.

A couple questions for anyone who might have a similar backstory or knows anything about getting into serious marathon training:

(1) How do you recommend making the jump from casual runner (25 MPW) to serious marathoner (60+ MPW)? 

(2) How important are different types of workouts in aiming for a marathon time of, say, 3:15? (I usually just run at like 7-7:20 pace regardless of distance and haven’t done tempo or interval work since HS) What about strength training?

(3) For folks who have long working hours during the week (8:30a-7:30p is probably my average), has marathon training added to your stress levels? Do you find yourself sacrificing sleep to get training runs in? If you’ve had to make any trade offs involving your running goals, leisure time, and professional goals, how have you navigated that?

Thanks in advance! I’ve enjoyed skimming through posts here and will defintiely use this forum to learn more as I start to get more serious about training.",1621446910
AdvancedRunning,JamesFattyHarden,HR training in the summer,"Hey folks, 

I know that summer heat makes running slower. **Do those of you who normally train by HR switch to training by pace in the humid months or do you drop speed to keep your HR down where you usually train at during most of the year?** 

For example, from Oct-April I easily held 150-153bpm for my easy runs at 7:40/mile to as low as 7:20/mile pace on good days. Now, dew points are no longer below 30 and are pushing into the 50s and I can feel it. I'm now running those same paces at closer to 157-160bpm. 

For reference, Pfitz has my general aerobic at 140bpm to 158bpm. I always use a chest strap for every run. I'm not sure if I should hold my usual paces or my usual HR over the next 3-4 months.",1621445679

AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Workout of the Week - The Michigan,"I thought I would revive a past weekly post of the sub! 

_____________

Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent  specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas:

* A new workout
* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is The Michigan**.

*History*

Created in the 70s by Ron Warhurst for his University of Michigan cross country team. While the workout retains its original locational name it has since spread to become a staple at numerous other schools. The workout was designed to touch on all of the different systems and simulate the changing paces of a race. 

*What* 

* warmup inc. strides
* 1 mile on the track at 10k race pace
* Recover jog 3 min to a section of road
* 1 mile on the road at tempo pace
* Recover jog 3 min back to track
* Run 1200m on track at 10k pace
* Recover jog 3 min back to a section of road
* 1 mile on the road at tempo pace
* Recover jog 3 min back to track
* Run 800m on track at 5k pace
* Recover jog 3 min back to a section of road
* 1 mile on the road at tempo pace
* Recover jog 3 min back to track
* Run 400m on track at faster than 5k pace (simulate the final kick of a race)
* cooldown/collapse

*How*

Survive. 

*When*

This is a tough workout, so you don't want to be doing this too often. It was designed for the 8-10k cross country season, so if you are training for anything around that range (5k-half) it will most likely work for you. You definitely don't want to be doing this one during a taper period.

*Anyone use this one and what have been your experiences?*",1621432708
AdvancedRunning,LTK333,Question about HRs,"Hi all,

Newly passionate (&lt;9 mths) runner - Started during COVID and have now a new found love.

I have 2 x goals for this year 2021, 1. A 3.30 marathon, 2. A sub 19m 5000m.

I am a mid 30's male, rather heavy (210lbs), and the challenge I have is I find myself maxing out HR / mental strength at roughly 170-172 bpm. 

At this rate, I feel totally exhausted - like my body is disconnecting with my head, and eventually give up.

All standard measurements suggest my HR max should be 185-195, so I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong. 

Nb. The harder I train, the more VO2 work I do, my pace gets faster relative to HR expenditure, but still find my top limit at that early 170 mark.

SO - Is it 1. Mentally weak, 2. Need a proper HR max test, 3. Something I'm doing wrong? 

Thanks",1621429499

I don't mean this question--crowing about all these options--to be obnoxious as I realize I was really fortunate with Boston given the change in field size. 

My specific situation is this:  I've never done Boston or Berlin but have run (with mixed results, 3:24 PR) NYC a few times.  Over the past couple years I've markedly improved my time in the HM (from 1:31 to 1:24) and really want to see what I've got on a fast course like Berlin.  On the other hand, Boston is iconic and it would be the first time for me.  NYC is familiar but I live in NYC and participating in the marathon is so much fun, and feels almost obligatory for serious runners here.   I'm a Masters runner, by the way, so the cutoff for Boston was not as much of a stretch as for those 18-45.  I could probably qualify again.   (I'm also thinking about doing two of these races, despite the close dates).

AdvancedRunning,MyFastPentium4,How to manually create structured workouts with Garmin 945 and Stryd pod for free? (And how to improve my marathon time?),"Hi everyone!   


**TL;DR: What is the best/easiest way to manually create structured workouts that are based on CP/FTP zones? I have a Garmin 945 and a Stryd 'wind' power pod.**

Last year, I got a Stryd power meter pod, purchased a power training plan and did a 4 month marathon training block. I improved my time by 14% in those 4 months (obviously some of that is just from the training block, but I do give plenty of credit to Stryd.

Well, they recently created a membership service that you have to pay for to access advanced features. As far as I can tell, without paying, I cannot manually build my own workouts in Stryd's PowerCenter platform.

I looked into the Garmin Connect platform, and while I can create Structured Workouts, I do not see an option to base them off of POWER zones, just Pace or HR.

One option would be to buy a plan that has different workouts in it, but from my past experience with running, plus having gone through the marathon block, I feel good about creating my own workouts, especially things like intervals and tempo type workouts. I just want to create the workout in a structured way, with a countdown timer and power zone displayed on my watch, rather than monitoring my stats using a Garmin 'Run' activity profile and manually pressing the lap button.

&amp;#x200B;

Second question: I want to manually create workouts that are similar to the marathon training plan, but are a bit shorter and faster. I'm thinking if I train for a 10k, I might be able to improve my speed and stamina enough to bring down my marathon time to hit my ultimate goal. Is this a good idea (training for 3-4 months on a 10k plan before launching into my marathon block again.)?  


Thank you!",1621363867
AdvancedRunning,jcdavis1,11 weeks out from starting 18/70 - What should I be doing?,"At the risk of being yet another ""rate my chances of going sub-3"" post - I'm currently planning on doing CIM with an 18/70 plan, which would mean an August 2nd start. This will be my first full, and of course the dream is 2:59:59.

1. In terms of mileage/volume, I'm not particularly concerned. I ran 53 miles with 2 workouts (4 mile tempo and 10x400) last week and that felt pretty comfortable. Last year I got as high as back to back 60 mile weeks (though that was 7 days of running) without issue. The only thing that seems somewhat scary in the first few weeks is the 17 with 8@MP LR.
2. In terms of sheer fitness to have a chance at 2:59, I'm pretty concerned. My last ""race"" was a 5k TT around a year ago where I ran 18:50, but I have not kept up fitness since then (plenty of base mileage, but fewer &amp; lower intensity workouts). I'll probably do a TT in the next month or so, but If I had to guess I would say I'm in 19:15-19:30ish 5k shape.

Which leads to the question - what should I be doing leading up to the 8/2 start? Given my fitness concerns, I've been trying to do 2 workouts/week (generally 1 threshold + 1 VO2) plus the usual long run, with the goal of 50-55 miles in general, probably with a 1 or 2 week drawdown/taper before starting. Curious if people have thoughts/suggestions?",1621360747
AdvancedRunning,ProfEweagey,Time-until-bonk,"Seems like conventional wisdom is that your body has about enough glycogen to support about 2 hours of moderate to intense activity without refueling. After that your metabolism prioritizes fat burning, and it's in the transition time that you can hit that temporary wall as your body adjusts.

On my Sunday long run I ran 27 miles in 2hr54min. I felt progressively better and better (closed in 24 flat for the last 4) without experiencing any symptoms of carb-depletion. I ran in the morning and didn't eat/drink anything before or during the run. My long runs are typically \~2-2.5 hours and I never fuel before/during.

I'm curious about if anyone has thoughts on that time-until-bonk metric. Did I just smoothly transition to fat-burning and skip the bonk phase? Had I not yet reached that transition point? Am I missing something else here?",1621353486

# Goals

# Backstory

**Running Background**

I picked up distance running in my adult life. My first ever race was a half-marathon where I proudly finished in 1:52--this was back in 2012 and smashed my 2hr goal. Over the years I kept running, although I didn't (and actually still don't) race too often but I saw my times drop down when I did. I ran a 1:29 half in 2016 (although I later found out the course was short by maybe 0.2mi and uncertified, so...). 

After that I took about two years kinda ""off"" of running where I ran at most every other day after that half-marathon due to grad school, and it was often just short 4-5 milers. I basically didn't go on a single long run during that time. I paid the price when I came back to running after graduating...I ran a disappointing (to me) HM of 1:34 in March of 2019, the first time I didn't PR in a race.

Marathon-wise, this race was my fourth. Progression went from:

* 2014: 3:48 at Marine Corps
* 2015: 3:29 at Marine Corps
* 2019: 3:11 at CIM  (because those 1:34 HMs earlier in the year really got me motivated to train proper). 

Essentially doing anything under 3:01 would have meant for my third double-digit marathon PR in a row.  

My other PRs are 39:31 for the 10k (set in a tune-up for CIM in 2019) and 1:25:39 for the half (HM was via GPS, so likely longer on an actual course).

**Race Training**

I used a modified version of Pfitz 18/70 to become 15/70. It was my second time doing 18/70 but the first time did not result in an actual race since I did it last summer--just a HM time trial (the PR I had above). For the modifications, I took out two of the race prep weeks and one of the initial lactate threshold weeks. 

I wanted to do 18/70 for a specific race elsewhere, but the race eventually got cancelled for a virtual options. As I had already started my plan, I started seeking high and low for other courses within driving distance...but there really weren't much available. Eventually I found a small marathon that was somehow even able to take place in 2020. Given that, it felt reassuring that it would happen, and I decided to sign up.

Here were some of the key workouts, both successes and failures:

* 16mi w/ 8 @ MP - hit 6:48/mi on rolling hills, good confidence booster for the second week of training
* 18mi w/ 10 @ MP - hit 6:50/mi on the MP portion, very tough effort, out of gas at end
* 10mi w/ 6 @ Tempo - 6:42/mi for the tempo portion, struggled hard :( Life had some particularly stressful occurrences that week, leading to a few weeks of not hitting paces well
* Tune up half - ran with barely a mini taper 8 weeks out, hit 1:26:42, making sub-3 feel really unsure. Still had stressors and bad sleep...
* 12mi w/ 7 @ Tempo - 6:33/mi - this was two weeks after my tune up half so it made me think my half time was just a bad day. I finished strong on this tempo without pushing it.
* 18mi w/ 14 @ MP - hit 6:49/mi on the MP portion, tough but manageable effort, huge confidence booster
* 5mi TTs  -  6:21/mi was my best, but I also know my TTs for these suck compare to real race times and previous times I've had comparison points. These end up usually being 15 seconds slower than my 10k pace would be in a race, so it didn't mess with me too much.

Besides the stressful life weeks, training went well and I wasn't injured and able to hit my target paces.  I typically did long runs fasted. Also, I didn't discover foam rolling until 8 weeks to go and boy did that make a difference.

I generally ran long runs and medium long runs at 7:50/mi average (whittling down to 7:25 towards the end), tempos at 6:30-6:35/mi, VO2 at 5:50/mi, and Recovery 9:00/mi+. Not exactly groundbreaking speed for a sub-3. 

(I knew I was right on the bubble.)

# Enough backstory...day of race

**Pre-Race**

I woke up at 3:30 for the 6:00 am start. Well, I actually woke up at 1:30, and then 2:30, and then just laid in bed. My mouth was dry when waking, which wasn't good. I chugged some waters and ate some light carbs and two bananas. Still drinking water. Mouth still dry....

My guess because it was the elevation, which I was a little worried about--it was at 2000ft. I know that isn't exactly Everest by any means, but what probably intimidated me more was after reading Alex Hutchinson's Endure where he talks about running in Canberra, Australia -- incidentally at the same elevation -- and how it lead to some disappointing race times, including his, and with some scientific backing that even ""low altitude"" still affects distance runs. Since I trained at sea level, there wasn't much I could do to counter this.

I got to the race at 5:15am for the 6:00am start. Immediately went to the bathroom and was...uh, conclusively hydrated, perhaps too much. Mouth still somewhat dry. WTF. Nervousness? I relax back in the car, then use the bathroom again 15 minutes later for the last time. I put on my Next %s for the first time in 15 months. Time to rock and I head towards the start.

Somehow, 5 minutes before the race, my core starts to feel tight. Like it's almost cramping tight. WTF again. I haven't had core issues during any of training, so it feels foreign...but there's nothing to do about it now.

**Mile 0-6**

My race strategy was to average the first half at 6:55/mi pace and then negative split in the 2nd half. I tried to keep pace focused on the current mile split, not average, even went to change my Garmin watch screen to not show average pace on one of the data screens so that I wouldn’t get discouraged. (and thus even breaking the rule of ""nothing new on race day"").

The race took place on a running/bike trail, with the start/finish located in a parking lot to enter the main trail. There were marathon, half, and 5k events, with the marathon starting the earliest. It was a quasi loop/out-and-back — we would start going east, then hairpin turn, then west all the way until hair pinning east again back to the finish line. To my satisfaction, the group of runners that started at the 6AM start were largely seemingly going for around sub-3. We trod together, spaced apart. It's good because my other marathons were pretty big ones, so having people to run with makes it feel a lot easier.

The miles are feeling effortless and my breathing feels good. However, my core still feels tight. It’s the slightest of inclines gradual to mile 8, so I just try to keep mentally blank. I check my heart rate and it's right where I should be, and then I try to just not look at my watch to overthink it if it skips over just a bit. I kinda realize I’m still thinking too much at Mile 4…got a long way to go. I take my first Gel at Mile 5. 

Due to COVID precautions, aid stations were staffed with 20oz bottles of water on tables. In the first aid station, I grabbed a water bottle and tried to run holding onto it, but it was honestly just cumbersome to hold. It’s a dissonant decision to toss the rest of the water bottle alongside the trail, especially since the trail isn’t consistent with trash cans.

*Splits:* 

*6:56, 6:54, 6:54, 6:54, 6:57, 6:58*

**Mile 6-10**

These miles were a bit more exposed and although the rest of the course was neutral to wind, the headwind/tailwind, even if slight, felt pronounced. I start to run more with a woman, who I assume is also going sub-3. This helps so much — we can just run side by side and I don’t have to think about it as much. After a couple of miles we finally break the ice and announce our goals--we both are trying to break 3--and she even offers to share her water. I can tell she seems to be running a smart race strategy. That said, I’m not terribly chatty, so we just carry on, silent yet focused. There are a couple of faster-paced miles here, mostly due to the very slight tailwind (maybe if even just 5mph) and some downhill. I tell myself to hold back a little bit still, as my pace cracks 6:30 at points and I force myself to reign it back. 

Oh, and the damn core is still tight. I guess it's not gonna let up today.

*Splits:*

*6:52, 6:55, 6:44, 6:52, 6:43*

**Mile 10-14**

After Mile 10, we start to see the half marathon racers start to enter the picture. It’s starting to feel like a normal race! Even though they are going the other way, it still provides god energy. I’m relieved to be close to the halfway point, where I can actually sorta start to turn my brain “on”. Not only that, but I’m feeling relatively good and my heart rate, which was weirdly high on the taper, shows that I’m not working too hard yet. 

I notice my tangent running is good. I’m only .01 to .02 over the marked distance on the course. Not every runner in front of me was taking the tangents...my pace quickens over this period and the woman I was running with is still with me but just a few strides back.

These miles felt good. I don’t feel too tired, but at 13.1 I’m not as fresh was I was the last time I ran a marathon at CIM.

*Splits:*

*6:43, 6:47, 6:47*

**Mile 14 - 16**

More and more runners enter the cut from the shorter distance races, and it provides good energy, even if they are going the other way. My pace quickens again.At mile 16 I know I’ll see my fiancee and then it’s down to single digit miles left from there.

What is reassuring to myself is that with less than 14 miles left, I tell myself that I can do it based on Pfitz’s 18 w/ 14MP and my heart rate being less than it was when I did the MP portion of that workout. I start to get more confidence. I see my fiancee at Mille 16 as promised…and now we are off to the marathon-only portion of the race.

*Splits:* 

*6:49, 6:50, 6:49*

**Mile 16-20**

Damn, it’s way quieter. After mile 16, there are no half runners, no 5k runners...just marathoners, and there's only about 12 people in front of me, but not visible. And there’s…too many downhills. It’s a gradual descent from mile 10 to 20; scary enough that I worry about my quads (even though I’m generally a good downhill runner) and more scary in that I know what goes down must come back up in an an out-and-back course. The miles that are uphill are also the last ones. It’s also getting sunnier and more exposed. Weather forecast had the temps going up to 66F towards the end of the race — not brutal but not the most ideal. Thankfully dew point and humidity were low. 

Now is the time to focus. I tell myself to focus on just getting to 20 and decide whether or not to make a move from there. Miles 16-18 go by somewhat quick but 18-20 feel like they drag on. One suboptimal thing that happened is that the aid station at Mile 17.75 I missed my bottle completely. I wish the volunteers would have spaced the bottles further apart and made them easier to grab versus having them densely grouped together on the inside on the table. “Ooh, that sucks…” says a volunteer…she’s right. I’m getting a bit thirstier but I trod on, acknowledging it’s too late. I can't get mad at the volunteers, but I hope it wasn't a terrible gaffe. That said, it is still not a huge breaker as I ran all of my training runs without water, giving me some reassurance I can do this.

A downhill at Mile 20 is especially fast, and I pass another runner at this point.

*Splits:* 

*6:49, 6:48, 6:47, 6:47, 6:37* 

**Miles 20-25**

What worries me is that I don’t see any runners on their way back yet. Maybe we’re all around the same pace, but also it means the turnaround point feels far. Finally, I ultimately turnaround around near a residential neighborhood at Mile 21. Shortly after the hairpin I see the woman I ran with earlier, still just a few strides back. I high five her, say “Let’s do this”, and continue on. I manage to successfully grab water at the aid station this time...I chug a bit, then pour the rest over my head.

But damn, my legs are starting to get tired. And now, on top of my perpetually tight core, my back is starting to get tighter too. I force myself to  check my form and relax and take deeper breaths. It helps and I don't lock up as much. As I pass Mile 22, I start to feel it. I finally see my overall pace and it’s at 6:50. My tangent running has declined a bit and I’m now up to 0.05mi long. Crowd support is diminished. It’s just me, the sun, the rolling hills, and my mental game. As I climb back the hills, I see my instantaneous pace slip to 7:30…@#$%. Is this it? Do I have to find another race months from now and train all over again?

I stop waving to runners as they passed. I’m focused solely on gritting through it. The ones I do pass I say the same thing: ""Let's do this"". They are all still encouraging. I also miss the damn water bottle again at Mile 24.25 (the same aid station as from 17.75). Great. But it's ok...just 2mi left. 

*Splits:* 

*6:47, 6:38, 6:54, 6:52, 6:40 (premature kick…)*

**To the finish…**

After mile 25, I feel “there”. I realize my pace could slip if it wanted to and I could still hit sub-3. Heck, I think I’m on pace for a 2:58. But then…wait. I’m not. As I hit 26 and have .31 left due to decreased focus on tangents…it’s gonna be a little close. I start to push harder, but I’m not getting any faster. I usually have a strong kick but it’s not there. A runner I passed just a mile ago outkicks me to the finish. Damn. But…I’m…almost…there…

# DONE. 2:59:24. 

*Splits:* 

*6:50, final 0.3 was 6:41/mi.*

Final splits overall: [Strava Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/2ylOTeI.jpg). My HR ranges looked good and progressed naturally, so I felt as if I paced the race well. It was the slightest of negative splits; looks like I ran approx 1:29:55 for the half mark.

# Post-race

I caught my breath, embraced my fiancee, walked around, revelled in the post-race camaraderie. I missed that aspect. Everyone in the race was super positive and friendly. It felt nice to be back in somewhat normalcy. I chugged a bunch of chocolate milk I brought to the race as well as a delightfully half-frozen lemon-lime Gatorade. I babbled delusionally about my feelings on the race and the triumph.

And boy, I'm sore. Surprisingly, what is most sore is my core, upper back (running too tense at the end?), and my left mid-foot. I don't think it's a stress fracture (famous last words?) but maybe just an inflamed tendon. I can walk OK--uphills are fine--but flexing my foot feels funny. I'm probably going to take a week off and just eat guiltlessly while I'm still on vacation.

Running wise, I'm tempted to run another full before Boston registration to try and build some buffer for 2022 but I don't think I have enough time to really do it and it's an unclear target. After focusing so much on the marathon over the past couple years, I'm tempted to spend some time focused on something like a 10k to ramp up my speed. My LT paces haven't progressed nearly as much as my marathon efforts have and I'd love to make faster paces seem less daunting. At the very least, I'm going to assume I've not yet plateaued in training...maybe I will join a local club and try something new outside of my typical Pfitz routines. Sub-3 was something I didn't think was possible and didn't have confidence for until that big PR I had at CIM. Consistency was what made the difference for me...might be the last double digit marathon PR but I think I still have some more room to grow!",1621348832
AdvancedRunning,sverzijl,Recovery Drink Carbs Calculation,"I've been doing a bit of reading on post-recovery drinks and I've seen a lot of articles citing 1 to 1.5 g carb per 1 kg body weight per hour of exercise (1-1.5g/kg/h). 

I was just wondering if there is a calculation based on calories burnt as I imagine the amount of carbohydrate required is based on how much physical exercise you've done and not necessarily time.

I thought maybe it's basically replacing the amount of glycogen you consumed in your exercise. Based on a 1 hour run at 11.3 km/h (7 mph) you burn an estimate 778 cal if you weigh 70 kg. I've seen sites state we consume 65% of calories in the form of carbohydrates. That would be 505 calories worth of carbs or 126g. That equates to 1.8 g/kg/h or 0.23 g/kg/100 cal. This is higher than the upper end, but I guess within 20% and closer if you take 65% to be too high. 

Just wondering if that is the basis of the 1-1.5g/kg/h or if there is more to it?",1621343508

I’ve been dealing with gait problems for the past year (caused some stress fractures in my foot) and after doing a stride analysis with my PT today, have finally narrowed it done to my left leg having a cross over. By this I mean that with every step, my left leg curves into the mid line, while my right is going straight. Originally, my PT had thought this was due to hip and glute weakness that was just causing a knee valgus. However, I have been working on strength and no longer have the valgus, but still my left leg is crossing over.

I have a pretty convenient gradual climb (400 ft over 3 miles) near me and I'm wondering if it makes sense to do that run on an easy or recovery day. My gut is telling me that this doesn't make sense for a recovery day, since it is added stress and the whole point of recovery days is to reduce the amount of stress on the body, but what about a general aerobic day (I think this is also sometimes referred to as easy or steady, depending on the program)?",1621310096

AdvancedRunning,jchrysostom,Run With Hal app 5k training plan - paces seem weird?,"Background: 38/m, 17:32 5K PR back when I was racing regularly, ran 20-25mpw at the time of the PR. I haven’t raced or done speed training regularly in 5-6 years; I have been running 15-20mpw consistently with some random track workouts and tempo stuff thrown in here and there. Did a 19:20 5k in March of last year without much structured training. 

I’m trying to embrace the idea of doing easy runs at a pace that’s, well, really easy. Conversational pace, “Kenyan shuffle”, whatever. I’m getting older, stuff hurts more than it used to, and this seems to be helping. It’s hard to find consistency in the idea of HR zones, but I generally aim for 130ish which puts me between an 8:30 and 9:00 pace depending on temp / humidity / sleep / breakfast. 

I downloaded the Run With Hal app to follow the Intermediate 5K training plan. It asked for my goal time (18:38, maybe slightly optimistic but not unreasonable) and my easy run pace (8:45 based on that 130ish HR effort). 

What I’m noticing is that the training paces seem way off. It’s telling me to do a “fast” run at 8:00/mi in a few days. There’s also a “400m at 5k pace” speed workout which has me doing 400’s at a 7:00ish pace, and a “tempo” day at 7:10-8:00 pace. These are all much slower than I would expect those workouts to be. 

What gives? Does the app calculate your paces based on the “easy” pace rather than the goal time? I can go do some 400’s at 7:00/mi, that just seems slow for speed work. 

Am I going too easy on the easy days? Or is Hal not on board with running slow?",1621286292

### Training
I’m a 21M college student (soon-to-be graduate) and have run for my school’s DIII cross country and track team for the last 3 years. 
This was my longest training block by far, with 25 weeks of running (from my time off after last season until race day). I loosely followed Jack Daniels 18-week 2Q training program, with some gentle base-building beforehand since I can be prone to injury from jumping into things too quickly. Since this was my first time racing anything longer than an 8k, I didn’t have much to go off of as far as setting goals - but based on Daniels’ calculations, 2:48 should have been doable so I trained with a 6:25 M pace. Some days that felt totally doable, some days it really didn’t. My peak mileage was 70 miles, which I held for 5 or 6 weeks with one recovery week at about 80% of that. 
If I were to change anything looking back, I probably would have shortened the 18-week plan down to 14 or so, since I felt really fit around that time and was starting to feel a little overcooked by the end. 

### Pre-race
I woke up at about 1 am on race day to my worst nightmare - feeling sick with a sore throat and nausea. Being fully vaccinated and having a normal temperature relieved the COVID stress, but I was still pretty anxious about putting my body through a marathon while it was battling an infection. The few bites of English muffin I had for breakfast ended up in the toilet about 30 minutes before race start. After some mental torment, I decided to take some tums, jog to the starting line and give it my all anyways. 15 minutes before the gun, I took a gel that sat pretty well. 

### Race
Since I wasn’t feeling 100%, I decided to start out a bit more conservative than I had planned. Something like 6:35-6:40s, until I got to the turn around point at 8 miles and the course started having a slight downhill. Early miles felt really great, and I decided to push towards my goal pace after mile 8. I continued to feel great up through mile 18 or so, and then I had to start focusing to maintain pace. Come mile 24, the nausea returned and I violently ejected some water and Gu on the side of the trail, which slowed that mile down quite a bit. Rode the struggle bus in for the last few miles as fast as I could manage, got passed by a couple folks but finished with a time I was totally thrilled with. 

### Post-race
Threw up some more and laid in the grass for a few minutes before heading to the showers and going out for brunch with some friends. 
Crossing my fingers that Boston 2022’s qualifying cutoff will be more forgiving than this years, and that will hopefully be my next race! I’ll definitely focus on training my stomach a bit more next time, and would love any tips  anyone might have for staving off the post-mile 20 nausea.

AdvancedRunning,NoRepro,Downhill running form,"Hi all- I'm looking forward to my first race - a Half Marathon in October, and there's a pretty long section with a mild downhill.  Hoping for sub 1:40, which might be a little optimistic but not out of reach (recently ran an un-tapered 47:34 10K).  I'm 43M, 6', 180 lbs, and only been running seriously since December (although I've always been pretty athletic).  I currently run about 30 mpw, 5 days a week, with weights on the off days.  I tend to have ankle/achilles soreness, although that has improved over the last 6 months of running as I've gotten stronger.

Anyways, my question is about downhill running form, which I've seen disagreement on when researching online.  I'm talking about mild to moderate downhill, not so steep that I can't keep control of myself.

At first, I tried increasing cadence, but that actually led to a slower downhill and more perceived effort and strain on my ankles.  These days I've found that significantly increasing stride length feels right, which moves me from a mid foot strike to a heel strike allows me to open things up, let gravity do most of the work, and vary my form (which I feel like saves me in flat or uphill sections).  I have a pretty fast turnover, I typically run at 180 spm, and sometimes higher if I'm really booking it, all to make up for having a Michael Phelps-like torso and little stubby hobbit legs.

Is the advice to use a shorter cadence and stick with a mid foot strike on downhills strictly to avoid injury or does it really save your legs from immediate exhaustion?  When I've done this is feels particularly hard on my ankles, which are already my weak point.  Even though I switch to a heel strike in my downhills I don't feel like I spend a lot of effort braking, but maybe I am and I just don't realize it.  Plus my knees and hips are plenty strong in comparison to my ankles.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",1621270628
AdvancedRunning,mark--dynamicbalance,The Fundamentals of Clean Gait &amp; Why Poor Gait Causes Pain.,"Hey there, I’m Mark St. Peter, I’ve been a Physiotherapist for 30 years in San Francisco. I have worked with many runners over the years. I have helped young runners overcome ankle issues, I have helped middle-aged runners overcome knee issues, I have helped folks with artificial joints run again, I have helped older people in their 60s who haven't run for 20 years run again. In addition I currently coach multiple runners ranging from 5k speedsters to centurion ultramarathoners. If you would like to learn more about me you can go to my website at [dynamicbalance.com](https://dynamicbalance.com/).

If you have no pre-existing trauma or pathologies, no previous injuries, or other known limitations, the pain related to your running can quite likely be eliminated by adjusting your gait to a flowing more neutral stride.

The inescapable reality of running is: It is an intense high volume, repetitive motion. In running, there is a tremendous impact with every stride. It's one's ability to maintain foundation strength and control these forces that prevent this impact from causing damage (especially your ability to control your pelvic tilt and neck posture). Every flaw in your biomechanical system will influence the pattern of how you run. Your psychology will influence the pattern in which you run. Your mood at the moment will influence the pattern in which you run. Your quirks and qualms and need to listen to music also influence the pattern in which you run.

Anyways on to the good stuff. **Here are the key fundamentals of clean gait which you should be aware of.**

* 1. Vertical displacement: Do not bounce up and down. All momentum should be transferred forward not into the ground. When you bounce up and down you are slowing yourself down and putting unnecessary stress on the body. 

* 2. Lateral displacement: Don’t sway side to side. See explanation if momentum is being transferred to the sides it’s putting unnecessary stress on your stabilizing muscles.

* 3. Deflection of body parts: Minimize compression of body parts against one another. If your head jutts forward while you are running you are compressing the muscles of the neck. If your pelvis jutts forward you are compressing the spine. You can solve this by building foundation strength to control your core.

* 4. Synchronization: The arms, legs, and cadence work together to keep momentum flowing. Keep them moving in unison. 

* 5. Linearity: All momentum should be channel straight ahead.

Piece of advice: don't run with an iPod/phone in your hand (or anything else)! If you are going to carry music while running, it should be at the center of your body, firmly fixed. Your abdomen, chest, low back. Not in your hand or even your side pocket. This creates a host of problems you don't want.

If you want to improve your foundational strength I recommend watching these 2 videos. I give these 2 exercises  to every single person who comes into my clinic  (or variations of them). They are the starting point for building a strong foundation and if you master both these exercises you’ll take the first step to running pain free.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JViY56JPk0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHo4acbC30g

Lastly, I’ve recently started working with clients online and I’d like to get more educational gait media for them. With that in mind **I’ll analyze the gaits of 5 redditors who post videos of their gait in the this thread.** This is the best way I can help you understand the flaws in your gait and how to improve it.

Gait video instructions:

Walk/Run directly towards the camera then once you reach the camera turn around and walk back the same way. Once you reach your starting point turn 90 degrees and Walk/Run to the edge of the camera frame then turn around and walk to the other edge of the camera frame.

I recommend doing at least 2 repetitions of this so I have more material to analyze.

The goal is to have footage of you walking/running from the side and front.

Other requirements:
* The camera should be stationary and fixed.
* The camera should be at chest height.
* Make sure the camera is 
* Make sure the space is large enough to where you are taking full normal strides.
* Don’t go out of your way to look at the camera
* For convenience purposes make sure the video is in one file.

If you do not post in this format I will not be able to review your gait.",1621266893

AdvancedRunning,cyber846,Rate my sub 3 plan,"I've got some great advice and well-needed tough love from this sub since joining it, so I'd really appreciate any thoughts on this plan. Thanks in advance!  


I am 23M, 75kg (\~165lbs). Most recent PB is a 37:52 tune up 10k two days ago, and I'm targeting a sub 1:25 half marathon in 12 days, which I'm pretty confident I'll achieve based on how my training has been going.  


I'm coming to the end of the Pfitz 12/63 half marathon training plan, at the end of which I'll have 19 weeks until Manchester marathon in October, where my goal is to run sub 3. Going into this training block, my plan was to take a week to recover, before going into the Pfitz 18/70 marathon plan. However, I'm now reconsidering that plan, for a few reasons.

* I could stand to lose another 10lbs or so (still got a bit of fat on me, I'm not particularly lean), but I find this difficult when doing hard training.
* I've been roped into a 50k ultra two weeks after the half marathon. I'll be running it with someone significantly slower than me, but still, it's an ultra, and I don't think it's a great idea to drop back into full training two days later.
* On a separate note, I found the peak mileage very manageable in 12/63, going a bit beyond it in some peak weeks. I think I might be able to manage a bit more.

The biggest point here is the first one; I've gained a lot of speed from losing weight in the past, and whilst there's of course a limit to the benefits, I don't think I'm at that point yet. In my mind, being 10lbs lighter could be a bit of a game changer and strongly boost my chances of hitting sub 3 in October.

With this in mind, I'm considering doing Pfitz 12/85, leaving 7 weeks between the half marathon and starting the plan. I would use this time to lose weight and ramp up my mileage to prepare for the plan, running easy only so that I can handle a calorie deficit and the increased mileage. I'd obviously take some time to recover after the half, and after the ultra as well.

The main questions I have are:

1. Am I pushing mileage up too quickly by attempting 12/85 over 12/70?
2. Would more time spent doing focussed marathon training be more effective than losing weight?

Any thoughts appreciated whether or not they relate to these two questions.",1621253328

I was scheduled to do my marathon on 9th May but due to 50kph winds I postponed a week.

I made my attempt yesterday; it rained the entire run, and wind was 20-30kph.  I got to 30km and on a bit of an uphill climb, I got really bad cramp in my hamstring and my calf at same time.  Up until then, I was comfortable going along at target pace.  After, my pace dropped by 1min/km and I couldn’t pick it up.  I managed to get to 35km and could go no further.

I just ran at a pace where my breathing was always comfortably manageable and if I were to increase my pace just a bit I'd find my breathing become a bit more laboured. This was how I knew I was just at the top of my aerobic zone. Fast forward to today, I'm running faster at this perceived effort than I have in the past. Looking at previous years I'd probably be running at 4:45-4:50/km, now I'm running at about 4:30-4:35/km. This is with no increase in weekly/annual mileage. In previous years I would be following something like the maffetone approach but eventually my running just stagnated following that approach so I scrapped that idea.

I put my heart rate monitor back on for some long runs the past few weeks and my HR is probably around 80-85% of my max (rough guess). This to me is well above what I thought a zone 2 type run should be. Running at a pace where my HR would be 70-75% of my max would be so incredibly slow I'd rather die. My question is, should I slow things down a bit even though I feel comfortable running 25-30km at this HR and RPE as explained above? Does anyone else have experience with what feels like a zone 2 run coming out to a higher HR than expected?

Additional background: 30 years old. I'm a triathlete, mostly focusing on half distance and full distance Ironman events. Can't swim right now so biking and running about 9 hours a week total. Running mileage is about 50km a week.",1621210317
AdvancedRunning,Brother_Tamas,"Switching to mid distance to sprints for state, help?","Hey,
So i’m in an interesting situation...  For context, I’m a mid distance runner with my best times in the 1600 meters. For our region meet, we needed another guy for a 4x4. I go to a small private school, so depth is an issue. We brought up an 8th grader and we both ran in a 4x4 the week before regions. I was faster, so I got the spot. Come time for regions, we get 3rd with a decent time. (top 2 qualify from 3 regions, best 2 other times qualify from any region.) We end up snatching up the last spot. I also missed qualifying for my other 3 main races getting 3rd 3rd and 4th :(. So i’m only running the 4x4 at state. 

My question is should I maintain a certain amount of volume while training for the 4x4, or am I just wasting my time? I am going to be working with the 400m guys and doing their workouts. Previously, I ran right around 35mpw, getting speed work in 2-3 times a week, depending on meet schedule.

AdvancedRunning,dilchooss,I’ll take injured-plagued year for $200,"TLDR: 2020 was for smashing PRs. Came into 2021 with a nagging hamstring that hasn’t left. Made me utterly frustrated until I accepted it will be a slow year and embraced these low-HR runs. I now enjoy these runs the most.

Wanted to share a tidbit for those dealing with some injuries or frustrations. 

Was super stoked with my 2020 running regimen and races. I’m just a casual runner so the times for 5k-21k are obviously relative. 

Had ambitious goals heading into 2021 but kept getting injured left and right. 

It made me super frustrated and in bad moods for the rest of the day (my gf can attest to that) cause I couldn’t complete my 6x800m intervals or whatever. 

I’ve seen two PT’s and tried various different exercises. They help but haven’t felt close to 100% yet. 

At this point, I’ve accepted that 2021 will be a year of slow easy runs, enjoying the view and listening to whatever music I’m in the mood for! 

As I’ve I finally embraced this, it has made me enjoy the runs much more than trying to shave a few seconds off my PR’s.

Anyways - hope the admins let the post stay and that it helps those dealing with similar situations!",1621189144

Training
M/30/50km per week.

I am a solid middle of the pack runner (back of the pack in the more popular races) and started running about 18 months ago because my boss forced me to sign up for a 10k. I finished said 10k in around 56 minutes in August 2019 with about a month of preparation and nearly died, but kind of started liking running so started just doing a lot of zone 2 running in the next 6 months. I started reading a lot in these subs which helped massively.

Late last year I signed up with a coach to get me to a decent half marathon target. Based on a more recent 10k time of about 49:50, the coach at a target of 1:48 for my half and I signed up for the SMH half, and thus training began in January. 

I saw a lot of improvement as he kept mileage to around 50km or less each week but introduced 3 different kinds of workouts which kept me fresh through the course of training. At some stage in March I did a 10k TT in 44:54 and the coach reset my goal to 1:40. The half hour cancelled due to covid so I decided to do a time trial in Sydney Olympic Park with its endless supply of running and cycling tracks.

Pre-race
Did my usual pre race food of coffee with a couple of Marie biscuits and a banana. Drove over, did a few lumbar and thoracic activation drills and 2k warm up and got going. If was cold as fuck by Sydney standards at around 3c.

Race
While we had a 1:40 goal, we were confident of 1:38 given recent long run times. I was quietly aiming higher at 1:35 personally. I set out a bit conservative for the 1:35 goal not wanting to blow out, and clocked an average of around 4:35/km in the first 5ks. 

I felt good at this stage to stepped it up a little and took my first gel at km 8 and actually felt 1:35 was within grasp. It was warming up a little which I liked tbh, especially as my fingers were freezing when I got going. Kilometers 8-15 were a breeze overall and filled me with confidence. 

I started hitting what I thought was the wall around the 16th kilometer. Everything here on was a big push to the finish line and fully mental. I slowed down a notch, and the 1:35 goal was at a make or break point. I got into the last km knowing I needed an all out sprint at this stage to get under 1:35 but my legs were not turning fast enough. I got over the finish line in 1:35:39 and collapsed on the ground for a few seconds. 

Really happy with the time tbh, especially as I stated with a 1:48 goal only 5 months ago. 

Post-race
Wife came down and we drove to a cafe for a huge Turkish breakfast! Back home now, sore in all kinds of places and looking forward to a big nap!

## Training

If you want to read more about my training here is a post from a few weeks ago: [5k club race | race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/myine5/race_report_5k_club_race_1728/)

I did a 5k TT 3 weeks ago. Then I ran 17:28, the time before that was 17:55. Nothing really changed in my training in 3 weeks. The same HR runs. Some faster intervals. A week before the race I did 5x1k/90s rest. My splits were: 3:22 3:23 3:26 3:22 3:19. We were planning to run at a 3:25/km pace for the race. On the race week, my HR all of a sudden was really high. I don't know if it's stress or something, but it went up by like 5-10 beats from the previous week. Nothing really helped and I hoped the best on a race day.

## Pre-race

My race was in the evening so I had to chill all day. For breakfast, I had some porridge, sweet tea, three Nutella sandwiches. Then for lunch just some plain pasta. And later was just snacking on cookies. Did a 2.5 k jog and dynamic exercises to keep legs firing. It was strange. I haven't had a race in a year. Some excitement and start...

## Race

I knew I had to run my own race, not catch anyone or be first. My group was 16-18min runners. Didn't go out too fast, was at the right pace. The middle of the race is always the slowest for me. I overtook few guys, one overtook me, a few DNF'd. Don't remember what I was thinking. It's interesting how you can distinguish familiar voices from the crowd of screams. My dad took my time of 17:00.78. My watch was 17:00 flat. Maybe, just maybe the photo finish got under 17:00.

## Post-race

Of course, I am happy, I did two huge jumps in my time. Yeah, it could've been a second faster, but It's still good. I think by September I can definitely hit sub 16:30

AdvancedRunning,HanzJWermhat,Non-race Report,"Well this is an incredibly disappointing post but had to vent a little.

Race details:
26.2 miles
Virtual 
Target time: 3:30

I had been training the past 2.5 months for a solo marathon attempt that would happened today. I was aiming for a sub 3:30 and everything looked on track. Yasso 800’s sim and month ago, and all my workouts had me looking on track as long as conditions were right, a solid taper and good fuel and sleep. This was going to be my second marathon I had actually completed a marathon (3:40) in mid April during a training run. I hadn’t intended to go for the 26 miles that day just 23 but conditions were good even if my legs were fatigued. so with no taper, poor pre race fueling, and no support I decided to complete the 26.2 miles.

I knew I could do better and it was starting to get too warm to best my PB so mid May was the target. Everything was on track. 

Then “pop” no this wasn’t an overuse injury, but it was very dumb. Rewind time. I moved apartments on May 1st, I must have pulled something in my back on the right side, just slightly. It was mostly a niggle I ran 5 miles the next day then 14 miles the day after. Pain was manageable and I figured it was going to improve. I continued to do my lower intensity taper week with some intervals and long runs but way under my 45 mile training weeks. All the while the pain was there no better no worse. But on Wednesday I went out for a run, feeling great but one mile in I rounded a corner and pop, instant pain, stopped me dead in my tracks. Had to take a Lyft home. And that was it, terrible pain the next two days feeling a bit better today but all that work down the drain.

What’s next:

Well healing, trying to make sure I can get back into training without risk of injury, I’d really like to set some PB’s because I haven’t really utilized my found speed over the training. But going to focus on cycling more over the summer then start planning for races in the fall. 

I’ve got the itch and if sim’s said 3:30 this time. Fall I’ll be shooting for sub 3:25",1621098970

I tapered that down to about 12 miles a week since the marathon since my legs have been feeling so weak. Particularly at night, I wake up from the sensation of the muscle weakness in my legs.

AdvancedRunning,Cyclebuff1959,Should I join a post-collegiate competitive running team?,"Hi all! I (24F) am fully vaccinated for COVID and looking for a running club to join. There are a couple of running clubs in my area, but there is also a national and regional post-collegiate development team located about an hour away from me. I mostly just run for fun, but I found out that I (barely) meet one of the time standards to be on the regional development team (20:15 5k). 

A little background about me is that I ran in high school, battled a ton of injuries and eventually quit for several years, but picked up running again last year right before the pandemic. I haven't been following any specific training plan over the past year, but I am certainly hoping to drop some more time on my 5k. Because of that, I'm wondering if the competitive team would help motivate me to reach my running goals.

At the same time though, I've looked at the bios of some of the other runners on that team on their site and some of them are SO FAST! There's a handful of ladies on that team that have run under 17 minutes for a 5k. Naturally, with my 20:15 5k I feel a little intimidated lol.

For those of you that have joined post-collegiate running teams, what was your experience like? Running is definitely a huge passion of mine and I would love to get better, but I'm still wondering if a competitive team would be the right fit for me. Any advice would be appreciated!",1620848766

AdvancedRunning,LeetYeetMeat,Help with Base Building (M15)," I'm gonna start my sophomore XC season this fall, and I'm concerned about base building. During XC, I ran \~20 mpw and during track, I ran \~10 mpw (mostly speed-based training). My goal is to build up to 35-40 mpw, but it seems like I don't have enough time to go from 10 to 35-40 over the summer.

I'm aware of the 10-15% rule, down weeks, the danger of putting on too many miles too fast, etc. But it doesn't seem like that rate of progression will get me where I want to be. Although, last summer, I didn't know a lot about this and went straight from 0 mpw to 15-20 mpw (risky move but I was uninformed). They were distance runs from Mon-Fri, but I smoothly transitioned into higher mileage without any kind of injury. Running XC in 8th grade most likely helped with that.

Also, I'm part of a summer track club that trains 3 days a week. Should I stick with them while doing distance runs and such on other days or just quit entirely? Or should I just quit and train on my own? We'll only have a few races dispersed throughout the summer (I'm a 3000, 1500, &amp; 800).

That's pretty much my situation. Feels like a shit show, and my brain overthinks a lot when it comes to running, so that doesn't help. Any advice?

AdvancedRunning,edbl01,Tips for improving running cadence,"Hey all, I have been running for around a year but am coming back from injury. Now I am just doing some slow running, I wanted to really focus on my form/cadence.

At the moment my cadence is an awful 160! I want to get him up to 170-175, is there any drills I can do in particular or should I just go out at 175spm and try to maintain it?

I have done this successfully and finished with 172spm. Though my run felt easier, it was much slower (30s/mile) than any of my other runs. I don't mind running much slower, but I am worried that when it comes to interval work my running cadence will slack OR my pace will slack.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Another (side)question I have is: can your slow runs ever go too slow? (not slower than 9:00/mi) but say I was running 8:45/mile when my slow runs would usually typically be around 7:30-7:45. Assuming I maintain the same distance and not time.

AdvancedRunning,trail_lover,"Where to focus next in training - speed, base training, or threshold runs","I'm trying to improve my 5k time. Current PR is 21:07. Mileage is 80(ish)km /week, although I've had some weeks with less when life stress was too much, and some mountain and ultra adventures that push me into the 90s some weeks. I've mostly done easy running. I've been less consistent than I would like. 

Since March, I've done a few sets of intervals - a set of 800s, a set of 400s, a set of 200s, a set of 1000s, and a set of 1500s. I think I ran them all too fast, usually at max effort. 

I have not done much running in the middle. No threshold runs, for example. I'm either running fast or super slow (6+ min/km is comfortable for me). I could probably benefit from doing hill sprints (haven't done any). And I could do to run some 4-6 minute intervals at 3-5k pace (done almost none). I also feel like my mileage is low compared to what I see fast people running. So there lies my question. Where should I place my focus? 

I think my strength lies in middle distance sprinting. I'm also content to run at 100 mile pace all day (I've run a few ultras and do one every month or so for fun). I seem to be very weak with anything in the middle. Do I work on improving my weak area?

AdvancedRunning,ComprehensivePath457,Nike Vaporfly 4% vs Saucony Endorphin Pro HM TT test,"There are numerous comparisons of these two shoes out there but I couldn't find any that involved a real race-level effort. There are plenty that offer in-depth reviews of the fit, feel, etc., but none involve actual performance metrics. As such, I did a HM TT in each less than 2 months apart and thought others might be interested in the results. 

Most that I've seen compare the Next % to the Endorphin Pro but the Vaporfly 4% is close enough that it provides a great data point.

Ultimately, I think the Endorphin Pro is just as fast as the Vaporfly 4% (and presumably the Next % as well).

34 year old male, 5 foot 11 inches, approximately 187 pounds for both attempts. Have been consistently training for running for about 5.5 years with milage typically peaking in the 70s. Have averaged nearly 100 MPW for the last 14 months (except a rest month in December 2020). Neither attempt involved a taper and I run literally every day, including medium length runs at easy paces the day before the attempts. Similar training before both attempts but with just a bit more tempo work prior to the 2nd. 

Both TTs were about 95% of HM race-level effort. 

TT 1: March 2021. Ideal, flat course with approximately 56 feet of elevation gain/loss. Near-ideal conditions of 58 degrees, sunny, and 1.8 MPH wind. Low humidity. Time of 1:18:49 with negative split (40:25/38:24). 6:01 per mile. Shoes: Nike Vaporfly 4%.

TT 2: May 2021. Hilly course with approximately 476 feet of elevation gain/loss. Similar temperature of 55 degrees but with 10 MPW wind. Low humidity. Time of 1:17:45 with negative split (39:30/38:15). 5:56 per mile. Shoes: Saucony Endorphin Pro.

I have not included HR data because I'm not confident the HR data from my Garmin was correct for the 2nd attempt. It frequently has HR data that just doesn't make sense and TT 2 was highly questionable. But, again, effort was about 95% of race pace. 

Takeaways: As a bigger guy, hills crush me. I am much weaker on ascents than descents yet I was 1 minute faster even with the additional wind while wearing the Saucony Endorphin Pros. 

Thus, the training was pretty similar and had the TTs both been under the same conditions on the same course, I would have expected a slight improvement for TT 2 just due to the natural effects of training for 2 more months. However, TT 2 was on a significantly tougher course (especially for me) in windy conditions. If anything, it should have been a bit slower even though I managed to pace a bit more evenly. The 2nd half for both attempts was about the same, but I was still about 15 seconds faster with the Endorphins than the Vaporflys. The last 5k for both was nearly identical - only about 6-7 seconds faster for TT 2.

For me, it appears that both shoes perform about the same in race-level efforts. I was very surprised as I figured the Endorphin would be a really, really fast shoe but on a lower level than the Vaporfly. Despite the markedly improved time, I'm not saying the Endorphins are better than the Vaporflys. I've got a marathon in June and am still going to choose the Vaporflys over the Endorphins because I think they're pretty close to equal in performance. Personally, I think the Vaporflys are more comfortable. The Endorphins are much stiffer and kind of annoyed me after like 7-8 miles. 

Both had me feeling much stronger than I expected after halfway. I kept expecting to start hitting the wall but it just didn't happen. I didn't even come close to fading in the Vaporflys but I felt just a little bit of *potential* fatigue with the Endorphins. That could just be because they're stiffer and I could feel the pounding of the road a little more, I'm not sure. I believe they both produced a significant improvement in time over my prior choice of long-distance racers (Brooks Ravenna). That's obviously to be expected but I just don't know that there's much of a ***performance*** difference between the two.

Immediately after the TTs, my legs felt a little fresher with the Vaporflys. I also felt a little less beat up the next couple of days after TT 1 than TT 2. I still ran my typical 12-14 miles in the days following both efforts. I had less work/life stress during TT 1 while I had an extremely stressful day for TT 2 and the following days were very busy as well with crappy sleep. All was fine by day 3 following both TTs. 

In sum, both shoes performed about the same for me. If anything, the Endorphins outperformed the Vaporflys just a bit. I'll still reach for the Vaporflys for my upcoming marathon, however, as they feel more comfortable to me and I think they can hold off the fatigue a little longer than the Endorphins. Regardless, both are really, really fast shoes. I think Nike has some legitimate competition on their hands with these Endorphins.",1620706521

3. Ran my first marathon 4 years ago in about 4 hours 20 minutes.
4. Ran my last marathon in December 2019 in 3 hours 18 minutes. Leading up to this run, I ran about 40-50 miles per week with bo structured plan.
5. I logged a little over 2k miles in 2020 and followed Hanson's plan. At the end of the plan, I ran a 20 mile time trial where I finished in 2 hour 18 minutes, or 6:54 min/mi.
6. Today I ran a half marathon in 1 hour 26 minutes, or 6:34 min/mi. Leading up to this run I followed Hanson's plan where I ran about 40-50 miles a week with 2 key workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The workouts are typically at goal pace (6:30 for up to 7 miles), and  doing 2 x 3 miles repeat or 3 x 2 miles repeat at 10 seconds faster than goal pace (6:20). The long runs on Sundays are typically 14 easy miles, where I run about 8 min/mile.

Prior to running today's 13.1, I was hoping to carry whatever pace I was able to hold into the December marathon, with training kicking off in August. So, that would be setting a goal at  training to run the December marathon at 6:34 min/mile.

I have been running 45-55 mpw and am going to be starting pfitz’s 55 mpw marathon training plan in a few weeks for Twin Cities in the fall. 55-65 is as high as I can go due to time restraints of having three small children.

AdvancedRunning,doogiski,Cross Country Skier Therese Johaug Misses Norwegian 10km Tokyo Qualifying Time by 8 seconds,"I'm not sure who follows cross-country skiing as well as being a runner, but saw that yesterday Therese Johaug, arguably the best female cross-country skier in the world right now, attempted to qualify for Tokyo in the 10km, but missed the mark by 8 seconds. The qualifying criteria for Norwegian women is 30:25. 

Unfortunately, there are no English articles, so you'll have to Google Translate this link: [https://www.svt.se/sport/friidrott/johaug-11](https://www.svt.se/sport/friidrott/johaug-11)

What is insane about this is that running is a secondary sport for Johaug and she doesn't necessarily train for running for a large chunk of the year. While there quite a bit of running in traditional cross-country skiing training, it's all in the off-season and from the months of November to March there is basically no running as all training turns to on-snow sessions. What an extremely aerobically gifted individual.

The other woman that Johaug raced was Karoline Grøvdal who ran the 10km in 30:50. Last weekend, Grøvdal unofficially broke the women's 5km road world record in 14:39. That record may not be ratified because the course was measured by officials nor was there any doping control at the race.

AdvancedRunning,weedzgobot,Setting a realistic Sub 20 5K goal training timeframe,"In the summer of 2020, I decided I wanted to set the goal of running a sub 20 5K. I wanted to start running, and being a goal driven personality, this was picked sort of arbitrarily.

I had some running experience, but mostly surrounding the goal of weight loss. My main athletic focus is rock climbing. I had run a few 5Ks for fun, but nothing serious. When I started, I was barely able to break 30min. I started with couch to 5k and worked up from there, month by month.  Ran into some training injuries, but nothing a short break was unable to remedy.

I ran a time trial in the late fall of 2020 and ended up with a 23:57 time.

Again, arbitrarily, I picked a formal race the second weekend in May 2021 as the date I would attempt to run sub 20. I also picked up Jack Daniels book and started following that protocol for 5k. I had slowly worked up to 40-50mi per week and was hitting most of my workouts. Running thresholds and intervals on a treadmill with a mask wasn't the easiest. I was also climbing a lot and lifting a few days a week. 

Yesterday I ran a time trial on a track ( the formal race had been cancelled ) and hit 21:39. I was very satisfied with my time, even though I had not reached my ultimate goal. 

Over the next three months, I will be switching my training to climbing focused in preparation for a climbing trip the second week in August for two weeks. I still aim to run two easy runs, one long run and a tempo run at pace per week based my current fitness level, through my climbing training to maintain my running fitness. The climbing protocol suggests some aerobic training, so it should actually compliment nicely. 

This is a long way to get around to my question, which is this. What is a realistic timeframe to plan to run a sub 20 5K from here? After the climbing trip, I would like to jump back into running training through the fall winter and spring and maybe try again this time 2022. Does that seem realistic? Would sooner also be realistic?

The AR community has been an invaluable resource through this process, so thank you all for the time and effort you put into your questions and responses.

AdvancedRunning,ZeGuitarist,"Bonked during half marathon PR attempt, because Stryd let me down.","Here's a cautionary tale for all of you who use Stryd to track distance and pace. Read this before you buy into the marketing that Stryd is more accurate that GPS ""out of the box"".

**BACKSTORY:** I'm an average runner at best, but I'm passionate about running as a hobby, and I try to take my training seriously. I was at my peak in 2015, when I set a 5K PR of 19:30, and 10K PR of 41:40. Unfortunately, I suffered from a pelvic stress fracture, which took me out of running for two years (!).

I've been getting back into it *slowly* for the last few years, and I'm finally at a stage now where those old performances are back in reach. My goal for 2021 was to try and beat all of my PR's from 2015, starting with my half marathon PR which sat at 1:44:10. Admittedly, that time wasn't set during an all-out effort, it was just a training run - so I thought it should be the easiest of my old PR's to tackle.

**TRAINING:** after years of working through multiple injuries and bad running form, I finally got to a point where could run 50K a week injury-free, including a weekly interval session, a tempo run and a long run. I followed a training program prescribed by Trenara, an app that provides personalised and adaptive training schedule. It's made by locals, and works really well - check it out of you can!

Around the same time that I started this program, I got myself a Stryd. It's supposed to give you much more accurate pace and distance readings, with less fluctuations than you get with GPS. I thought it'd be a bonus to be able to hit the target paces from my training schedule more accurately, and thus make the most of my training.

I got through all the workouts without any major issues. The schedule was tough, but doable. From my data, the Trenara app predicted a finishing time of 1:33:11 (4:25 min/km pace). This seemed tough, but manageable if the conditions were right.

From the beginning, I was pretty happy with my Stryd, because it was instantly obvious that my pace readings were indeed a lot more consistent. The instant pace from all the GPS watches that I ever owned (all Garmin) was basically unusable due to it being all over the place. For the first time ever, I thought I was seeing pace readings I could actually *rely* on.

Boy was I wrong.

**THE RACE:** no event, no marked course, this was just a time trial that I planned to do solo. I was lucky to have a mate who is a much better runner than myself, who agreed to join me for the entire course for support.

We agreed to try and stay between 4:25 and 4:30 min/km pace, and keep the pace as steady as possible from start to finish. However, after the first K, my mate said he felt we were going too fast. My watch was set to get its pace readings from Stryd, and it said 4:30 spot on, so I didn't think much of it.

We kept at the same pace, and I was hitting every K at around 4:25 min as planned. At first it felt good, but after a while it became obvious that my heart rate was rising fast. I hit my zone 5 around the halfway point, and that's when it hit me something was wrong - I could never keep this up for another 10K.

At around 15K, my pace was down to just under 4:40 min/km, and after that I just went off a cliff. I was hanging on for dear life, I desperately wanted to quit (I probably would have if my mate wasn't there to drag me through), and at 20K I was basically crawling at just under 6:00 min/km - slower than my recovery runs, but it felt like I was giving everything I had. In the end, I managed to give it a final push just to stay under 1h40.

Final result: 1:39:56, and a broken mess of a man.

Then, however, my mate told me he had serious doubts about my distance reading. Basically, according to his watch he'd finished his 21,1K several minutes earlier, while apparently my Stryd was telling me I still had over half a K to go. This was consistent with the fact that he felt we were going too fast from the beginning.

**THE AFTERMATH:** when I got home, we compared our recordings, and indeed - turns out my Stryd completely skewed my readings.

My mate's GPS-recorded course almost exactly matched my pre-planned 21,1K course, while I apparently ran about 550 meters beyond the planned finishing point. This means I ran 1:39:56 over a distance of 21,65km, with an actual time of 1:37:29 for the half marathon distance.

That's why my pace readings were so off as well. Stryd gave me an average pace of 4:44 min/km over the entire course, but my friend's GPS watch said 4:37 min/km. That explains why my mate felt our pace was off from the start - his watch even said so, too.

All of this explains why I bonked so hard. It's a classic consequence of going off too quickly - only problem is I didn't even know it. Even more importantly, I probably messed up the entirety of my training schedule, by consistently going too fast for *every single run* because Stryd was underreporting my pace and distance all the time. That means my tempo runs were probably really threshold efforts, my threshold runs were probably anaerobic, and my intervals were probably too fast. Bottom line I likely wasn't well-adapted for my half marathon.

**TL;DR:** if you use Stryd for pace and distance, *calibrate it.* Don't believe the taglines saying ""it's accurate out of the box"". Don't go off on a half marathon time trial and bonk because Stryd underreports your pace and distance. Don't be me.",1620559216

AdvancedRunning,EducationalTeaching,How do you mentally push yourself without teammates or a treadmill?,"Hi all - I'm looking for feedback since I seem to be in a slight mental rut.  

To give a rough sense, my goal MP is around 6min/mi and I believe I'm capable of it based on my pre-Covid PR where I wasn't in as good of shape as now.  

The issue is I can complete workouts on a treadmill (with at least 1% incline) and used to have teammates before moving, but fall far short when training by myself on the roads.  For example, today called for a HMP tune-up and I just wasn't mentally in it.  Even around mile 2 I just wasn't able to push myself and the best mi split was the last one where I ""threw down"" and only did a 6:40.  

So, my question is, to those that have been in a similar spot, how do you mentally push yourself when it's just you out there on the roads and there's no one to pace or keep you accountable to the quality workout you're trying to achieve?",1620492407
AdvancedRunning,gf2020,Nearing Decision Time-- Metaspeed Sky vs. Next %2 vs. AlphaFly for a downhill trail marathon attempt at a sub three.,"My wife and I have a baby coming in August so my race in June is my last chance at a sub three for a long while. I have run a 3:00:51 in a similar race and looking for any advantage.

It's a steady downhill race in North Bend, Washington that drops about 2k in 26 miles. It's a trail race. I'm 6'0, 153 pounds

I have been running the last three years in Nike Vaporfly 4% because of good vibes and comfort level, but realize I need to upgrade and also because they aren't producing them anymore.

I am doing my long distance runs the next two weekends in Metaspeed Sky and next 2% that I just acquired. I have run a race once in AlphaFly and it wasn't my best but I don't attribute that to the shoe and also don't want to put additional mileage on them.

Are any of these three shoes more suitable for a downhill races than others? On a trail race, does weight matter more or less? Does heel drop matter and if so, which shoe offers advantage?

I am not a very well researched or expertly trained runner. I usually do what just feels right but I think I am being too fearful of change and it's coming anyway.  Knowing what I am facing, which shoe do you think is best in a vacuum? 

(I'll obviously check my personal comfort out over the next few weeks but there's just nothing that replicates the race itself.)

AdvancedRunning,FuzyWuzyWasABear,"Quarantine half marathon - ""race"" report","Due to family and work reasons, I had to travel to New Zealand from the US and required to spend 2 weeks in government provided quarantine (a hotel). The rules are pretty strict, which is not surprising given the lack of COVID in NZ. I'm now on day 5 (Saturday), with 9 days remaining. We weren't allowed access to the exercise area (a carpark) until we returned a negative COVID test, which meant no outdoors activity for the first 24 (ish) hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The past few days I've run 6 miles, 6 miles and 8 miles yesterday, all on a 250m loop of the carpark, which is our exercise area. I also threw in a beep test for good measure. It was tolerable due to the weather and spending a lot of time in my room (working) and we aren't allowed to use the exercise area after 5pm. Yesterday I decided I would try to run 15 miles today in 250m loops as my weekend long run. I ended up running a half instead.

&amp;#x200B;

""Race"" report:

\- I woke up at 4am for some weird reason and read for a while, I had breakfast (banana, 2 mandarins and a yoghurt) about 6am along with a couple of mugs of black tea and some water. A pretty typical breakfast.

\- At 9am I was out of my room as soon as we were allowed to get into the exercise area, I was the first and only person for about 30 minutes. I decided to run the opposite way most people have been walking / running the past few days, when others were walking around they seemed happy we'd switched directions.

\- First 5 miles. 7.26, 6.53, 6.27, 6.44, 6.44. As I said, I set out to run 15 miles but after the first 5 was feeling sharpish so thought I'd push a little harder. At 5 miles I swapped my now wet mask for a new one (we are required to wear masks outside).

\- Second 5 miles. 6.43, 6.34, 6.26, 6.29, 6.15. Felt solid through these 5 miles, more people arrived to do their own exercise (mainly walking) and I was getting a few side eyes. Swapped masks again at 5 miles, although this one was less gross for some reason.

\- Final 3.1 miles. 6.09, 5.59, 5.58, .44. Decided to try and hammer it out the last 3.1 miles. At this stage my math was not good and thought I had to run fast to beat 1h30m.

&amp;#x200B;

My final time was 1h25m28s over 13.13 miles according to my watch. I was happy with that and a little surprised considering I wasn't planning on trying to run a quick(ish) half. My prep wasn't awesome being in quarantine, plus before I left the US I had PT for the past 6 weeks along with some dry needling for a niggling hip injury, my mileage went down to about 40 miles per week the past few weeks and I'm typically a 60-80 mpw - I prefer to run ultra's rather than road races.

### OSR and race description
For those that are unaware, OSR races are about pretty far from a standard NYRR or officially marshaled races. They've taken a life on their own, often attracting a competitive field of runners, and the unsanctioned and often quirky nature of the races are what makes it exciting and fun. 

For this race, runners started the race at 2:00 am (yup - that's not a typo) on the streets of Manhattan, had to run through midtown to 4 different checkpoints to collect: 

1) a vintage bread bag based on OSR founder Joe DiNoto's original family restaurant 
2) a plastic spoon
3) a roll of bread 
4) a stick of butter

runners then had to make their way to the finish at the base of the Manhattan bridge, again, running whatever route they like (and deems most efficient). 

No route or street closures. No bibs. No official timing. No race bathrooms. No medals. 

### Race
2am line up at 42nd and 1st, with a field of about ~100 runners, split 65/35 (?) among men/women. First checkpoint was UN by 46th and 1st for the bread bag. Second checkpoint was on the upper level of Grand Central, where there is car access only, and we had to run through the Metlife building ramps. Luckily at 2am, there aren't too many cars around midtown. Third  checkpoint at St. Patrick's cathedral at 51st and 5th, and last checkpoint at the Intrepid museum on the west side. 

After the last checkpoint, I decided to go through and down Broadway // Bowery to the finish at the base of the Manhattan Bridge. I know a lot of other runners decided to run down the West Side highway path, given no lights and I think is 0.03 miles shorter, but I figured if I was going to run on the streets at 2:30am, I was going to run on the streets. 

I tried to keep pace around a 6:40 - so still working, but not running for my life. Considering this was my first OSR race (and being up for a whole day of work and meetings), just wanted to have fun out there. 


### Post-race
I finished through at Pike slip between South and Cherry a little before 3am. There had already been a crowd of finishers there, and again no official time tracking so going by Garmin time. I think in terms of finishers I was mid-pack to just slower than the median finish time? For reference the men's winner ran and won it at a 5:13/mi. Hi-fived some friends of mine, got an uber home, stretched/showered, and napped for 5 hours before getting up for work the next day. 

Overall, 10/10 race experience. Would I do it again at 2am? Maybe

AdvancedRunning,Equatick,Low MPW &amp; Emphasis on Cross-Training for Female Winner of British Olympic Marathon Trials (RW),"[Link to Runner's World article](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a36301124/two-british-runners-used-cross-training-for-wins/) (free article limit)

This was an interesting read, and against the typical ""run more"" response to how to get faster. Stephanie Davis, who won the women's British Olympic Marathon Trials with a PR of 2:27:14, typically runs more than 30 miles per week. She does, however, ride her bike five times a week, swims for 90 minutes five days a week, and does two strength sessions along with one yoga session. When she ramped her mileage up in the last Olympic Trials cycle, she was plagued by ITBS and had to take a considerable break. This reminds me of Ann Mazur (OTQ'er), who credits yoga and low mileage to her success in running fast and injury-free.

Davis also has a full time job in finance, which makes her relatable to most of us non-pros. Personally, though I am far from elite, my body breaks down when I ramp up mileage and greatly benefits from cycling and other forms of cross training. Getting back into regular yoga has always been a goal of mine that I can't seem to commit to!

Curious what others think. I do believe high mileage will reign supreme, but this is a nice reminder that more (running) miles is not necessarily the recipe for everyone. I am also a woman who pays attention to women runners more than men, so this is perhaps a more suitable strategy for females.",1620343700

AdvancedRunning,PhysioPants,The Low Hanging Fruit of Injury Prevention Part 1: Recovery.,"This is posted on r/running as well, but in discussion with the mods prior to posting I wanted to post it here as well. Hope those of you who haven't seen it enjoy. 

**Some background to start:**

This will be a weekly run down of some of the real basics to start to nail in terms of preventing injuries. Broadly speaking it’s going to be discussing, week by week:

1. Recovery (Sleep, Food, Stress)
2. Training
3. Strength Training &amp; Mythbusting

**Who this is for:**

This is generalist advice for everyone, however with some bias towards the newer/intermediate runner. Advanced runners should be doing most of this anyway, although it should act as a good reminder. You’ll see throughout that I advocate that you seek professional advice if you’re unsure, and this is really important. I know that there’s always a desire to try to self-diagnose, work with information online, but it’s really critical to realise that you will get masses of conflicting advice/information which will lead to extreme frustration if you are looking to solve a problem. Find a professional you can work with, and work with them if you feel that you can't work in isolation.

**Who this is not for:**

Those with a current acute injury who are looking for advice. Nothing that I’m laying out here will be specific enough for you to take action. Please seek help via a local medical professional if you are struggling with a current acute injury. 

**Who am I?**

In brief, I’m a UK based HCPC registered physiotherapist – I primarily work in acute hospitals/post-hospital rehab (trauma, ITU etc.) but have a special interest in runners and exercise physiology. 

**Why am I writing this?**

I’ve commented on a few threads recently describing my feelings towards certain modalities, and I’ve received (and occasionally still do) PMs from people asking me to flesh out my answers. I thought it would be useful as a community resource to provide a longer read for those who are interested. 

**Working from an available evidence base**

This is important for a multitude of reasons, and I open with it because throughout this post I’ll present some of the evidence base behind certain interventions. There are some that I won’t be able to provide a paper on, however, but I’ll provide the reasoning behind why I would advise doing it. I have also tried to make papers from open access sources where possible. 

**Taking a holistic approach**

We are all only human. As a result, it needs to be made clear early that as you sit there to read this, you have to consider your running (or other athletic endeavour) in the course of you as a whole person. To just assume a running injury is caused solely by biomechanical factors is unfair to yourself, and sometimes that presents a barrier to effective treatment. Your body can only tolerate a certain amount of stress – and the goal really is to limit the amount you are suffering from other (avoidable) sources so that you can run more. Simple. Kinda. 

**The low-hanging fruit approach**

I hope this is an appropriate description for a lot of people. What I mean when I describe something as ‘low hanging fruit’ is that these interventions are something that nearly everyone can integrate into their daily lives without a lot of fuss, pain or expense. In some ways they are also the foundation of us being healthy humans. They do not need to be adhered to as if you are a monk, but a general trend in that direction is important for all sorts of reasons for both mental and physical health.

**What causes injuries?**

I see a lot of people who have lost the wood for the trees in this respect. My feeling, and something I tell my patients over and over again (whatever I’m seeing them for), is that an injury has occurred because you have exceeded the load that the tissue is able to take. This can happen acutely (falling over causing a broken bone) or chronically (inadequate recovery leading to tendinopathy). 

The chronicity aspect is what gets most runners. If you do not recover properly your body suffers from an increasing load each time you go out, thus increasing your risk of developing an injury. 

This concept seems simple enough – but there is an interacting web of factors that contribute to this. Your genetics, gender at birth, past medical history, running age, physical age, work stress, environmental factors, injury history. All of this contributes to what causes your injury, and this is why when someone provides you with injury advice over a forum, they are almost inevitably, while well meaning, wrong.. This is also why I’m providing very general advice here: If you are worried, please see a properly qualified medical professional for appropriate triage, diagnosis and treatment. 
To avoid injury then, we need to make sure that load is appropriate, and that recovery is good enough. How do we go about that?

**Sleep**

How many recovery devices are on the market currently? Or supplements? Everyone is hunting for that ‘hack’ that allows them to feel more recovered, when the best possible thing is to sleep well and more consistently. There are evidenced links between sleep deprivation and injury risk ([here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028798/)). 

The goal is always to try and increase the amount of sleep that you’re having, and also improving the quality of it. I suggest tracking it somehow, either via a watch or the old pen and paper method. Either approach you use, you should be subjectively asking yourself when you wake up ‘Do I feel rested?’. If you feel dead until you’ve managed to drain coffee number 3 of the day, then maybe either more sleep or better quality sleep is an area you can improve on. Naps are great for this, if you’re lucky enough to be able to schedule some.

How you go about this is entirely up to you, you can spend as much money as you want (perfect mattress, air conditioning, water circulating blanket) or as little. My personal feeling, and the starting point for most people is to follow some general advice regarding sleep hygiene (Some great resources [here](https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/fact-sheets.html)) and to try to start going to bed earlier each night where possible (start with 15 min, build up as able). Again, there is no need to become completely neurotic about this, but it’s about demonstrating a general trend towards improvement. Alcohol before bed can be very troublesome for some people, too, and can interrupt your overall sleep pattern. 
It's obviously important to accept that there are going to be periods of your life where you are going to get less sleep for whatever reason – young children, puppy, work stress, life stress. At these times, I would always advocate for dropping some intensity from your workouts. Your body is already stressed. Adding more to the heap is probably going to make things worse. 

**Food**

To be clear – I’m not a dietician. If you have concerns about what you’re eating, I would strongly advocate for a good conversation with an appropriately qualified dietician. I would look at qualifications of nutritionists carefully, before you work with them. 

I’m not here to try to persuade you down a certain avenue of what you should be eating. Whether vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, dessertarian, whatever. It’s about balance. You need to be taking in an adequate amount of calories for the amount of work that you are doing, and this needs to come from varied sources. Your body will literally break itself down if it’s not fed enough (Interesting reading [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751603/) and [here](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/3/835/pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CSiJYJeOCs2aywSdprWYAw&amp;scisig=AAGBfm2QRofnf9VSisc3cSFiQSzibEHXRA&amp;nossl=1&amp;oi=scholarr). The second is more athlete focused, the first makes for general reading on advanced starvation - hyperbolic, maybe, but useful!

One of the main areas that I see people making this mistake is when they are starting a hard training block. They are attempting to increase intensity and volume at the same time as they’re going into a semi-aggressive weight cut of -500kcal per day. This is too much stress for a lot of people. Sure, some people they are able to manage it, but if you are cutting a significant amount of your dietary intake you need to compensate by reducing in other areas.

I think [this](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/an-active-lifestyle/eating-for-sport-and-exercise.html?showall=1&amp;limitstart) is a fairly solid guide to get you going if it’s an area you are unsure of. Nutrition is a minefield of conflicting advice, so beware the huge rabbit hole should you wish to go down that route. Everyone will disagree with everyone else, I personally would advocate for a common sense approach with everything in moderation – plenty of veg, protein source of choice, some carbohydrates. 

You can stress yourself out significantly with nutrition, and especially if you have a history of issues with food, I would suggest seeking expert advice if you feel you need it.

**Life and Work Stress**

I would be being unfair if I attempted to draw a direct line between work stress and increased risk of injury. However, any form of external stress to your running (work, life, illness) is going to affect your ability to recover. The mental fatigue of an awful day at work can take you a long time to get past, and this will show in your running. In terms of how you sustainably weave running into your life this is really up to you, but I would always advise that the really hard sessions should just get shelved if you feel awful, even if it's 'just' mentally. Beating yourself into the ground for your hobby is something you are free to do if you want, but I would advise against it if it’s going to stop you from functioning as the human being you want to be. 

Next Wednesday I'll post something regarding training, and the errors that are commonly made (from the point of view of injury prevention and durability, less so performance). Feel free to ask questions in the comments, and I'll try to respond as and when I'm able. Critisism also welcomed. Thanks for reading, hope you found it useful.",1620331412
AdvancedRunning,PRsAndDR,Fitness Maintenance,"Hey all. I want to preface this by saying I really value this subreddit and have learned a lot about running by browsing threads and reading comments. I, like many others, started running when the gyms closed at the beginning of the pandemic and started to become more serious in the Fall of 2020. I'm by no means advanced, but I'm pretty dedicated to improving and am currently running about 50 miles per week. Some PRs are a 5:45 mile, 43:10 10k, and 1:42:55 half marathon.

I am also an avid weight lifter, and am trying to bulk back up to previous strength levels whilst trying to maintain (or even improve) my running fitness for when I begin marathon training this upcoming Fall and dial back on the lifting. I'm feeling pretty burnt out and my legs feel dead most of the time now when I run, so I am thinking 50 mpw might be a bit too much with high volume weight lifting. Does anyone have a suggestion for a weekly running regimen that would be good for a ""maintenance"" phase while I prioritize lifting? 

For reference, my current schedule is:

Monday - off/recovery run, upper body lift

Tuesday - easy run, lower body lift

Wednesday - track workout, no lifting

Thursday - off/recovery run, upper body lift

Friday - easy run, lower body lift

Saturday - easy run, upper body lift

Sunday - long run (15 miles usually), no lifting

AdvancedRunning,leakywellington,Periodizing your strength training (for running),"I'm looking for some advice/resources on how to best periodize my strength training alongside running. From what I understand, there are three boxes to tick off:

* stability (e.g., one-legged exercises)
* strength (e.g., heavy deadlifts)
* plyometrics (e.g., box jumps) 

It seems like the general focus should move from stability (early base), developing strength (mid-to-late base), maintaining strength (precomp/comp), and finally to plyometrics (precomp/comp).

But I'm curious on specifics. Here are a bunch of questions that came to mind:

* How does this actually look in a program? I haven't found any books that seem to cover it in detail (e.g., an actual 16 week strength training program for runners), and the online stuff seems pretty pricey (the Strength Running course on this is 200–300 USD).
* Should all these exercises be lumped into the one or two 30–60 minute strength training sessions each week? Or are stability exercises better suited to go with the daily core work after each run? And/or maybe the plyos after a speed (running) workout?
* At what point do you want to transition from strength development (e.g., adding plates to your squat each week) to maintenance? Is it precomp (e.g., when anaerobic workouts start picking up)?
* For the heavy stuff, what's the recommended set/rep breakdown? Should it be low reps to avoid adding muscle mass, e.g., 5 sets of 5 reps? Starting heavy (after a warm-up) like is suggested in ""Healthy Intelligent Training"" (Livingstone) or the more classic ramp-up from lighter to heavier weights?
* Is it useful to do plyos in the base period at all, or does it only make sense in the precomp/comp?

Any thoughts on this stuff—or book/video recommendations—would be fantastic. Thanks!",1620246502

AdvancedRunning,tdbnyc,lower GI distress at 10+ miles,"Just finished up a Half marathon cycle and did my first person race on Sunday -- was feeling great except.. at 10 miles my body told me if I didn't walk some I would be needing a porta-potty really soon.

I've done three training blocks with Pfitz marathon plans.  I've also used a Daniels plan for a 5k.  But I've never tried a marathon training plan from DRF.  I like the idea of the 4-week-cycle plans.  You have 3 intense weeks, then one week with high-volume, low-intensity. However, reading through the 56-70 mpw plan raises a few questions:
- The workouts seem intense, in comparison to Pfitz workouts.  A 23 mile run and a 22 mile run in the same week? 16 continuous miles at MGP? 5 miles of T intervals, followed by 5x3 min H, followed by 8x200 R?
- Daniels makes the plan for 26 weeks, but says that ""it is certainly possible to jump in less than 26 weeks before the marathon."" Those who have tried the plans, where did you start? Did you make any adjustments?
- Doing all easy runs and strides the week before a marathon seems like a bad idea.  To the best of my knowledge, you want to lower volume but not intensity.  Scheduling a rest week the week before a big race seems like lowering intensity.",1620175548

AdvancedRunning,PeninsulaPhysioGrant,Australian Physio hoping to share what I've learned about running-related injuries,"Hey all, I hope it’s ok that I post the following.

As a Physiotherapist, I see so many people struggling with running-related injuries and I can see so many on this subreddit feeling the same way as well, so I’d love to help if I can. I posted something similar to this on the main running subreddit and it was really well received, so I'm hoping the idea is just as helpful here.

My passion as a Physio is to uncover and solve the root cause of common (and uncommon) aches and pains. And if it's ok, I’d love to pass on some really important information I’ve learnt over the last 15 years in terms of why running injures seem to happen and what’s important to focus on if you want them to go (and stay) away.

Firstly, from what I've found clinically, there are two really important things to consider when discussing running injuries.

1. The onset of most running-related injuries aren't actually caused by running (despite how silly that sounds). In my experience the repetition of running is just really good at exposing something we take into running. Essentially they're the last straw, not the start of something new.

2. Running is, by definition, normal for the human body to do.
A running injury doesn’t mean running is bad or abnormal for anyone. Again, it's just really good at exposing hidden flaws we accrue in other areas of our lives and take in to running.

If we take common running-related issues like foot stress fractures, Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendonitis, Shin Splints, calf tears, knee cap pain, Patella Tendonitis, ITB Syndrome, hamstring &amp; quad injuries, anterior hip pain, Gluteal Tendonitis, groin strains, low back pain, etc, it’s important to consider that these are actually not isolated, seperate issues divorced from each other. Yes, they're all considered different injuries to different parts of the body. But, from my experience, each are actually just a different expression of similar root issues - which I’d like to highlight.

For example, even though issues like plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, knee cap pain, and ITB dysfunction are considered completely different issues, they generally come from the same basic dysfunction - ankle stiffness, hip rotational tightness/weakness, and even low back dysfunction in a lot of cases. Essentially, the presence of these kinds of “hidden” features force the leg to work around them ultimately loading up the foot, the heel, and the knee differently to what they’re designed to handle. And if exposed to repetitious movements over time (hello running), anything within the entire system can be set up to fail. And I think this is really important to mention because many common treatments for each of the above issues are very specific to those areas - arch supports, heel raises, isolated stretches, VMO strength, etc. And the problem with these ideas is that, although still important and ultimately helpful, they don’t solve the underlying issues. So in many instances, we aren't fixing the cause - leaving many frustrated if there’s a lack of overall progress.

So the point I’d love to make to anyone trying to overcome any running-based injuries at the moment is that you need to look at how your whole leg and low back are going regardless of where your issues currently are. Yes, there will be some specific things that will help manage your pain in the short-term, but a broader focus can shut the door entirely. And to help figure this out, here is a list of the most common issues I’ve found clinically set other things up to fail and why:

- Joint stiffness at the junction of the Thoracic Spine and Lumbar spine: Stiffness here can short-circuit gluteal function. Do you have weak glutes? They may not actually be weak, just deactivated by spinal stiffness. Interestingly, I’ve found stiffness here also contributes to the onset and persistence of hip flexor pain, and patella tendonitis.

- Stiffness in the lower lumbar joints: These relate heavily to the sciatic nerve which supplies and influences many of the muscles down the back of the leg. Hamstring issues, calf issues, Achilles issues, and even plantar fasciitis can be the expression of basic joint stiffness in the lower back.

- Muscular and joint restrictions at the front of the hip: Restrictions at the front of the hip can contribute to anything from low back pain, hip pain, all knee pain, anything associated with poor arch function - Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, ITB pain, shin splints, etc. Its a huge issue for many thanks to the amount of sitting we have to do on a daily basis.

- A lack of rotation at the hips: This contributes to almost everything. It’s insane how often improving someone’s hip external and internal rotation leads to an immediate improvement in the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and low back complaints when running.

- Ankle joint stiffness: Put this alongside hip rotational deficits as a leading hidden cause of almost everything. Plantar fasciitis, shin splints, Achilles pain, almost all knee pain, etc can be improved by decreasing the presence of ankle joints stiffness. This one is so important to work on as a stiff ankle genuinely forces the entire leg to move differently in order to work around it. Any structure in close proximity to ankle joint stiffness will be forced to take up the load a rusty ankle can’t support, opening many runners up to aches and pain. It's also worth noting that ankle joint stiffness is different from muscle tightness. I'm talking a rusty ankle joint rather than creating muscular ""stiffness"".

You may notice that I haven’t mentioned much about weakness. Clinically, I find you can’t out-strengthen stiffness - meaning I’d prioritize getting rid of stiffness over going after strength if you only have time to focus on one. Clearly, you can (and should) go after both, but I find stiffness to be the bigger factor in causing the compensation needed to create adjacent injury. Interestingly, as mentioned above gluteal weakness is often a symptom of low back dysfunction anyway. So strengthening weak glutes, while helpful, may not get you any closer to never having to do it again if your back is still shutting them down. As the low back improves I find the glutes wake back up again. Clearly, you can do gluteal strength exercises to round this off nicely, but without the low back stuff, you’ll most likely have to keep focusing on those strength exercises until you get sick of them rather than stopping because you don't need them anymore.

Here are a few other important things I've come to learn: 

- Variations in footwear do not make a genuine change in your underlying mechanics. They're a bandaid. Clinically I’ve found that if adding any footwear technology “improves” how you feel or run, it's compensating for something you are missing with your body mechanics. If arch support makes you feel nicer then that tells me that some hidden issues need to be addressed so you don’t need to rely on arch support forever. The same goes for heels. I find barefoot shoes are a great way to “expose” flaws in someone's mechanics. If you can’t tolerate being barefoot and running (which are both normal) then it’s a clear sign to me that something is missing behind the scenes.

- The two biggest creators of the list of hidden issues that I've found over the years are time spent sitting and heeled shoes/flip flops. Sitting - particularly slouching is often responsible for much of the hidden low back dysfunction I see. The act of sitting itself tends to account for the majority of hip stiffness and tightness I see. Heeled shoes and flip flops are a haven for stiff ankles. Any range you don’t get to use thanks to the size of the heel is essentially lost the longer you wear them.

There's plenty more, but this is obviously a huge post. So I'm happy to answer any burning questions anyone has them.

Ultimately, I just want to let people know that if you have an issue that isn't settling take a step back and consider what else is going on above and below the issue. Also, I genuinely hope that some of these ideas turn out to be the missing piece to someone's pain puzzle. Or at least the little spark in perspective that helps you find it. Especially if its stopping you from doing something you love. Again, I’d love to answer any questions that might arise from this.

If anyone's interested, I have a small YouTube channel that I use to shed light on what I'm finding clinically, and offer up solutions based on what works for my patients.

AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Aerobic Running and Base Training,"Since last Sept I've been doing a lot of 5k and LT pace work (\~6:20 and \~6:50 min/mi), and I run very easy the rest of the time (9:15 - 10 min/mi), on long runs too unless there was some LT or speed work scheduled in. I have been running mostly 40-50mpw in that time, up from 20-30mpw avg for the preceding year. Made some decent progress and haven't been injured which is great, but its apparent that my aerobic conditioning/endurance isn't great based on a recent half marathon tt and how I've felt during the occasional faster long run or long tempo, and it's something I want to work on for the next few months during base training before a fall marathon, possibly by doing more running between 7 and 9 min/mi.

What does your base training look like? Do you do much running slower than half marathon pace but faster than easy pace? Lydiard for example seems to be a proponent of running faster than easy, but still aerobic, for a lot of the base miles. Right now I'm thinking of speeding up 1-2 easy runs to steady/easy effort, and doing some longer slower tempos 30-40 mins closer to marathon pace or something.

AdvancedRunning,iam_indefatigable,Race Report - McKirdy Micro Marathons Rockland - 2:16:51 wait... what?,"Wanted to crosspost from r/running but it wouldn't let me, meh.

Information

Location: Rockland Lake State Park

Distance: 26.2 miles

Time: 2:16:51

Pace: 5:13/mi (3:15/km)

Splits/strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/5230561953

After a very successful 50k+ (see my previous report for more info) back in March, my coach and I decided that we needed to get me in a marathon within 4-6 weeks of my last race. After shopping around a bit, looking for competitive fields, I instead settled on doing my marathon at a small race being put on by McKirdy Trained, where I would undoubtedly be doing my effort solo, but on the same course where I had set my half marathon PR back in November of 2020. I liked this course for two reasons: first it was completely pancake flat, and second, it was a \~3 mile loop, which would allow for perfect nutrition timing. Additionally the loop was reasonably close to my family, so I could make it into a nice weekend visit, only having to do a 5 hour drive from where I live and staying with them overnight.

The race started at 6:30am which meant that I had woken up at around 3:50 to get in some breakfast (bowl of honey bunches of oats), make sure my maurten/nuun was properly mixed into my bottles, and then drive over to the course from my dad’s apartment where I was staying. My coach had called me the week prior to let me know that he would be there to lead me around the loop as a bike escort (which we had permission to do from the race director), so I showed up, pumped some extra air into my bike tires, and passed it off to him to use for the day. I did about a mile and a half of warm up, followed by some light dynamic stretches and leg swings, then it was over to the start line. The countdown began, and then I was off.

As expected I went straight out ahead of the field, doing my best to keep the pace reasonably easy to start, with the hope that I would pick it up as the race went on. The goal was to go through the first half around 69:30, and then work down by feel. The first loop was slightly short to account for the fact that 9x3=27, which would be too far for the marathon, and I came through waiting for my first bottle, only to see that my dad and girlfriend were nowhere to be seen. Now luckily I wasn’t too worried about getting that first bit of nutrition less than 3 miles into the marathon, and I told my coach on the bike that if we didn’t see the during the next lap that he should go grab the bottles from my car and we’ll hope that doesn’t count as receiving illegal help. Luckily for me I saw their car heading towards our predetermined nutrition spot (again, in compliance with the race), so I knew that the next time around I would get my maurten/nuun electrolyte mix.

As I had done with previous races, my watch was set to kilometers so that I wouldn’t feel freaked out by the numbers I was looking at, but I did have a generally good idea that I was running right on pace, if not a little bit quick to hit the halfway point at my goal. Each lap was feeling about the same as the last, my nutrition was sitting well in my stomach, and the weather conditions still felt very comfortable. I began to see some faster kilometer splits pop up on my watch, but still didn’t think they seemed out of range, so I kept going ahead, encouraging those I was lapping, and occasionally exchanging some words with my coach.

We hit the halfway point in around 69:02. A little on the quick side, but still feeling excellent. I told my coach that I wanted to just keep going at a steady effort until the last 6 miles, and he liked the idea of that. However, we both realized that I was steadily dropping the pace with each split, but at the same time was not looking any more tired, or having my form degrade even a little bit. The few who were out spectating began to recognize this, and were getting progressively more excited. With 3 laps (\~9 miles) to go, things were starting to get wild. The cheers were getting louder and more focused on the pace I was running, and although I was letting those cheers fuel me, I was refusing to acknowledge the pace. “I’m not making any big changes until 6 miles to go” I say to my coach, even though I’m already running faster than I was expecting to at any point during the race. The kilometer splits are really clicking off hard now: 3:08, 3:08, 3:08, but we just keep repeating “stay calm, don’t do anything crazy”.

At this point I’ve heard people say that I’m on pace for somewhere in the 2:16s. I ignore them, because I know if I start to think about that too hard I might lose my cool and start crying or something, so I just focus on putting one foot in front of another as efficiently as possible. With 4 miles to go, I feel the cumulative stress of all those miles start to creep into my legs. The last lap is a sufferfest. The 3:10/k that felt scarily easy is now feeling scarily uneasy, but by my calculations, as long as I don’t start really dropping off, I’m gonna be WELL under my stretch goal of sub-2:18. The last two miles are a battle. I feel as though I’m slowing down significantly, and I’m throwing in surges only to immediately fade. My watch says I’m still running fast, but I don’t trust it.

I’m running the loop for essentially the ninth time today, so every landmark leading up to the finish line is unavoidable. Half mile to go, quarter mile to go, the finish is right there, the clock is ticking towards 2:17, am I gonna be under? Holy \*\*\*\* I’m gonna be under. Nothing short of ecstasy hits me as I cross the line. I let out several SCREAMS, and I mean warrior scream. I high five my dad, kiss my girlfriend, and then collapse on the ground in a puddle of sweat and tears.

My previous marathon PR was 2:23:43 from October 2019, and I ran a 65:34 half at this same location back in November, so it’s hard for me to really say when I thought I would hit this time. My coach and I have discussed what some of my “lifetime goals” are for running, but this time really felt like it was going to be much further down the road. I’ve always had this feeling that I was capable of more than I’ve done up until now, but it's never felt like it has been for lack of effort. I honestly couldn’t tell you what is clicking for me now other than that I’m the happiest I’ve ever been while running, and my training has been exceptionally consistent and simple over the past three years. It’s been a wild ride to get here, and now that I feel I’ve started to really arrive, the process has been so incredibly gratifying.

AdvancedRunning,Equatick,At the end of my rope with quad tendinopathy/tearing,"This is an uncommon injury, so I would be surprised if anyone here has gone through this - but who knows, and I would be delighted to have any insights or just someone to commiserate with!

In December, an MRI revealed I have 25-50% tearing in my quad tendon near where it connects to my patella. Essentially, this is an overuse injury but I was blindsided - I really had no symptoms, but one evening had a good ride on the Peloton but when I got off I was in tremendous pain that worsened over the next few days. I could barely walk and was in excruciating pain, not to mention my knee was extremely swollen.

I've been in PT for over four months now, and three weeks ago had a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection (side note - holy hell, that was the most painful thing I have ever experienced). Anywho, this is considered an experimental treatment with varying and by no means guaranteed levels of success. For me, my condition has unfortunately *worsened*. I've regressed significantly in PT. I don't believe the PRP itself is to blame, but it does not seem to have helped (though I will give it a few more weeks).

I'm meeting with my doctor again in several weeks, but I am just so discouraged and frustrated that I can't live my life. If surgery is required, that's off the table for me for another year or so, so that does force me to be patient with my healing in the meantime. However, I'm very curious if there's anyone here who has had a similar injury and what their treatment and outcomes looked like.

AdvancedRunning,BelfastRunner,Training Plan Feedback," 

*Edited to include information:*

Hi Y'all,

I'm running a marathon this fall and am interested in following a self-designed program instead of one out of a book. I've followed Pfitz a few times before (and also dabbled with Daniels and Tinman for shorter races), but now I want to see if I've internalized any of the information and can turn it into a workable plan for myself. I've come here for some feedback on what I've come up with to see what y'all think.

* Age: 30
* Sex: Male
* Current MPW + pace: 30 - 40 around 9:00 on super easy days
* Previous peak MPW: 65
* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed: 10 miles with 28 mins 7:00 mpw
* Goals (including specific races): Sub 3 (one day) Sub 3:15 this fall
* Previous PRs: 3:29 maraton back in 2019. 19:06 5k

You can find the plan with a sample goal of 7:23 per mile or 3:13 with a peak of 70 mpw at this link:

Really curious to see what people think of it.

A few organizing principles:

* Don't go from 0-100. Follow at least an 8-week build to week 2 mileage before starting
* The plan is 14 weeks long:  

   * Weeks 1-4 are a build to peak mileage with a step back week on week 4
   * Weeks 5-11 are 6 peak weeks held at peak mileage with a step back week on week 8
   * Weeks 12-14 are the taper weeks
   * Half-Marathon tune-up around week 10 or 11
* 4 training paces:  

   * Easy days: 2:00 p/m slower than race pace (or slower depending on feel)
   * MLR/LR: 1:00 p/m slower than race pace
   * Threshold: 0:30 p/m faster than race pace
   * VO2 Max: 5k-10k pace
* Reading the calendar:  

   * The first block of weeks is weeks 1-4. Follow these exactly
   * The second block of weeks is weeks 5-10. Repeat this block twice, but do not do the step back week the second time
   * The third block is the taper. The first week of this taper block replaces the second step back week of block 2",1620075677

AdvancedRunning,jugglerthe,Tips for training in the rain,"So for the first time in my life I find myself living in a country where regular rain is just normal. 

I would usually just stay indoors or gym but gyms are closed and I'm currently building up my mileage as prep for a full marathon later in the year so I have to go if I want to follow my plan. 

Any suggestions for running in the rain? I don't plan to go when it's pouring but I expect I'll have to get used to running when it is drizzling. Really hoping I can avoid it for my long runs. 

Do you wear specific gear or just dress up in something warm and go for it? It's usually 5-15C when it's raining here and there's usually a strong wind to add to the pain/fun. A colleague told me it's fun to run in the rain (I literally have no idea how that is true 😀)

AdvancedRunning,nonamenolastname,Shooting for a Boston qualifier - training advice,"59M, 160lb, started to do target HR training, 35 MPW @ 9:15/mi, which puts me in zone 2. Before I was doing 28 to 30 MPW, but since slowing down my pace, I can do more miles without feeling tired or injuring myself, a plus for me. I'm considering adding a few more miles per week.

My marathon PR last year was 4:03, right before the pandemic hit. I'll be 60 next year, for 2020 the qualifying time was 3:48:21, so I need to shave ~20min from my PR.

I'm really willing to put the effort; my questions:

1. Any specific training plan you would recommend?
2. Any runners around my age with specific recommendations for an old fart like me?
3. Race day fueling strategy? I've been forcing myself to eat during my long runs, as if I try anything other than water, it upsets my stomach, which translates to invariably hitting the wall pretty hard. Spring Energy gels seem to settle OK, so I'm taking them even when I don't feel like it.
4. Folks who have done target HR training, did it work out for you?

AdvancedRunning,axr33,Sleep and anxiety before races,"Disclaimer: NOT looking for medical diagnosis/services 
Hey, all! I wanted to get in here and seek some advice on an issue I’ve been having recently. M24 and have been running since middle school. Throughout my high school and college career, sleep the night before a race was never a huge issue, maybe once before a state meet. I would usually just take melatonin and conk out. However, in the time after my collegiate career, I’ve been having more issues. 
I ran a marathon in the fall, albeit virtual, but I barely slept the night before. It was weird, I didn’t feel insanely nervous or anything, I just couldn’t get myself to calm down for the life of me. Thankfully that race ended up going fine and I moved on. 
Flash forward to a couple weeks ago and I’m ready to do my first “real” race since the pandemic. It was on a Sunday morning, and both Friday and Saturday nights were absolutely atrocious nights of sleep. The melatonin did nothing. Again, my racing was fine but I know that going forward with races, this isn’t sustainable.
I just find it odd that this issue is happening NOW. In the time where I’m not running for team points, National spots, etc, I feel as though I just can’t get myself to relax before these races. I definitely don’t feel pressure around racing these days. I wouldn’t even say l’m jittery or overly nervous going into bed either. For the half a couple weeks ago, I felt calmly confident that entire day, but once I got into bed, something just got my engine revving.

Again, I’m trying to be careful about how I word this. I’m not looking for a diagnosis. More so, is this just a mental game I’m playing with myself? Is it more common to have these issues post-collegiately? Would appreciate any help.",1620059159

## Training

Coming off running 5:03 at Tunnel Hill 50 last fall, I took a full week off and emerged incredibly unscathed. My first few runs back were almost too good to be true - I recovered incredibly quickly and felt like I had retained most of the fitness from the huge cycle I put in leading up to the race. My excitement was quickly squashed after a freak accident rounding a blind corner on my third or fourth run back, though, when I ran into another runner and banged knees.  He (and his pup) were just fine, but something about the angle of the collision messed my knee up and put me out for another 2-3 weeks.

Tunnel Hill was mid November 2020 - between my intentional time off and forced lay-off from the run-in, it was late January 2021 before I was running anything approaching normal mileage again. With the delay in training, I wasn’t even sure I wanted to commit to a spring race. Once I worked back up to normal mileage again and peeked at the calendar, everything was uncomfortably close and would require a really abbreviated cycle.

After talking with my coach, I figured the 12 weeks to Strolling Jim would be the bare minimum to get fit enough to take a crack at the course record. [I had taken a swing (and a miss) at the record in 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/bl2toj/412_miles_at_600_pace_strolling_jim_1st/) at the end of a season focused on much shorter races, but this time I wanted to attack the race correctly and put all my effort into challenging the 30 year-old course record set by Andy Jones in 1991. His 3:59:26 (5:48/mile over 41+ miles of hilly middle Tennessee) is widely considered one of the toughest course records in the sport of ultra marathoning.

My biggest mistake in 2019 at Strolling Jim was going into the race without the specific fitness I needed to realistically run sub-4. [My splits from that year tell the story](https://www.strava.com/activities/2341538152/overview) \- I was absolute toast after 50k. This time around, I wanted to make sure I was specifically fine-tuned to race 41+ miles well under 6:00/mile pace over the hilly back roads of Tennessee. So, I started going out to Todds Road Stumblers runs just outside of Lexington, KY for long runs almost every Saturday morning. This storied club was the [home of Mark Nenow when he ran the road 10k world record in 1984](http://www.toddsroadstumblers.com/milemarker4.pdf) and has brutal routes with names like “Pitbull.” The terrain around Todds road is perfect training ground for Strolling Jim (read: hilly). The first day I went out to run at Todds Road and said I was racing Strolling Jim, I was told of the “incredible course record some Canadian fellow” had set in the 90’s down there. I replied that I was pretty familiar with the incredible record Andy Jones had at the race...

Other than the hilly long runs, this cycle was the first time I incorporated back-to-back long run weekends into my training. I loosely follow a “1 up, 1 down” weekly long run schedule - one week would be a really quality weekend long run stimulus (30 at 5:50, back-to-back 20’s at 5:50, etc.) with the next week just consisting of a single, normal 18-22 mile long run right around 6:00 pace. My coach also wove weekday semi-long run workouts incorporating hilly threshold miles around 5:15-20 pace into the cycle, doing either 1 or 2 sessions per week depending on how demanding the weekend long run was. My mileage was only in the 90-110 mi/week range, but the types of quality miles I was running was all designed to optimize fitness for the type of running I’d be doing at Strolling Jim.

You can see my full training in detail [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17080027/training/log).

## Pre-race

My tried and trusted crew were all able to join me again for this race. My mom and aunt along with my friends Sam and Dustin crewed for me at Tunnel Hill and all agreed to come back for more stupidity at Strolling Jim. Sam and Dustin had been instrumental in crewing my 2019 race, so I knew they’d be well prepared to follow me around the course (with no cell reception in parts) and make sure I was able to get the fluids and 300+ calories/hour I’d need to grab in full stride. Running 41 miles in under 4 hours doesn’t leave time for stopping at aid stations to refill bottles and grab fresh nutrition.

The morning of the race, I ate my traditional brown sugar cinnamon Poptarts along with 2 cups of coffee. Headed to the start line I was weirdly nervous. I usually only get nervous for races 10k and down. I made a point to calm myself on the drive to the race - I was fit and knew I had done the work to run well. All I had to do was go out and put the fitness I had built over the past 3 months to work.

## Race

The big wildcard with Strolling Jim is always the weather. Early May in Middle Tennessee can bring anything from snow to 100 degree weather. In 2019, I was lucky enough to run through a beautiful morning, an hour of thunderstorms, and a steamy final 2 hours once the rain stopped and the sun came out. This year, the ultra marathoning gods cooperated and the runners at Jim were treated to a 50 degree, cool, calm, sunny day at the start line. Over the next 4 hours, the temperature was only supposed to rise into the low 70’s.

The race went off and I took the lead almost immediately. I was eager to put the start behind me and focus on finding the appropriate 40+ mile rhythm I’d need to hold for the next 4 hours. While I quickly found the appropriate pace (according to my watch), I was struggling to find the appropriate effort and rhythm through the early miles. I was not hurting or laboring in the slightest to run the early 5:40-50 miles, but I did not feel at all smooth doing it. At Tunnel Hill 50 last fall, the first 20 miles floated by like a breeze on the pancake flat rail trail. This was different. This was Jim. With the constant climbing and descending, it’s tough to find a rhythm.

Even now just a day later, my memories of the early miles are spotty and are comprised of little bits here and there - a beautiful sunrise over a hill...a vibrant yellow field...miniature horses scampering alongside me for a few seconds...a white peacock? “That’s an odd thing to see in the middle-of-nowhere Tennessee. Am I already imagining things?  Oh look! The first ‘not a hill’ hill. I remember this from 2019! Shift into low gear and just get up the sucker…” \*\*Legs spin, I get to the top and careen down the other side**\*\*** “Wow, that was much less of an event than I remember it being in 2019!” I put down a Gu and washed it down with Sword sports drink. I wanted to start fueling early and often.

The first 5 miles took a strangely long time to pass, but I eventually made it to my first mental checkpoint at mile 5 in 28:30. Laz (of Barkley marathon fame) read out my time and wrote it on some paper he had with him. “Wow. Major 2019 Deja Vu.” It’s funny how you can not consciously remember tiny details of a specific experience, but in the right context they all come flooding back.

I was little slower through 5 miles than in 2019, but that was ok...I knew I had gone out too fast last time around. It was already warming up so I [tossed my singlet](https://imgur.com/TBRRIOo) to my crew and grabbed a replacement bottle. My crew went nuts. I just secretly hoped I was going to have a good day and didn’t have them all drive down here for nothing. It was still too early to tell how things were going to go…

I distinctly remember the downhill just after mile 5 being the spot I finally found my groove in 2019. Things immediately started to click and the miles started to melt away. That didn’t happen this time around. I was hoping something would begin to shift my perception of effort from “easy but not smooth” to “smooth and effortless.” No such change happened and the pace continued to feel easy but awkward.

When I pressed the gas just a little on some of the smaller climbs, I noticed that my marathon instincts started to come out. I would start to press just a little and a bit of rhythm started to enter my stride. Inevitably, though, I’d realize the effort was inappropriately hard and I needed to back off. Back to the awkward, uncomfortable in-between pace, I guess. I almost welcomed the first big climb leading into mile 10 as an opportunity to hopefully jolt me into a solid groove.

The first big climb of the race loomed, and I once again just shifted into low gear and turned my brain off. No watch-peeking allowed the next half mile. What good would that do? I allowed my legs to find threshold effort and just [spun my way up](https://imgur.com/E8e3eFn)….and up...and up...and uuuppppp…..and finally over the top of the steep climb. At the top I focused on flushing my legs and allowing them to work back to sub-6 pace on their own terms. I swapped my bottle with my crew again and got a 10 mile split from Laz. I knew a big, long downhill was coming up and I was determined to make up for some lost time on it.

The 11th mile of the race loses 215 feet of elevation. That’s not too extreme for a trail race, but in the road world that basically means you’re careening off a mountain. I focused on finding the happy medium of taking advantage of the free time vs. running too hard and trashing my quads. I think I struck the balance perfectly and the result was a 5:26 11th mile. “Only 30 miles to go. Now just get to the half marathon mark and from there it’s basically just a marathon left. Sort of. Wait a minute, am I already bargaining with myself? What’s that niggle of pain in my left glute? And why are my legs suddenly feeling heavy? Ugh, I’m already going back up hill again.”

[I swapped my bottle once again](https://imgur.com/5OUVn9q) with my crew at the half marathon mark. I remembered feeling invincible at this point in 2019. Today, though, I still felt awkward. I couldn’t find any sort of rhythm for more than a minute or two at a time. My legs were going through spurts of feeling weirdly heavy. I noticed the 35 mile mark upside down from my point of view and sort of laughed at myself that I wouldn’t see it right-side-up for another 2 hours.

I continued to slog through the miles with no sense of rhythm to the 15 mile mark. I swapped bottles again and [Laz read off 1:25:56](https://imgur.com/ZZRKza4). About 45 seconds slower than I was in 2019. Last time around, this was the spot the rain was coming down and I threw my bottle to my crew to run without it for a few miles because I felt so good - I had attacked the next 5 miles like a man possessed in 2019. Whatever magic I had uncovered last time around at this point of the race was nowhere to be found this year.  I continued to slog….not uncomfortable, but not thriving. My left glute was a little wonky. My legs gave me moments of concern because they’d suddenly feel heavy. “This is madness….25 miles to go and I already have these thoughts? I should be thriving at this point. Today must not be my day. I wonder if I’m low key sick or something right now?”

I put my doubts to rest and continued to attack the course one mile at a time. I still couldn’t find any rhythm, but I could control my effort. Ease off up the hills, let loose a little down the hills. Rinse, repeat. I knew I was in for some of the nastiest terrain of the race over the next few miles, so I focused on moving forward with as little effort as possible. The splits were good, but I still was not comfortable doing it.

The second hill eventually loomed. I swapped my bottle again and started up the monster. I once again instituted my “no peeking at the watch” rule and shifted my legs into low gear. Find threshold effort...no other thoughts allowed. I reached the top surprisingly well and careened down the otherside of the second beast. Laz called out my 20 mile split as 1:53:51. Still about 40 seconds behind 2019 pace, but I was starting to find some groove. The downhill felt great and I hit the halfway point well under record pace. I was excited that things were starting to feel good, but I knew the nastiest climb of the race known as Hilltop still loomed just ahead. I saw “Bad Thing Ahead”  scrawled on the road and steeled myself for a miserable next couple miles.

The anticipation leading into the Hilltop climb was perhaps worse than the climb itself. While I had run the race before, I didn’t exactly remember where the beast lurked on the course. I kept expecting it to appear around every corner. Eventually, I spotted my crew once again and just beyond them the start of what was unmistakably the bottom of the infamous hilltop climb. A cyclist zoomed past without a word. I once again swapped my bottle with my crew and mentally bucked in for the toughest half mile of the race yet.

My legs hit threshold effort and I just left them there. No watch-peeking allowed. I slowly started to [catch the cyclist](https://imgur.com/HYfUiQ6) who was crawling up the hill. Eventually, I passed him and he seemed a little baffled that I had caught up to him, but the hill was far from over. Up...and up...and up...still going up??...until finally I could see Laz posted at the top. I knew from 2019 that he made it a point to sit at the top, so I took the sight of him as confirmation that I was indeed over the worst of it. I let out a few audible swears back at the hill as I summited and heard Laz yell to me that I’d just hit the high point of the race. From here there was some great, downhill running to be had for the next few miles.

Running downhill on the other side of Hilltop I suddenly found a sense of calm and flow. My crew zoomed past in the car and yelled for me. Laz followed shortly behind in his same old beat up red sedan that I remember from 2019. The rhythm I had desperately been looking for all day was suddenly, magically there. I immediately felt cocky. I suddenly felt so strong it scared me. I guess it just took the first 23 miles and a massive climb to finally get all systems properly warmed up and firing. “It’s about goddamn time” I thought to myself. “It only took 24 miles.”

Mile 25 was downhill and clicked past without a thought in 5:25. I was distinctly aware of the fact that I was consciously holding back a gear I had in the bank. A more immature version of ultrarunning-self would have let that gear go as the years of racing the marathon and shorter has taught me to do. But I knew there were some brutal miles yet to come and that any bit I didn’t lay on the line now would come in handy later. So, I just let myself ride down the long hill once notch removed from what I knew I could do. I continued to sip on my Sword and put down my Gu knowing I’d start to run low on glycogen stores soon. I hit the [marathon split](https://imgur.com/d4d3aMz) with Laz and my crew on-site in 2:28 high - a new split record.

Finally, I was faster than I was in 2019. More importantly, I felt infinitely stronger than I did at this point in 2019. “In fact,” I mused, as mile 28 clicked off at 5:35, “I feel better now than I did at mile 5 of this thing.” Excitement started to creep in. “I think I can actually do this thing.” I tempered the rising excitement and reminded myself there was still well over an hour of running left. Ultras can be cruel and turn on a dime if you’re not careful. So, I made it a point to stay as relaxed as I possibly could while the going was so good. Anything I can save now will come in handy later...

When I made the turn into the infamous “Walls,” I knew I was in a much better spot than I was in 2019. I swapped my bottle with my crew again and drew some energy from their cheers. My overall pace to this point in the race was pretty similar to 2019, but this time around I was still feeling strong enough to aggressively attack this brutal section of the course. While no climbs are as tough as Hilltop, the “Walls” consist of one super steep climb and descent after the next. Forget finding a rhythm. I knew I had to constantly switch between my climbing legs and descending legs if I wanted to keep any sort of decent pace over the next few miles. As I attacked one hill after another, I was shocked and surprised at how well my pace was holding up. Excitement and cockiness started to creep back in…

As I rounded the top of yet another hill and approached the 50k split, I could see my crew and Laz waiting for me. I dumped the remaining water in my bottle over my head and grabbed a fresh one from my crew. [Laz read out my time as 2:56:xx](https://imgur.com/CM7Tt6D), faster than the 2:57 Andy Jones had set 30 years prior. I started down the other side of the hill and felt invincible. The course record was done for...I was sure of it. In 2019, I was a crumpled mess at 50k. This year, I felt like I was just getting started. 10 miles to go and I didn’t even have to keep 6 minute pace to get home in time…

Mile 32 blew by downhill in 5:36. I still felt great and started fantasizing about how much I could squeeze out of the last 10 miles. Slowly, though, the roll started to slow and the effort got harder. I developed a bit of a side stitch from abusively careening down all the hills. I was still taking in plenty of fluids and nutrition, but I could tell the inevitable glycogen bonk was drawing ever closer. My mindset shifted from attacking the last 9 miles to surviving the last 9 miles in a matter of minutes.

I bargained with myself to just make it to that 35 mile mark I had noted a lifetime ago. Once I was there, I would give my permission to start thinking about the finish. Until then, though,  I was just focused on holding pace to that mile marker. My perceived effort continued to increase and the notion of running another 8+ miles started to get more and more scary.

Shockingly, despite the effort growing harder and harder, my pace wasn’t faltering. Fear was creeping in more and more every moment, but my pace continued to hold at or just under 6:00 pace. When I have had this same subjective experience in previous ultras, my pace historically begins to slip. Today seemed to be different, though. Effort was increasing, but my pace was holding steady. I told myself I physically had what it took to get to the line under the record...I just had to have the mental resolve to allow that performance to manifest over these final few miles.

Agonizingly slowly, [I approached the 35 mile mark](https://imgur.com/thc3Ygx). Laz called out my time, but I didn’t hear it - I knew I was ahead of pace but didn’t want to expend the energy to think about by how much. I swapped my bottle again and my crew went nuts. They screamed I was almost there and had time to spare. Based on how things were going, it was almost a guarantee I’d be able to get home on time, but the notion of 35 more minutes on these lead legs with scary waves of fatigue was daunting. I turned my brain off, sipped on my Sword, forced myself to take another Gu, and kept on running. My pace was holding steady well under 6:00 miles.

The fear that my legs could stop working at any moment never left. From 35 to 37 I ran well under 6 minute pace, but it doesn’t tell the story of the fear I was dealing with. One step at a time I did my best to quell the negative thoughts and remain in the moment. At this very moment I knew I was still able to run under 6:00 pace, and for the moment that’s all that mattered. Deal with the remaining 4 miles later…I swapped my bottle with my crew at 37 and again at 39. I don’t know if I physically needed all that, but having the mental checkpoints was absolutely crucial that late in the race.

After my last bottle swap with my crew at mile 39, they zipped past on the main road back to town and went a little extra crazy for me. Logically, I knew there was no way I wouldn’t get home under the record. I had over 16 minutes to cover the last 2 miles and, despite the fear and fatigue that had plagued me since mile 33, I had shown no sign of deviating much above my 6:00 pace baseline. Emotionally, though, I didn’t trust that I’d get back under the record just yet. The tenths of a mile clicked past agonizingly slowly, and I focused on a building off in the distance I thought marked the finish line. As I got closer I was wrong - it marked a half mile from the finish line.

Despite feeling like it would never draw near, the finish finally did actually materialize. With 200 meters to go, I suddenly felt new life in my legs and let myself let go of the fear I had been harboring for hours. I finally let myself get excited in the knowledge that I was going to break the record. The final 200 meters felt effortless, and I let out a jubilant fist pump across the line as the emotion of the last hours, months, and years surrounding this record finally came to the surface. My 3:55:44 was almost 4 minutes under the previous record for the course.

As I came to a stop, my body took it as permission to shut down. I suddenly knew that I was about to crumble in the middle of a group of cheering spectators, crew, and race staff. A kind bystander caught me and guided me to an empty lawn chair. He made sure my jello legs safely found the seat because at this point they were basically useless. He was wearing a grey “sub 4” Strolling Jim shirt, put a medal on me, and as soon as I had my wits about me, [introduced himself as Andy Jones](https://imgur.com/j1Pxj5B).

I had obsessed over this record for years and just raced the ghost of this man for 4 hours, and here he was to congratulate me on breaking his unbreakable course record. It was a special moment, and I made sure to tell him that the standard he set brought out more than the best in myself. Had he not redefined what was possible and run sub-4 all those years ago, I doubt I would have ever believed it was possible for me.

I made it a point to ask if he had a crew for his sub 4 run all those years ago. He smiled and pointed to his buddy standing next to him who said he had spent years crewing all his crazy, legendary races. I took a look at my [happy crew of misfit toys](https://imgur.com/5DHs2dw) and smiled at the thought that we’d still be stuck with one another in 30 years’ time.

Andy said the whole day brought back some great memories of his years running ultras, and I took a moment to reflect on what a great moment this was in this crazy, special sport of ours. The shoes and nutrition and media surrounding the sport has changed drastically over the past 30 years, but the inherent goodness that lies at its core is still as pure as it has ever been.

## Post-race

Reflecting on my performance at Strolling Jim this year, the thing that stands out the most to me is not necessarily the record. What I’m most proud of is that I didn’t give up on myself. Early in the race, I honestly doubted I had anything special in my legs for the day. I put those fears to rest and just clicked the miles off one at a time. Eventually, the fitness I knew I had in my legs began to come out, and I was able to use it to push to the line under Andy’s record.

While the big performances at their races get most of the attention, [Laz and Steve Durbin](https://imgur.com/Puf6mTk) are the unsung heroes of not just this event, but for the sport (especially in this region) in general. The support and passion they bring to this space has helped elevate the crazy, niche world of ultra running into what it is today. I have nothing but respect for the two of them, so I was proud to be able to put together a memorable performance at their event after such a tough year for the racing world.

Having seen the entire history of this race first hand, Laz has a unique perspective on my race. He wrote a rather poetic reflection of his experience of the day, and I’d like to leave this (long) recap with it:

my observations from the lead car: this is not zack's first attempt to knock off andy's record. he already had run the second fastest time ever. yesterday he took 12 minutes off that time.

last year he ran a 5:03 at the tunnel hill fifty mile. it is impossible not to anticipate seeing what his potential is at that distance, and at 100km.

andy jones himself was there. apparently he had been following zack, and felt like this was the guy who would finally break the record from perhaps his greatest performance. it was really touching to see the only two sub 4 runners in 43 years of the jim sharing a private moment. (wouldnt we all like to know what secrets they shared!)

it was a privilege to get to watch zack assault the course. every runner has their own style. 30 years ago andy sliced thru the air like an arrow. his feet seemed to barely touch the ground, and he went up the hills like they were not even there.

zack attacked the course from the gun and kept up the assault with the tenacity of a bulldog. his style reminded me of a charlie trayer or tom zimmerman. i watched him take on that beast of a climb at hilltop (about 23 miles into the race) you get a good read on a runner by how they handle that nasty half mile monster and i am pretty sure i heard him swearing at it as he went past.

the walls (between 29 and 34 miles) make or break racers​ at the jim. when zack went thru the 50km split (2:56) you could see he was hurting. but he did not let up the intensity one bit. it was between 50km and the finish that he blew the record away. i hope i am lucky enough to see him lock horns with some of the other super fast guys. maybe he was only competing with andy's ghost yesterday. but there was no missing the competitive fire that burns in his heart.

i have been lucky enough to see a lot of great performances by a lot of great ultrarunners at a variety of events. yesterday was among the very best.

AdvancedRunning,atomicsf,Best training plan &gt; iOS app &gt; Apple Watch integration?,"I’ve been using Nike Run Club and Strava with the Apple Watch 4 to track my runs for the last two years. I recently added the Polar H10 HRM strap (to get rid of the dropouts that were occurring). 

I’ve hit a bit of a plateau recently and am looking for training plans to help take my running to the next level (half marathon distance and faster) that integrate with my Apple gear. What do you recommend I try or get? 

I’ve looked at training plans like (Run with Hal, VDOT, Training Peaks) or analysis apps like RunAnalyze (and others) and I am not sure what to get. Each seems to do 1-2 things and doesn’t seem to integrate easily. I would appreciate this group’s insights on what to use.

I am a beginner-intermediate runner (15 miles per week, 10:30 pace; age 56; weight 152 lbs). I am a data geek and have heavily researched form, nutrition, shoes etc and fairly comfortable with those choices. 

I’ve also considered getting a dedicated sports watch (Coros Apex or Garmin 245 or 945) but not sure if those will actually help or if I am just going to get stuck with more tech (I am comfortable with tech but generally have too much of it in my life).

AdvancedRunning,addk,What is my max HR?,"Hey runners!

First of all, I love my data and I hope I won't scare you off as I am looking for some opinions here :).

I've done a Max HR test today (cause I want to do an LT test soon and need it for that, then use LTHR% zones to complement the power (Stryd) based training) HOWEVER, I couldn't push my HR above 182.

I am 31, male, small build: 64kg, 172 cm, and the conditions + test were:

\- 10 Celsius, no wind, 75% humidity  
\- Garmin Fenix 5 watch, HR measured with the Garmin HRM-Run chest strap  
1. 10-minute warmup jog, approx 5:35 min/km  
2. 500m tempo in 4:40 min/km, then transitioned to 3x hill reps  
Hill: 300m which makes it \~1 min reps, 5-10% varying elevation   
R1: 4:05 min/km, max HR 179  
R2: 3:42 min/km, max HR 176  
R3 3:40 min/km, max HR 182  


Additional info: last Sunday had a Half-Marathon and this week I only ran 3 times totalling 25 km and had a 30 km Zwift session on the turbo trainer, otherwise I average about 60km/week with the odd cycling session thrown in.  


Now the 182 max HR seems incredibly low to me and I am not sure if I wasn't working hard enough or the reps were too short, the equipment didn't do its job or this is just my max HR. Of course, I understand no field test will ever come close to the accuracy of a lab test, but here is my problem:

Based on the well-known formulas (220-age or 211 - 0.64 X age) all predict a max HR of \~190. I know a field test is more reliable as we not all the same, so here is another contradiction:

Since I have my chest strap (2019), I only used it a few times as it's very uncomfortable. From those few times, only a handful was high intensity so omitting 1-2, here are the others:

1. 2019 January: 5k park run, no wind, about 98% effort with an all in hill(!) finish. Consistent heart rate throughout, but peaked during the hill sprint at 192 BPM.
2. 2020 November: Jim Vance's running power test (15min warm-up, 3 min hard, 5 min walk 10 min easy 5 min walk 5 min easy 5 min walk 9 min hard 15 min cooldown), peaked on 190 BPM

Considering all this, I am leaning towards saying my Max HR is \~190 BPM, but today's 182 made me think. In the past few months, I wasn't really paying attention to my HR stats as I was training with power, haven't used the chest strap and my Garmin wrist sensor is always inaccurate.

What do you guys think whats my max HR based on the above?",1619985645

**Training**

I followed the higher running (formerly sage running) intermediate half training plan, which is 12 weeks long and mostly hovers around 45-55 mpw after a quick buildup. I followed it down to the letter, sticking to the mid-high mileage ranges, the only deviation was I switched a workout and easy run one day to avoid snow. Overall I felt a lot better this training cycle than in the fall, after a little relaxed basebuilding to heal up some niggles.

About half the workouts throughout the plan are based on lactate threshold, and the other half starts out as a mixture and then switches to focus on \~5km pace stuff in the last few weeks. The longest long runs were around 15-16mi but most of them were more like 11-14. The only hm goal pace work was 3mi at the end of an 11mi long run in week 3 (which I did at \~6:55 pace and felt great) and 2x3mi at goal pace in week 8 (which I did at 6:55, 6:59 pace and felt horrible, brushed it off as feeling sick and tired from peak mileage).

Based on how I felt during the LT stuff (which I did around 6:45 pace) I felt that 1:32 was a pretty solid goal and would be achievable on a good day, but really wanted 1:29:xx so still held out a little hope for that.

**Pre-race**

Drove to valley forge to run on the schuylkill river trail, jogged and did some strides, feeling really bouncy and fresh after the taper (which I didn't feel bouncy or strong during lol). It was like 63F, sunny, and humid at 8:30, and would get to 73ish at the finish, which I was really worried about since almost all my workouts and long runs have been like 35-45F. Because of that I decided to run by feel and give myself some slack, targeting \~7:10 pace effort for the first few miles and then gradually working down if it felt alright (narrator: it did not feel alright)

**Race**

Took a gel and was off, feeling great the first 2 miles but well behind pace. I think the watch was telling me these were like 7:40 or something at the time which was obviously wrong but not as wrong as I was hoping lol. By the third mile I was already sweating a ton and getting pretty hot and realized I was just going to be hanging on to this pace the rest of the time, which sucked - it's not fun knowing you aren't going to make a goal 1/4 of the way in lol.

Spent a while roasting in the sun and trying to relax but by mile 7-8 I was in bad shape and really wanted to stop. Just kept telling myself to make it to 10mi before quitting. When I reached the second turnaround shortly after 11mi I walked for 20s to drink some more water and spray it on my head which helped a lot, it felt like 90 degrees even though it was a beautiful spring morning. Got back on the pace and just gritted through the last couple miles, finally getting down to my original goal pace at the end haha.

**Post-race**

Walked/jogged about a mile back to the car, drank a protein smoothie thing and cracked open a beer to drown my sorrows. Ate some other stuff too then went for a short walk in the woods feeling a little stiff but surprisingly good. Its now 2pm and I still feel a lot better than expected, legs obv a little tired but not exhausted. I've felt worse after long run workouts. We'll see how that changes next morning haha

**Reflections**

Missed my goals by a longshot but still really proud of the pacing by effort I did and hanging on even though it was very difficult and I already blew it. Wasn't the result I wanted but dropped my 10mi pr from 1:14 in sept 2020 to 1:12, and hm pr from 1:43 in november 2019. I still think I could run it at 7 min/mi pace if it was 50F and cloudy and a real race but thats probably just wishful thinking.

I think the point of having a bunch of vo2 max stuff at the end of the training plan is to make hm pace feel easier right? It sorta worked but I feel like my aerobic endurance is really lacking since I pretty much never do faster steady long runs or long tempos, just a lot of super easy running and LT/5k pace stuff. I also wish there was some more hm pace running in the training plan if for no other reason then getting to play around with it to mentally figure it out.

My plan now is a week off from running, then spending the next few months basebuilding and working in some longer tempos and faster long runs to work on that endurance. Im signed up for the philly marathon in november, so I'll just prepare as if it is going to happen (fingers crossed). Also excited to do some more cycling and trail running :) Does anyone have any suggestions for a marathon plan to follow in the 50-60mi range? Thinking of buying Daniels or Pfitz's books and trying one of them out but not sure.",1619979885
AdvancedRunning,nicogno_,Pftizinger 10k plan HR- vs Pace-based training,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently training for a 10k at the end of May (M26, aiming for a time between 37:00 and 37:30, my current PR is 38:20) and following the Pfitzinger base plan (first time following a plan). At the beginning I used to run the endurance runs around 4’30”/km, as the book “Faster road racing” suggests, but after a few weeks in I bought a Polar H10 chest strap and started trying to base my pace on HR zones. I assumed my max HR was 194 (using 220-26) and started running my endurance runs between 155 BPM and 160 BPM (79%-82% HRmax), which translated to a 4’10”/km on average.
Yesterday I run a 5k TT (I used it as a tune-up race) and averaged 3’35”/km, with an HRmax of 180 BPM (it was pretty much an all-out effort).
Now, here are my questions: 180 seems way lower than 194 BPM, should I assume that my HRmax is lower than 194? Can my HRmax be estimated from a 5k effort? Should I go back to the old slower pace, or is it ok to follow the HR zones to establish the endurance pace?

I kept wondering how many of you run with orthopedic inlays.

However as result I have problem fitting in running shoes and the inlays seems to be pretts wide. So any one have the same problem? How many of you have inlays?

**Background**:

I don't have a lot to say here but here's the important details: I'm a 22 y.o. grad student who, in High School, ran XC/Track for just one year after being cut from my soccer team. My 5K PR was 18:30 (nothing wrong with that but I had higher aspirations) but I fell in love with the sport. I took a year off from running in freshman year of undergrad and then by sophomore year I set a lofty goal for myself - to run a sub-16 5K by the time I graduated college, and eventually, a sub-15 (no timeline for that but *it will happen*). I didn't accomplish my first goal but I ran a 16:46 in my junior year. Unfortunately, I spent most of senior year - and most recently most of November and December - in and out of injury. By the time I left undergrad, I wanted more but it wasn't easy getting back to where I was. Eventually, things started coming together.

**Training**:

Pretty much all of my workouts are on my Strava, but generally there were three (and a half) main kinds I was doing in the last 12 weeks. The first were long runs that progressed into tempo/threshold territory in the last 2-4 miles; the best example was a 14-miler at 6:30 pace this last Sunday where the last two miles of the progression (11th and 12th) were 5:43 and 5:22 respectively. The second was the core of my work: Threshold mile repeats that eventually became closer to race pace (think like 3-4 repeats where the last mile dips below 5:20 or even 5:10; with some strides at the end). The last were mile-paced 200s and 400s anywhere from 4:20-4:45 pace to work on turnover. Mileage was an average of 65-70/week with a peak of 76. Been building up since late January after biking through an injury.

**Race**:

What do people put here? I just ran and felt afraid I was going too slow the whole time - that's all a time trial is, baby. I just went, checking my watch for pace as often as possible (once a lap, sometimes every 200). My pace was a positive split (see above) but overall nothing drastic - and frankly I think with competitors I'd have closed a little stronger.

What I will add is the bad and the good of the race. The *bad* was the fact that there were people at the local track (there was a baseball game going on) and some folks don't respect the rules of the lane. I spent more time in lane 2 than I wanted to, but I wasn't gonna let that get to me. I also want to point out that for the most part the little kids were way more respectful of the Track rules than any damn adult. Shameful. Also, this track is oddly shaped but still 400m thankfully.

The *good* was the weather - 67 degrees with a light breeze and pretty shady. Shoes also felt great - I definitely recommend the Skechers Horizon Vanish for anyone like me who is a big baby and doesn't like spikes for anything longer than 2 miles. The *best* thing, though, was that because this was a TT, I could pick the music - and I have a few race-focused playlists just for times like these.

The songs that took me to my PR were:

* ""Running Up That Hill"" - Kate Bush
* ""Born to Run"" - Bruce Springsteen
* ""Race for the Prize"" - The Flaming Lips
* ""Next Level Charli"" - Charli XCX

I recommend these songs highly, and I love them even more after today.

**What's Next?**

In the immediate future, I plan to do a few more TTs into June - mostly Miles, 3Ks, and maybe another 5000m with a little more tapering, with more intense workouts preceding them (more 1K repeats for sure). Then, next cycle will start in late July / early August with a focus on just the 5K, with the goal being to find a road race or open track meet and make my PR official.

I’ll be moving to the Texas hill country in June. while I am excited, I am also nervous for the hills haha, I’ve never really had to deal with actual hills during my runs and usually only ever see 100ft of elevation change in a run. 

Now I know Strava has the ability with its premium features to adjust your pace to the grade. Is this a useful feature for anyone who uses it? Or am I just better off knowing my pace is going to tank for a good bit? 

Also does anyone have any suggestions to work some of these “hill muscles” for the time being without necessarily a hill. Any input is appreciated",1619931823

The running part I can handle, but I'm so confused with strength training. More I google around, more I get confused. I'd be supper happy for any suggestions. I want to keep this as simple as possible, so my specs for the 8 weeks are:

* Two sessions per week
* Only one main exercise: squat
* Max strength only, no mass, so low reps (I guess?)

I believe I have pretty good technique in squatting. The problem is that I have no idea of what to do. Usually I just hit some 3x10 with some nice weight, but that's it. I feel there's no progression. Please help suggesting me some simple 8 week program!",1619930035

AdvancedRunning,CadavreContent,Can't run for the next month or two,"I started feeling a mild pain in my lower outside leg while running about two weeks ago. It would only really be noticeable while warming up and then almost fully subside. A few days ago, I decided that it had been long enough with no improvement, especially when it started to linger a bit longer even through the main part of my runs. I went to a doctor, and after an MRI scan, it turned out that my leg was literally on the verge of cracking in two different spots...

So now my doctor told me not to run and even minimise any kind of weight put on my leg for the next 6-8 weeks while healing so as to avoid a stress fracture. What would you recommend for me to do to maintain as much of my running fitness as possible during this period? I was advised against biking, and while swimming/underwater running would be an option, gyms are currently closed where I live.

AdvancedRunning,70cast,Race Equivalency,"  

I’m reading Pfritz’s faster road racing but haven't yet found the answer to this question. 

Saturday I ran a 5K at about 90% effort with a 6:55 pace.  Yesterday I went for an easy run of 10 miles with 7:43 pace. The last 5K was about 7:25 pace but still taking it fairly easy. This is pretty common for me, I can do easy distance but man… I can’t take on any speed. I say it was fairly easy because I didn’t feel much fatigue but also didn’t feel like I could pick up the pace much if I was racing. A mile TT is currently about 6:30 and I feel the same. For pace equivalency I used: [https://lukehumphreyrunning.com/hmmcalculator/race\_equivalency\_calculator.php](https://lukehumphreyrunning.com/hmmcalculator/race_equivalency_calculator.php)

It seems to me I’m under pace on short distances and/or over on long distance. 

Running has been a big part of my life for decades, I just love it. However, lately I’m ramping up my mileage and trying to set some PRs! It’s been super fun but just wondering why I can’t do faster speeds. 

My theories:

1) Need more VO2 Max and LT workouts since I just started doing these. Contrary, I’ve been running easy miles for years. 

2) Race anxiety. In a 5K event, I feel like I should be able to push it harder but also feel sluggish. 

3) Mental toughness.  I’ve come to believe that racing speed and mental toughness is like a muscle and since I haven’t done it in a long time I need to build this back up so I can push it to a higher level. I’m doing some 5Ks this year and a marathon in Sept. I hope to PR both in the next year or two.

### Training
Following CIM 2019 where I ran a 2:24 going for the moonshot OTQ attempt (1:09/1:15 halves), I was hoping to train for Boston 2021 which obviously did not happen due to the Coronavirus Pandemic we have found ourselves in for around 13 months now.

During 2020 I still ended up running around 4500 miles with only 2-3 weeks training missed due to an injury and got to do some fun TT's as well as a couple ultra distance runs, culminating in a 47 mile FKT in December. 

Entering 2021, I figured there would be an opportunity to race a marathon for me, especially given my relatively early vaccination through work. In January I decided to aim for the Glass City marathon, given it was a few months off (which I was hopeful would be enough for vaccinations to ramp up and lower numbers to a point where races could occur). After previously using Pfitzinger marathon plans and some home made hybrid training plans, I ended up landing on Jack Daniels 2Q training to try something new this cycle.

Entering the training cycle I figured 2:20 would be a reasonable target with 16 weeks to train hard. I kept things relatively simple, averaging around 100 miles per week with two workouts and a couple days where I added strides in with mostly easy running otherwise.

I have to say that I really enjoyed the 2Q style of training, but the workouts were definitely demanding and required lots of recovery, usually at least 2-3 days between each quality session. Some of my best sessions included a 10 mile flat tempo at Threshold where I ran it in 50:53, a few 4,3,2,1 mile threshold workouts, some longer marathon pace/ threshold workouts such as the 8M,1T,4M,1T,1M and the 5M, 4M, 3T, 2T, 1T. Additionally I hopped in a trail 50k which I won in 3:27 in early March, as well as a Half marathon in late March I won in 1:08:09 on a very tough/hilly course.

The half marathon result gave me confidence that I was in shape to run right around a 2:20 flat as my perception was that I could have run a 1:06 high on a flat/fast course.

### Pre Race
After some research on the runners in the elite field in the race, I found that there were runners with PRs of 2:17, 2:18, 2:20, and 2:22. I figured it would be between me and these guys for the win and the best approach would be to forget about times and just focus on pure racing for the win. I also figured, the course record just under 2:21 would be very much in play if I went for that strategy.

### Race

The race started off and quickly it got down to a pack of 4 runners including myself within the first few miles. I found myself in the front a decent portion and decided it wouldn't be smart to be the one getting drafted on the whole time so ended up ceding the lead for the majority of miles 5-13. We were clicking off some relatively slow miles considering my time goals, many of them were 5:25-5:35 and we weren't being helped by the nature of the course which had lots of turns including a thin bike lane in the park that was really a momentum killer. I tried to just focus on racing for the win and not worrying about that. My breathing felt incredibly easy, like I wasn't even trying hard, but my legs felt oddly stiff and uncomfortable.

We hit the half marathon mark somewhere between 1:11:40-45, on pace for a 2:23 mid, well behind the course record mark, but nothing to be done about that.

My stomach was already starting to feel slightly off as I ate some of my 3rd gel around mile 15 when I started to choke and then dry heave loudly. One of the guys asked if I was okay, to which I responded ""just choking, all good"" and then he took that as cue to take off and lay down the first big surge of the race. Immediately our pack of 4 splintered and I found myself dry heaving and as far as 5-10 seconds back. Fortunately after slowing down for a little bit, my heart rate got under control and I felt better. Then I got to work closing down the gap. I passed one runner and then latched onto second place who was now gaining on the leader. We caught up within a mile or so and probably dropped a 5 flat mile during this stretch to bridge the gap.

Oddly enough around this point at mile 16-17 my legs felt great at this increased pace, with a quicker cadence and more of a focus on the aerobic side I felt really smooth and ready to send the last 10 miles. We kept this higher pace until we reached the park with windy bike paths for a second time, our pace slowed to the 5:30s during this stretch and I knew around mile 20 would be the time for a move. The last 5 miles after this park were basically a straight shot on a wide path back to the finish. 

Then at mile 21 it happened, myself and one other runner who had chased down the leader previously suddenly noticed he was dropping back right before that turn onto the wide path. I told him ""we're dropping him"" and he responded ""let's push, and bring this home together"" which was nice and surprisingly friendly for two guys competing for the win and some prize money. 

We started rolling off miles around and under 5:20, cruising side by side, things were feeling awesome and we were on track for a big negative split. Around mile 23-24 my legs started to feel like they were filling with concrete, I really wish I had been able to take in one more gel, because I could feel that this was the wall of depletion hitting me. I clung on within a few seconds for mile 24 hitting a 5:22, but the gap grew to around 10 seconds by mile 25. The race for the win was over for me, now to just hold on and get as good a time as possible. Mile 25 ended up being a 5:25 and mile 26 a 5:30 with a downhill included where my legs felt like absolute bricks. I was hoping to still salvage a sub 2:22 but ended up short of that goal, finishing in 2:22:12, about 25 seconds back from 1st place.

### Post-race
I finished and chatted with the winner for a couple minutes. I was proud of the race despite my belief that I was in shape for a sub 2:20 or 2:20 flat on the day. It just wasn't the way things played out, especially with a more tactical first 15 miles and lots of momentum killing turns and the occasional breeze. My second half ended up being around a 1:10:40 so a 1 minute negative split was a pretty big achievement for me, as I generally positive split marathons. It really was an incredible experience to purely race a marathon, and this was one of the first where I felt like I was really pushing the pace in the back half and not just hanging on (except the last couple miles). Incredible grateful for the ability and chance to race, and it's not something I will take for granted ever again.

Upon reflection, I think I made all the right moves during the race, my legs just didn't have enough in the last few miles to keep up and compete for the win, so I am 100% satisfied with my performance. I'm hoping to race a bigger marathon in the fall where it will be more of a time trial situation locking into a steady pace group for whatever time the olympic trials qualifying standard is set at!

AdvancedRunning,SpecialFX99,How to run my fastest mile,"**Background:** I'm a 40 y/o male that until this year has been running primarily ultra marathons as my goal races.  This year I've decided to work on the shorter PRs and because of that do more road races.  I recently ran my 5k PR of 19:39.  I haven't ran an all out mile in several years and am hoping to improve that PR, which is 5:56.  That was just in my neighborhood on a whim and not an actual race. I just entered a 1 mile road race coming up in about 5 weeks.  I'm currently running about 40 mpw.  My A goal is to get 5:45 or below and I think that's reasonable based on my recent 5k race times.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not concerned about training to get faster because the race is only 5 weeks away.  I just want to see where I'm at. What I would like advice on is how to prepare to run my best race.  What kind of stretching/warmup is best for a mile race? Is some kind of taper recommended?  Is there a pacing strategy for a distance this short or is it just go all out and try not to die until after you cross the line? Any other advice or encouragement is welcome!",1619801024

My half marathon is at the end of May, so it's in about a month (I'll be fully vaccinated by then...YAY). Today I did a 6.5 mile run at a medium effort (plus 2 miles each for a warmup and cool down). I averaged 7:20 per mile during the 6.5 miles at medium effort, which is honestly much faster than what I thought I was capable of running at that effort! I had a friend bike alongside me the whole time and I talked to her fairly comfortably for a good portion of that 6.5 mile stretch. I definitely felt like I could have gone at least a couple more miles at 7:20 pace, so I'm very curious to see what time I am capable of running for a half marathon. I was originally thinking about shooting for something in the low 1:40 range, but I'm now wondering if I can go faster than that. What do you all think would be a realistic time to shoot for in my half marathon?

Also, I should note that I haven't been specifically training for a half marathon over the past couple of months.

My standard warmup for a workout or a race is \~20 mins of easy jogging followed by 5x100m strides with drills. But if I recall my Pfitzinger correctly, there's a general rule in racing shorter distances that the shorter the distance, the longer the warmup.

### Background

(Fair warning: this is a long post.)

Like a lot of people, the pandemic drove me out from under the weight rack and onto the roads and trails. In April 2020, I threw on some beat-up sneakers and went out for a solo half marathon to celebrate my 34th birthday. It wasn't an especially speedy effort (1:40ish?), but I enjoyed it and it reminded me of a goal I had forgotten about since my twenties: to run a mile in under five minutes.

An aside: I've played ultimate frisbee since high school and in the last 15 years have played at pretty much every level. I've never been the best player, or the most athletic, but I've always worked my ass off on and off the field, including in the gym and on the track. So I'm no stranger to running (kinda) fast. I just never did it for very long.

Anyhow, in the peak frisbee condition of my mid to late twenties, I took a few cracks at the sub-five dream. I came close. Like, agonizingly close. There's a picture that I still have of my old Timex with 5:00:94 on it. Other times I hit 5:05, 5:11, 5:15. Between 2014 and 2017 I probably tried six or seven times, missing by 15 seconds or less each. Eventually I lost motivation or got injured or met a girl or something, and I forgot about it. Life, you know?

Flash forward to 2020 (ugh), post-solo half marathon and halfway through a celebratory pain au chocolat and latte, I realize that the age window for a fast mile was not getting any larger. Given that most other athletic pursuits seemed likely to be off limits for a least a couple months (lol), I decided to commit to training for the mile. Initially, I had no real plan except to go out and run more and more frequently. A friend recommended JD, and I hungrily consumed it and every other piece of running media I could get my hands on, AR included. In retrospect, I recognize now that a new sport to sink hours and hours into (both running and reading about running) was something I needed more than I realized.

Another aside, this one a little sadder: 2020 was a hard year for many reasons (no shit), but for me personally the hardest was the loss of my father. In one of our last few conversations, I remembered telling him about my new obsession with running and my hope of finally getting under five. He smiled (which didn't happen much at that point), and said something like, ""sounds pretty impressive."" After he was gone, I revisited that moment on more than a few hard workouts and on race day. Losing a parent puts some strange ideas in a person's head, and one of mine was that our brief conversation constituted a promise to him that I had to fulfill.

### Training

I started with JD's 1500-2 mi training plan on 30-35 miles a week. I built up through the first phase in spring and summer of 2020, gradually adding more easy days on until I was running five, then six, then sometimes even seven days a week. I picked paces based on my previous 5+ mile PR from five years ago, which is not really recommended. You can probably see where this is going: I got shin splints. 

I had read enough at this point to know how little I wanted them to blossom into a stress fracture, so I took a few days off and invested in my feet. That's right, I got some Hoka Cliftons. I'm convinced they saved my legs, and I've now become such a Hoka shill that I'll buy their shoes for full price and STILL tell you how great they are. But I was still feeling wary of the heavy track load in phase II of JD's plan, so I... restarted phase I. I actually did that a couple more times, not due to injury but for family-related travel that was both unavoidable and especially stressful due to the pandemic (I ended up quarantining twice, having had to go to the states both times).

I couldn't bring myself to race the mile, though. I definitely felt that I was getting quicker, and although my paces had felt uncomfortable initially, I hadn't missed on a single workout and was hitting the shorter distances faster than recommended (old habits die hard). But the failures in my twenties gave me pause, because they had come along with the draining emotional fatigue of knowing that I had tried very, very hard and come up short. I felt at this point that I didn't want to race the mile again until I was damn sure I could do it, even on a bad day. Plus, I had no one to run with. 

This status quo continued until early this year. In February, after considering it for a couple months, I took the plunge and hired a coach through a local running group. I'm going to be a shill again here: having a good coach was *huge* for me. Even though I love learning and thinking about running, I still honestly didn't (and don't) know much, so having someone to thoughtfully program my workouts made a significant difference in my progression.

The two biggest changes to my programming that my coach made were A) pushing my training paces a notch or two higher and B) adding more VO2-max and tempo workouts. In retrospect, it seems obvious that I was plateauing and more in need of endurance than speed, but clearly it wasn't apparent to me at the time. 

It also helped that I made a friend: I happened to mention my training to a friend of a friend with a track background, and he agreed to join and pace me. In the end he ended up running a solid two months of workouts with me, which also dramatically improved the track work. Nothing like some competition and comraderie.

The last problem that my coach solved was my hesitance to commit to a date for the next mile attempt. Almost immediately after we started working together, she put this time trial on the calendar, along with another attempt a month later. She also put the most heinous workout I've ever seen on the calendar, one of those workouts you dread for the whole week and when it shows it up it turns out to be even worse than you thought. The workout:

2 mi @ 5:40/mi, 2 min rest
4 x 200 @ 36, 200 jog rest
3 x 1 mi @ 5:40/mi, 1 min rest
4 x 200 @ 36, 200 jog rest

By the time late April came around, we were hitting paces that indicated 4:50 fitness. Bizarrely, feeling like I had what I needed for sub-five in my legs made me move more cautiously in the world: I worried that if I broke my ankle or something, I might miss my only chance at doing this and regret it for the rest of my life. I imagined (and tried to avoid) an embarrasing number of admittedly unlikely possibilities for injury as race day grew closer.

### Pre-race

Finally, the day of. I slept well two nights before, and poorly the night of. We planned to go around 4:30pm at the local track to hopefully avoid the post-work rush, so I distracted myself with work until then. This turned out to be helpful: obsessing about some work problem right up until the time I had to leave left me with not very much time to be nervous. I ate normal stuff for the most part, although more beans than usual. (That's just a weird detail, not a Chekhov's Beans-type scenario. There will be no further bean references.)

Around 4, I met up with my friend and went for a 20 minute shakeout jog. We got to the track and met with coach there, who had come to watch / motivate / call out splits. Our plan was to aim for 74 on the first lap (including the extra 9 meters), then 74s on laps 2 and 3 before closing it out. I did not want to be a hero today: after all this time, the possibility of going out too hot and crashing in lap 3, Icarus-eat-your-heart-out-style, seemed all too possible. 74s seemed very doable.

After some drills and strides, we were ready to go.

### Race

**Lap 1**: I lined up next to my friend and we took off, me quickly falling in behind him. We have similar builds, which makes it easy to pace off of him, and we settled into what felt like a comfortable pace. But at the same time, something in my body felt strange. I felt both bouncy *and* nervous, and the phrase ""butterflies in my stomach"" suddenly made more sense than it ever had. I wasn't certain what was happening, but I worried that adrenaline was shooting through my system too early in our race. Still, our 200 (209) split was around 35 and the legs felt strong, so I started to settle down and focused on matching the pace.

**Lap 2**: We finished the first lap in 71s, a full three seconds ahead of the plan. I was surprised: it had *felt* like a 74 or slower, and my legs still felt good. The first straightaway had a bit of a headwind, though, and pushing through it the second time to get to 600 was when I first started to feel some fatigue. Someone told me the real mile is between 600 and 1200. I believe them now. We finished lap 3 in 2:24, so something like a 73.

**Lap 3**: In my many failed sub-five attempts, it was always lap 3 that killed me. I think I am not alone here. Lap 1 is usually fine, lap 2 is where the sense of dread starts to creep in, and in lap 3 I would think to myself: ""I'm not sure I can do this"" and pretty soon the wheels were off. So when we started lap 3 I found myself wondering if I would lose the will to hold this pace again today. Not actually feeling the loss of willpower, exactly, but some curiousity about whether that loss would happen. Having a friend to pace really helped at this moment: rather than sinking into potentially disastrous ruminations, I focused on keeping up with him and keeping my legs moving.

It worked. The upwind straight felt hard, but by the time we made it to the 1000 mark I knew we were in good shape. Yes, it was going to suck. But there was no way we were going to drop six seconds over the next 600. The downwind straight brought us through in 3:37, for another 73 split. 

**Lap 4**: I started to feel the elation rising as we rolled into the fourth lap. I knew we had it. The only remaining uncertainty was by how much we would have it. My buddy and I had recently been pushing each other in the last 200s of our workouts, taking 8 or 9 seconds off the paces we were supposed to be hitting. I wasn't sure I felt hopeful or terrified that he might do the same today. Sure enough, he began pushing with around 300 remaining. I couldn't hold it. As we got to the last 200, he had put a good twenty feet between me and him. Dude had abdicated his pacing duties and was full on racing. I was losing it. I couldn't keep up.

But you know, there's something magical that happens in the very last leg of the race. If you've read Endure (Alex Hutchinson), you know that the ability to kick is the best evidence we have that the limits of our endurance are, to some degree at least, as much mental as they are physical. With around 150 meters left, I saw the end of it all coming into clear view. Not only of this race, but of seven years of having this goal tickle the back of my mind, of months of telling people what I was training to do and not knowing if I would ever do it, and of the possibility of not fulfilling my little promise to my dad. That was enough to provide the juice I needed, and I reeled my friend in with 20 left in the last straightaway. We finished together in 4:44, a 16s PB for me.

### Post-race

After collapsing on the grass for a few minutes, we celebrated with some dumb pictures and general congratulations, followed by whole bunch of crappy snacks (think carmel corn chips, chocolate milk, and sugar cookies) and a bottle of wine as the sun went down. What's next? The plan is to complete this mile cycle, and a stretch goal would be to be able to get down into 4:40 range a month from now. I feel like I'm playing with house money at this point, so I'd be happy to go for broke and aim to come through the first three laps in 70s each and then see what's left.

After the mile, I think I'll probably start to work my way up in distance. Turns out that another one of those athletic life goals involved a little race in Boston.

While, yes, many of the low 5 min girl milers are \~115 lbs and taller, there are also some of all different body types who are fast, which is great to see. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I understand that under-fueling is not good for running performance. Yet, I'm also aware that losing a bit of weight (safely) probably can't hurt and will result in better performances. I've always wished to be 120, which is still on the heavier side for distance runners my height, but I have either struggled to lose weight or nearly have gone down an unhealthy path trying to achieve a weight that may not even be possible for myself. The question is how much weight can I lose without running into issues/hurting my performance? Or, am I fine at 132 lbs? I would love honest advice. Also, for some context, I am trying to run D3 (not sure if I will be able to), but on my own, I love trying to beat my own times. 

Thank you so much for advice!",1619564250

AdvancedRunning,brownus,Advice for a heavier runner,"So like a lot of people i started taking running seriously in May time last year, since then I’ve managed to do a  39:05 10k in December, and wanted to start training for a sub 1:30 half and eventually a sub 3 hour marathon. 

In December I injured my foot, an overtraining injury which came up after an easy 20 mile run. Since then I took 5/6 weeks off and was just working back up to my mileage (about 50-55k a week, nothing crazy) until about a month ago I started getting runners knee and haven’t been able to run properly since. 

For reference I’m 6”4, 95kg (209lbs) 24 year old M, with a background in rugby and football. 

I’m just wondering if any heavier runners out there experience continuous injuries. Or if people think that I could benefit by losing some weight considering my goals.

AdvancedRunning,Comfortable-Plan2658,Training Monotony and Training Strain - Input from Data Nerds,"Hi All - I've been nerding out HARD on the stats from Runalyze over the past few weeks, based on the recommendations from this sub, and wanted to share some thoughts on the data and mathematics but really get some perspectives on the reality. 

 I'm seeing that my Training Monotony is getting ""high"" per their calculations.  Right now I'm at 2.12 which is bright red per their stats (should be less than 1.5 per guidance).  My Training Stress is ""green"" (not sure the absolute value means much to you, but in case it does, it is 985).   Based on all that, I would say my Training Monotony is not an indication of overtraining but just right or trending ""inadequate"".  

In doing some more reading about this on Fellrnr, I understand how I would improve my Monotony - primarily by improving the variability of my runs.  This mathematically aligns with the idea of 80/20 training - making the hard runs harder and / or the easy runs easier.  

But now in practice - I would love to hear if anyone finds real impact of these statistics in their training?  Should I change something?  

My body feels great - I just moved up from \~25mpw to \~30mpw by adding 1 day (going from 5 to 6 days per week) and just started the third week of that adaptation.  Not sure that would make a difference, but offer it in case it's helpful.

AdvancedRunning,SufficientPayment629,Critique my Summer Training Plan,"Hi AR,

This summer I'm going to be trying to boost my mileage to about 55-60 MPW in order to get a great fall season in. I'm a 16 year old male cross country and track athlete, and currently during track I've been running in the low 40's for mileage, with easy runs at about 7:10 pace and recovery runs at 7:30+ pace. I've hit 55 miles in a week last summer, and in between seasons, but my average pace per mile went down significantly (to slower than 8:00 per mile) and I barely did any workouts, just easy running with probably 2-3 miles at CV pace per week. My PR's are 9:38 for the 2 mile and a tiny bit under 17:00 for the 5k, from a solo time trial. I'm hoping to break 16 next year in the 5k.

I was thinking, at least for the first half, doing 55-60 mpw with a 45-50 mpw down week every 3 or 4 weeks. I was planning on running something like this:

M: 7 easy, strides

Tu: 2 mile warmup, 4+ mile tempo, 3 mile cooldown

W: 3 mile shakeout, 6 mile easy

Th: 8 easy, strides

F: 7 easy

Sa: 12+ mile long run, planning on doing moderate (6:30 pace), a very hilly loop (3 main hills, 1000 feet gained over 13 miles), and a normal, at easy pace run.

Su: 6 easy

AdvancedRunning,joet10,[Race Report] Solo marathon TT was about as fun as it sounds,"Hi folks, I've mostly been lurking around here/ARTC for the last few years. My last [marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/artc/comments/7ehyhz/race_report_2017_philadelphia_marathon_or_how_i/) was in 2017, and pretty soon after that I came down with a persistent case of plantar fasciitis that took about a year to get under control, which involved almost no running. Since then I've been slowly building up mileage and getting back fitness (learned my lesson about doing too much too fast), and trying to avoid reading/thinking/talking too much about running and just focusing on solid training. I'm mostly writing this as a way to organize my thoughts about the last couple years of training and to serve as a reference for myself going forward, and to hopefully get some useful feedback from the community. I know this is seriously, stupidly long, and I'm explicitly writing in for my own benefit. If anyone actually finds this interesting or gets something useful from it that would be a pleasant surprise.

### Goals
&lt; 2:57

### Training
Like I said in my intro, the main reason I wanted to write this report was as a way to get my thoughts about the last _two years_ of running organized and down on paper, so the reader should consider themselves warned that they are not actually the target audience -- feel free to skip to the actual race.

After finally getting my plantar fasciitis under control in early 2019 (thanks to a new doctor and a night splint), I started the process of piecing some fitness back together. This was my first time coming back to running after a long time off; it was a predictably humbling experience. It helped that I spent 6 weeks in New Zealand for work starting at the end of February 2019, so it was really easy to just enjoy running as a way to explore and not worry about how slow I was. 

By mid-late summer I had gotten up to a few 40 mile weeks. I wasn't following any exact plans, just slowly building mileage with some light workouts. In August I ran the [Harlem 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/2646878171/overview) in 19:11. I ran the same race two years earlier in 18:58, but since then the course had been modified with some more elevation change (141st up to Convent, IYKYK) so I figured those times were roughly equivalent -- definitely an encouraging sign. At some point in the fall I had a bit of an injury scare that I can see in my mileage, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was. Guess it wasn't too serious but I've generally been a lot more aggressive about taking time off when something doesn't feel quite right. At the end of 2019 I raced a [15K](https://www.strava.com/activities/2917266529) in 61 minutes which again was roughly equivalent to my time in the Bronx 10 mile in 2017 (66.5 minutes). I ended 2019 with about 1300 miles for the year, and was just happy to have some decent, sustainable running fitness again.

Going into 2020, my plan was to race a half in the spring and a full in the fall, and I'd tentatively picked out the races (narrator: ""lol""). I did a bit of 5k-specific training at the start of the year, hitting a few 50 mile weeks before running the [Washington Heights 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/3145180925) at the beginning of March. My goal for this race was to run faster than 18:33 for a PR; I ran 18:56. Biggest issue was that both my shoes came untied during the race because I'm a moron and didn't double-knot them (to be fair to me I've run a bunch of races in those shoes without double-knotting them, but had never worn them in below-freezing weather which I'd guess was the issue). I had really wanted that PR and this was the most frustrated I'd been with a race (narrator: ""so far""), but between the shoe fiasco and the course being much hillier than where I set my PR, once I got over myself and looked at the big picture it was another promising sign for my fitness.

Okay, so now we're going into mid-March 2020 -- does that ring a bell for anyone? My mileage took a bit of a hit in the spring, it was just such a crazy time in NYC and there was so much uncertainty about what was/wasn't ok, especially here where all the normal running routes are crowded almost all the time. I eventually settled into a routine of waking up super early (for me, someone whose workday starts around noon) so I could get my run in on the empty streets and more or less completely avoid people, and then getting a nap in before work. I found some pretty decent routes with minimal traffic, the highlight of which was my Sunday long runs from the bottom of Broadway up to Central Park and then meandering my way back down. I really can't overstate how bizarre it was to run through a completely deserted Times Square. My mileage was back up to the 40-50mpw range before too long. I kept this routine up for a few months before going back to my regular routes/times when it was pretty clear outdoor transmission wasn't a big risk. Only thing of note here running-wise was about a week off with some pain -- not exactly sure what it's called, but whatever the soft tissue is between the inside of the ankle and the achilles.

Not too much to say about the summer, just kept running and slowly building. At some point I decided I'd do a 5k TT to take another shot at that PR. I used a modified Pfitz 5k plan, and by September I hit my first 60 week since 2017, and at the beginning of October I ran an [18:28 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/4145271735) for a 5 second PR. This was my first time running an all-out time trial and I did not have an awesome time, splitting 5:52, 5:54, 6:00 + 0:40. I've never really thought that I cared that much about the race ""environment"", but running this alone on a track with nothing but lane-1 walkers to keep me company gave me a new appreciation for crowd support and people to run with. I came away from this thrilled to be back in probably the best shape of my life, and with a healthier respect for running solo TTs. 

With one shiny new PR for the year, I figured I might as well try to knock out a HM PR as well (&lt; 1:29 high). In the run-up to the 5k I had done a decent number of 13-15 mile long runs, so figured I would give myself 2 months to get some HM-specific work in before giving it ago. I ended up taking about a week off at the end of October for another flare-up of the ankle-ish thing from March. I wanted to keep the intensity/mileage in check but still got in some quality work, including a 15 mile progression LR with the last mile around 6:30 and some LT workouts (18 + 14 minutes with 4 min jog, 4 x mile with 1 min jog) around 6:25-6:30. 

I ended up running the half TT at the beginning of December in [1:26:58](https://www.strava.com/activities/4458490659) for a 3 minute PR. After struggling through the 5k I was worried about how I'd do running a longer distance TT. I figured I'd keep the pacing conservative, shooting to run &lt; 1:28 pace for the first half, and then let myself push by feel for the second half. This strategy worked out well for me -- the main thing I wanted to avoid was hurting pretty bad at the halfway point and having to push through that solo. The interesting thing for me was that my legs seemed like the distinctly limiting factor for the first time, and my quads in particular were _really_ beaten up in the couple days after. I've been kind of lazy with strides, and the vast majority of my runs are on a pancake-flat path, so I made a mental note to be better about doing regular strides, and to get more creative with my routes so I could get a bit of elevation in. I took the rest of December pretty easy, just building back up to 60mpw without a real goal mind. 

In the absence of a normal pre-Covid life, I began to feel listless pretty soon after the Half. I'd had the idea of running a solo marathon in the back of my head for a while, but especially after doing that solo 5k in the fall, 26.2 miles at max effort by myself didn't sound all that appealing to me. As the boredom set in towards the end of the year I figured I didn't have anything better to do so I might as well go for it and drew up an outline of planned loosely based on Pfitz's 12/70 for an April marathon, aiming for &lt; 3:00 (ran 3:06 in 2017). 

Training went well, I peaked at 70mpw with a handful of weeks in the 65-70 range. To make sure I was getting at least a little bit of elevation in, I did probably half my long runs either to/from Central Park, or to/from Brooklyn (for the bridges). I followed Pfitz's general weekly structure with a workout on Tuesday or Friday (when you don't have a MP long run) and a medium-long run Wednesday, generally in the 12-14 mile range. I think I padded the plan with an extra easy week or two to make the schedule line up with the date I picked, and also took an unplanned easy week due to weather. Note that here I'm just describing what I did; I'll talk more about what I thought worked/didn't work later on. Here are most of the workouts worth mentioning to give an idea of what the training looked like:

* 16 w/ 8 MP: Averaged 6:41 for the MP, had been thinking 6:45-6:50 but this felt reasonable. (Jan. 24)

* 2 x 2 miles LT w/ 2 mins jogging: All between 6:20-6:25 (Jan. 29)

* 17 w/ 10 MP: Averaged 6:42 for the MP, with the first 8 around 6:45 and the last 2 closer to 6:30 for ""fun"". Legs felt really beat up after this (Feb. 14)

* First 18 miler: 7:30 average felt pretty easy (Feb. 21)

* 3 + 2 miles LT w/ 3 mins jogging: Averaged 6:24 for the 3, 6:21 for the 2. (Feb. 24)

* 18 w/ 12 MP: Averaged 6:41 MP. Felt quite a bit harder than the previous MP workouts (Feb. 28)

* 6 x 800m VO2 max: 2:55, 2:53, 2:53, 2:53, 2:53, 2:52 (March 9)

* 5 miles LT: Ran on the track, 6:23, 6:22, 6;20, 6:16, 6:16 (+ 10 seconds for last 45m). Pleasantly surprised at how easy this was, definitely could have started out quicker. (March 16)

* 20 miles with second half progression: Average pace was 7:13, first half around 7:45 then cut down second half finishing with the last few miles around 6:30. (March 21)

* 5 x 1 1k VO2 max w/ 400m jogging: 3:32, 3:31, 3:32, 3:30, 3:30. Really happy with this, effort was very much in control and didn't feel hard until the last rep. (March 30)

* 5K tuneup TT: 17:54, 34 second PR from the fall. Ran this with a heavy negative split, 1600s were 5:52, 5:44, 5:37. After struggling through doing the 5k solo last fall I didn't want to be in a similar position where I was starting to hurt pretty bad 1-1.5 miles in (which I think is pretty normal for an all-out 5k effort) and struggling to motivate myself to push through. Definitely an encouraging sign for my fitness. (April 9)

* 2 x (2MP + 1 LT): Little sharpening tempo 10 days out. Average paces were 6:43, 6:17, 6:32, 6:16. As you can see I had some trouble locking in the MP for the second half, which is perhaps some foreshadowing (April 13)

I did something like a 2.5 week taper, with the 5k TT two weeks before the marathon and a couple easy days before the 5k. The taper was horrible, way worse than I remember from previous races. I had a few different areas flareup, the most troubling of which was my right achilles which is an area I'd had issues with before but not really during this training cycle. It really just felt like once I started cutting mileage down everything tightened up. I took a couple unplanned days off during the taper as a reuslt of this, which might have been a self-reinforcing cycle -- I felt crappy from cutting mileage so I cut mileage more and felt crappier. Achilles got better during the week before the race but was still tight in the morning and for the first few miles of my runs. I also felt the same way during my recovery weeks, just a lot tighter than normal and generally flat.

### Pre-race
I planned out the route to be two out-and-backs on the Hudson greenway, so my wife could meet me at the halfway point (which was also the start/finish) to swap out bottles. I used two 18oz handhelds with diluted gatorade mix, probably around 80-100 calories each. I also planned to take 3 gels during the race, which is what I did during Philly. I had pre-ordered a pair of Atreyu Artists that got delivered a few weeks ago (wore them for a tempo and a long run) so I wore those for the race.

The weather was looking pretty good but on the warm side for what I was used to so I figured I'd get an early start at 7am -- it was about 50 at 7am, up to 60 by 10am. Forecast for wind was pretty minimal, although from experience I've learned there's always more wind on the river.

I copied my morning routine exactly from my last marathon. Woke up at 4 (3 hours pre-race), and had coffee, 1.5 cups of white rice, and half a liter of water by 4:30 then just hung out and let my body work through that. The ""start line"" was about a mile away, so I left around 6:30 and walked/jogged my way over as a warmup. Started exactly at 7.

My goal was to run 6:45s and get in under 2:57. Although I'd set out training with just sub-3 in mind, after running all my MP long runs comfortably faster than that it felt like it would be sandbagging a bit to shoot for 2:59. I figured since there wasn't actually anything riding on like (e.g. a BQ) I might as well leave it all out there.

### Race
(Splits from my watch auto-lapping miles)
## Miles 1-10 (6:41, 6:51, 6:31, 6:42, 6:47, 6:40, 6:42, 6:45, 6:46, 6:42): 
This was all pretty uneventful. On average I was a few seconds faster than what I wanted, but given my MP runs had been closer to 6:40 I was okay being a few seconds fast as long as it felt fine. I think the second/third mile splits are mostly GPS having an issue at the end of the second mile and catching up during the third mile, pretty sure I was closer to 6:40 for both of those miles. When I turned around at 6.5ish miles I was a little alarmed to find that I had apparently had a bit of a tailwind without realizing it, but was able to keep plugging away. Overall I felt pretty good during this whole stretch, knew I was a little fast but wasn't overly concerned. Took a gel around mile 5. 

## Miles 11-13 (6:51, 6:36, 6:33): 
Well hmm, those splits look a little different. I think the mile 11 split was the same GPS issue as during mile 2. The problem here was that I got fixated on my watch, and during miles 12 and 13 it was consistently showing my pace in the 7:00-7:30 range. I knew I couldn't have slowed down that much because I felt like my effort was the same, but I was an idiot and kept staring at my watch instead of just ignoring it and trusting my legs (needed Obi-Wan's ghost in my ear telling me to turn off my targeting computer). As a result, I kept pushing harder to try to get ""on pace"". Obviously as we can see here, I hadn't actually slowed down and probably would have been right on pace if I had trusted my legs. Instead I sped up and dug myself a bit of a hole. Took a gel around mile 12, and swapped bottles at the halfway point without any issues.

## Miles 14-19 (6:42, 6:44, 6:46, 6:50, 6:48, 6:45):
Since I had autosplits on I knew I had run the previous couple of miles too fast. I made a half-hearted effort to slow down a bit more and give my body some time to catch up, but didn't have much success with that. I was still feeling okay for the first few miles here, although perceived effort was going up. By mile 16 or 17 I was getting the first inkling that I might be in trouble -- there wasn't any one thing I can point to but I was feeling generally worse and could feel the fatigue creeping into my legs. 

I think this was also a psychological barrier since my longest MP interval had been 12 miles, so in a sense I was in uncharted territory here. Took my final gel around mile 18. My turnaround point was just short of mile 20, and for the few miles before that I was just telling myself I had to hold on until the turnaround and then I could grit out the last quarter of the race. 

## Miles 20-26.2 (6:53, 6:57, 7:10, 7:15, 7:34, 8:02, 8:14, 7:26 pace for the last fraction):
He did not grit out last quarter of the race. I probably don't have to say too much here, the splits paint a much more vivid picture than I could with words. I had personally never bonked before so this was a real interesting experience for me. When I turned around just before mile 20, I could tell things were going to be bad and I almost certainly wouldn't hit &lt; 2:57, but I didn't fully grasp how bad things were going to get until a few miles later. At mile 23.2 I was at exactly 2:38, i.e. if I could just run 7:20s for three more miles I could get in under 3 hours. It became clear very quickly that that wasn't going to happen, and I was just focused on getting to the finish. 

I'm not going to bother trying to really describe how I felt since I've read other people's descriptions of going through the same thing but I think it's the type of thing where you've either been through it and you get it, or you haven't and you don't (saying that as someone in the latter group until now). Suffice to say it felt really bad, it wasn't like the end of a 5k or something where you're trying to force yourself to suffer a little bit more to run a little bit faster, it was like I was just physically incapable of moving my legs any faster. I was also noticing the increasing the temperature and starting to drink more until I realized I was going to finish my bottle with a few miles to go. I think I screwed up the turnaround a bit, I hit 26.22 miles before the start/finish and obviously wasn't particularly concerned with my time at that point so I just slogged along until the ""finish line"" where my wife was waiting. Total time was 3:02:54, Strava says the marathon was 3:01:43 which would be a 5 minute PR.

### Post-race
Was, um, not the cheeriest person in the world. Sat and sipped on water and ginger ale for 15 minutes or so while venting to my wife. Started the mile walk home for about 5 minutes before just giving up and taking a cab. I was pretty out of it the rest of the day unsurprisingly. I think I drank about 4 liters of water before I finally had to pee. Small blessing was that my stomach was mostly okay, which has frequently not been the case for me after hard efforts. I wasn't hungry but didn't have any trouble getting myself to eat. This is by far the most sore I've been in my life. Everything from hips/groin down to my feet was just absolutely brutal. I'm writing this two days after the race and I'm still really sore, but am at least not limping now. 

### Reflections - Race
Where to start... I guess the most obvious thing is that I just went out a little too fast. I don't think this was disastrous; eyeballing the splits I was maybe a bit less than a minute fast after 10 miles. Obviously not ideal as I probably dug a bit of a hole here, but not the end of the world. 

Next up, not trusting my body and panick-running 6:36 and 6:33 for miles 12 and 13. Again on its own I don't think this doomed me to blow up, but two miles at 10 seconds faster than MP right in the middle of marathon isn't nothing. This was just a phenomenally stupid unforced error and probably the aspect of the race I'm most frustrated with since it's was so easily preventable by just listening to my legs. Dumb. Combined with the slightly fast first 10 miles, I think we're starting to see the writing on the wall.

Last issue was hydration. This was the warmest weather I did a relatively long, hard effort in this training cycle and I felt it. Obviously 50-60 degrees isn't hot, but I'm sensitive to warm weather, my ideal racing weather is probably in the low 40s to start. For all my long runs I used a single handheld bottle of gatorade (18oz), so I thought that two for the full marathon would be okay and didn't think too much of it. In retrospect this probably wasn't sufficient for me with this weather, given that I finished both bottles. 

I'm leaning toward these three things being my main issues, in addition to maybe overestimating my fitness slightly. I don't think nutrition was the main cause of the bonk as I consumed at least as many calories as I did during my last marathon, although this was a harder relative effort me.

My gut feeling is that if I had paced myself perfectly running 6:45s (or better yet, had a group to run with) I probably could have at least gotten close to 2:57, and at the very least could have run 2:59 somewhat comfortably.

Sub 2:57 was absolutely ambitious but I don't think it was crazy given my training, in particular some of those MP long runs and the 5k tuneup. While it would've been nice to at least scrape by with a sub-3 time, I'm proud of myself for setting an aggressive goal and going for it. In the past I've set pretty conservative goals which, I don't know, isn't such a bad thing -- it does feel good to smash a goal. But eventually that was going to hold me back, and this was a good opportunity to really push myself where the stakes were low. Screwing up a marathon is always frustrating since you can only run them all-out so often, but it's not the end of the world. The upside of being a hobbyjogger is that we have the luxury of appreciating the journey over the destination; obviously I want to race well but I don't have a team depending on me or sponsorships on the line or whatever, and if I'm happy with myself for putting in a lot of good work training, a shitty result doesn't have to tarnish that.

It would've been nice to have a shiny PR starting with ""2"", but in the grand scheme of things I'm happy with myself for giving it a good send, and I think I'm more satisfied than I would have been had I run a 2:59:59 with dead even splits feeling like I had something left in the tank.

### Reflections - Training
At a high level I'm happy with how training went. I saw definite gains in fitness, with a lot of solid workouts and especially a great 5k PR. Of course a decent chunk of that improvement is probably from just running sustained solid mileage, and there are some aspects of my training I want to rethink.

First, I was really frustrated throughout this training block with my recovery weeks. I almost always felt worse during them than I did during my regular weeks, and don't think I ever felt fresh at the end of them. The recovery weeks themselves were pretty vanilla, I cut mileage by about 20% and replaced workouts with strides. I don't think this is wrong? This same issue carried over into my taper -- I never really felt good in the couple weeks before the race. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. Maybe it's overtraining? The odd thing is that I felt pretty good outside of the recovery weeks. I mean I was obviously tired like I'd expect while in a marathon buildup, but I never really felt like I was overdoing it except when I was feeling like crap during recovery weeks. There weren't any obvious overtraining red flags; my sleep was fine, appetite was good, resting heart rate didn't go crazy, etc. This is an area I'd love to have some feedback on if anyone's dealt with something similar. I guess forward I'll try experimenting with how I structure recovery weeks, maybe keeping a light workout in or something to see if that keeps me feeling a little more sharp.

There was one stretch where I may have pushed things a little bit. Feb. 14 I did 17 w/ 10 MP, Feb. 21 I did 18 miles at a decent pace, Feb. 24 I did a 3 + 2 miles LT workout, and Feb. 28 I did 18 w/ 12 MP. Mileages for those weeks were 62, 66, 67. My recollection from Pfitz's original plan is that you generally have an easier week in between any MP long runs, but I had shuffled weeks around as a result of inclement weather. If I did end up in recovery debt, I think this is where it happened.

I also regret not doing any MP long runs closer to the actual race. The Pfitz 12/70 plan I used as a starting point had the last one 6 weeks before the race, and with my shuffling/padding weeks it ended up being 8 weeks for me. I know Pfitz in general tends to emphasize faster, VO2 max-type workouts as ""sharpening"" as you get closer to the race, which I'm sure is fine and he obviously knows more about this than I do, but with the additional two weeks I added in I really did not feel marathon-sharp going into the race. I recently read Brad Hudson's book, and I thought his philosophy was an interesting contrast, with much more of a focus on MP sharpening as you get closer to the race. I think I'd like to try this approach next time.

Similar to the HM in the fall, my legs felt so beat up after this race. I told myself I would put more of an emphasis on frequent strides and hill work and I did to a degree, but I think that wasn't sufficient. I felt pretty strong aerobically throughout the training cycle, but legs were consistently feeling beat up, in particular the lower-leg, soleus-achilles area. Again after reading Hudson's book, I want to start incorporating hill springs into my training, as well as doing some dedicated hill workouts. I've been kind of lazy and avoided them since the only feasible hills for me are the bridges which can be crowded and engulfed in car exhaust, but I probably just need to get over myself and spend more time on them. In the same vein, I've been reading through Running Rewired and have identified a few weak areas that I want to work on.

### What's next
Taking a couple weeks with minimal running. I've got my second Pfizer shot at the beginning of next week, so the timing works out well for me to just not think about running for a bit. My legs are still extremely sore, so I want to give myself plenty of time to heal up. There are some actual normal races happening in NY now (relatively normal at least, still staggered starts but no masks required while racing), so I'll probably pick out a 5k or 10k over the summer to give myself something to work towards. At the moment I'm thinking I'll want to run a real marathon in the fall, but not obviously have plenty of time to make up my mind about that.",1619474428

\### Training

I did the Pfitz 18/70.  It felt like a good program, and I'd done two cycles of half-marathon using Pfitz..  Mid-week runs at 13, 14, 15 miles were tough at first....more mentally than physically....but eventually got used to them.

Early- to mid-part of the program felt heavy on the fatigue-meter.  Towards the end, 68 to 70 miles started to feel ok....even normal.  By the end of the program, I felt better trained than I had in any past training block.  My last couple of 20 mile long runs at easy to steady pace felt easy and comfortable.

My biggest concern (as always) is shooting for the right pacing.  I may be a little gun shy from a marathon three years ago where I went out too fast, ignored the 85F weather, and DNF'd at mile 24.

Tune up races said I should be capable of 2:51 to 2:52.  My VO2 progress spreadsheet / graph and personal history suggested about 2:54.  I typically underperform at marathon by about 1.5 VO2 (compared to 10k or HM).  I felt pretty good shooting for 2:54 or 6:40 / mile.

\### Race

Weather was very promising.  Forecast a week out was for rain Saturday and then mid-40's on race day.  I was worried this rain might creep into Sunday morning, but the forecast held.  We had about 48F and a light breeze at gun time.

I went back and forth on wardrobe choice....probably (definitely) obsessed too much over it.  I ended up wearing a warmish, tight-fitting base layer over my tank.  I also normally pin my bib to my shorts to allow easy removal of layers, but for some reason I pinned my bib to my top layer....thinking 45 with 10mph wind would be cold enough to definitely need the extra layer.

When I got to the starting corral, I think I was the only one wearing anything more than a t-shirt or tank.  Due to some wayfinding problems (I ended up going to the half marathon corrals and having to jog to the marathon starting corral), I was a little frazzled and didn't feel like messing with the bib and safety pins (with cold fingers) before the start.

The course was pretty good.  It had some nice long straight stretches, with portions on a nice bike path and cuts through a nature preserve.  There were some really winding stretches (miles 7-10, and 15-17) with lots of turns through residential neighborhoods that seemed like they were just there to add mileage and show off the fancy houses.

Through miles 3,4,5 I was feeling hot and sweaty and my heart rate was higher than expected....especially for so early in the race.  I made the decision to sacrifice a little time, and get rid of my top layer.  I pulled over by the drink table at mile 7, took off my hat / headphones, took off my outer layer, undid the safety pins, took off my tank, threw it down on the ground, pinned the bib on that, threw that on, put my hat and headphones on and took off.  Total cost = 60 seconds....but worth it in the end.  My heart rate came back down, and I wasn't sweating as much. 

This was my first marathon where I was running faster than any pace group, so that was interesting.  There was a fair amount of discussion out on the road with the people around me....what pace are you keeping, what finish time are you shooting for, etc...For the most part I was generally running alone or with one or two other people for short stretches.

Other than the wardrobe malfunction, the race felt good.  I felt pretty strong throughout, and never felt labored or struggled to maintain pace.  I felt some building muscle fatigue in my right glute, but it never got worse than normal fatigue....and no cramping. 

I was able to slowly pick off people that passed me during mile 7.  I finished strong and managed a little bit of a kick for the last 1.2, passing several youngsters.

\### Lessons Learned

1. Don't plan a wardrobe that might require you to mess with your bib during a race.  Wear the bib on your shorts or even on your flip belt.  Seems obvious, but.....
2. It's probably better to be a little too cold during the race than too warm.
3. I think I might have been a little conservative in my pacing.  I ended up negative splitting....even if I take out the 60 seconds lost on mile 7, I still ran the back half 2-3 seconds/mile faster.  
4. I was tired by the end, but not wiped out.  I could have started my kick maybe 2-3 miles out...or better yet gone for closer to 6:35 / mile.  I think I can be a  little more aggressive in my pacing strategy.

All in all, it was fantastic to be at a real, live race.  And I'm super-pleased with the training and result.

AdvancedRunning,LivingZesty,Maintaining fitness/sanity with pelvic fracture,"Howdy y'all. Some of you may remember a post of mine regarding overtraining and burnout around 8 months ago. Thankfully I found a better place mentally with sport and training and whatnot. But due to combination of poor nutrition and overtraining I've managed to injure myself pretty seriously. 

Felt what I can only describe as a groin cramp while doing a track workout which got progressively worse until I realized I couldn't actually physically hit the speed I wanted to hit. Jogged home with some discomfort, but didn't really think too much of it. Range of motion was pretty bad, and the next day there was no way I could run on it. I'm mainly a triathlete so I've been biking on a trainer since then to minimize any possible impact. 

Turns out I have two fractures on my right ischium, and one on my left; I feel no pain and can walk/stand comfortably. Just today I saw an orthopedic surgeon who told me to expect about 6-8 more weeks of no running due to my poor nutritional status. I'm allowed to walk, though he says biking is probably not a good idea, and swimming should be just pulling. I've been told that exercise really should be minimal for the time being to help me heal and recover physiologically, but it's a bitter pill to swallow when I'm used to training anywhere from 15-20 hours a week in season and was excited to be getting back into serious tri stuff over the summer. For reference he says ideally maybe swimming 3 times a week for 45 mins at most. Sigh...

Anyways, I guess this is a wakeup call to get my shit together, rest up, and put on some weight. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experience and recommendations for how to approach this mentally and/or physically. He also says that some upper-body strength training should be fine, just nothing like squatting or deadlifts, etc. so I might stick to walking and some strength to bulk up a bit. 21M btw, and 5'7 and between 105-110 lbs I think.",1619465552

AdvancedRunning,liamdarbo,Marathon final stretch advice,"Hey everyone, 

For context to the post, I’m training for the Manchester marathon in October. I’m a 25 year old male, approx 200lbs and I’ve been training since January. 

Yesterday myself and a couple of friends ran 25km (15.5 miles). This is my joint longest run to date. This time I completed it in 2hrs 31mins and last Summer it took me 3hrs 5mins solo.

Towards the 23rd/24th kilometre I felt completely drained, empty and depleted. The sun also made me terribly dehydrated and at one point I felt like I was hallucinating. 

When we eventually finished, I felt a great sense of accomplishment (as well as feeling a good few blisters in the making) but I seriously questioned how I would find the ability to pull another 17km/11miles out of the bag, from this point.

So my question is: What advice can you give based on your experiences, in regards to mentally and physically completing the second half of a marathon?

I would appreciate any advice you could offer.

Thankyou :)",1619461908

AdvancedRunning,heartconfetti,Boston Marathon Training,"Hello, runners!

I got a charity bib to run The Boston Marathon this year. I’m running it for Back on My Feet, a non-profit that combats homelessness through running.

I have a few questions for you.

My last marathon was in 2013, with a PR of 3:40.

I got injured (3 herniated discs in my lower back) and then got pregnant and have had two children since.

I still run around 15 miles a week, but I primarily lift heavy and do CrossFit since it has made my back so much stronger.

I need a 24 week marathon plan. I’ve looked at Hanson’s and I like it, but I don’t know if my back can handle six days of running. I would LOVE to PR so I’d like to work toward that. I’ve done 4 marathons in total, but again, I haven’t run one in years. I need a plan that I can still lift on.

I also have a question for anyone that has fundraised - how did you do it? I’ve been getting rejection emails and getting turned down in person by almost every company I ask. I’ve offered ad space on my running singlet and all of my social media.

I’ve asked friends and family.

I’m going to do a 50/50 raffle and find restaurants to fundraise at.

I’m not a week in and I’ve raised $1,365!

I need to raise $10,000.

I’m running in memory of my little sister, who was chronically homeless under the influence of heroin and after being sober for 21 months, relapsed and passed away.

Training

 24M. I hadn’t been running much in winter mostly because I’d rather Xc ski than run on snow and ice but I stayed in decent shape usually about 3 workouts a week. I ended up buying a treadmill in January and started running again at that point. I used Hal Higdons HM intermediate 2 12 week plan modified to start at 20 MPW and work up to 40 MPW. I was using this as a base building plan to build mileage for Hanson’s beginner marathon plan. It was nice to still have some workouts but none that were super challenging. I ran a 5k time trial in 19:47 on the treadmill and a 10k time trial in 44:17 in my build up which were both PRs so I was feeling pretty confident that I could run 1:45 even though the course I chose was quite hilly and there was a decent wind today. 

Pre-race

I was working night shifts. Yesterday was the last night in my set so I got home around 8 and ate some oatmeal with apples and went to sleep. I woke up at 2 and drank some water and lazed around until 3 then did lunge matrix and leg swings, 1 mile warmup with 2 strides

Race

Mile 1-3
Focused on keeping it easy. Legs felt amazing. Mile 3 is a huge downhill so I felt that my pacing was pretty consistent effort wise
Mile 4-8
Tried to keep it nice and relaxed. Pacing still felt good. My legs were starting to feel slightly fatigued at the end of mile 6 after a nice uphill that I tried to convince myself wasn’t as bad as I rememberedMile 8 is another nice downhill so I tried to take advantage and stay light and try to bank a little time. 
Mile 9
I was dreading this hill for pretty much the whole run. I tried to run pretty hard up the hill. Figured it was close enough to the end that I could start hurting a bit. I lost less time than I thought I was going to up it but was feeling pretty tired. I was greeted at the top with a nice headwind. Overall a tough mile
Mile10-12
I felt like I had more left in the tank at this point than I thought I would. So started pushing pretty hard
Mile 13
First half of this mile was awful. I had a killer headwind and very slight uphill. I felt like I was running 7:30 min/m looked down at my watch and it said I had averaged 8:11 since the start of the mile. So I double downed on the effort got to my turnaround and gave it my all. Tailwind and slight downhill made it pretty fast. 


Post-race

Very happy with the result. I walked for a bit and ran half a mile. Felt a bit like puking. Thankfully I didn’t. Drank a bunch of Gatorade and a boost smoothie and then went to my in-laws for supper. I’m taking a week of low mileage probably 15-20 then starting Hanson’s beginner marathon plan with a goal of 3:35 for the marathon at the end of august.

AdvancedRunning,ester028,Slow Normal Running Pace?,"I was wondering if any people here have really slow running paces when compared to their pr’s. I’ve always been very slow when it comes to normal runs when compared to my pr’s. For context, I run a 4:37 mile and a 17:09 5k (5:31? Pace). Based on workouts I’ve done I’m pretty sure I could hold 5:55-6:00 pace for an hour if I go all out. The problem is, most of my normal runs are around 7:30 pace. On top of that, I usually do 8:00-8:40 pace on recovery days. 

To the point; I’m on a high school team, and my coach has a spreadsheet of paces that he suggests we do. My “normal running pace” is 6:55 and that’s based off of my 5k time which is proportionately worse than my 2 mile and mile times. I’ve just never really been able to run close to that pace consistently. I may run this fast once a month, and it will feel pretty normal, but if I tried to do that everyday I’m sure I’d burn out. All of my teammates are often able to hit there’s (and most of the time they go much faster) pretty easily and consistently. I know that everyone’s body is different, but I can’t help but wonder why my body can only handle much slower paces than everyone else. Is there anyone else on this sub who has this problem? Are there any ways I can improve my normal run pace? Is my general fitness being lowered because of this?",1619391862
AdvancedRunning,coasttrash404,Anyone here in the Gulf South? Looking for race recs,"Bit of a shot in the dark but I was wondering if anyone lives in the Gulf South (MS, AL, LA, western FL panhandle) and might be willing to share any race recommendations. 

I'm in south Mississippi and there's a running club here that puts on great events but, unsurprisingly, this particular part of the world does not exactly have a flourishing running culture so there are not a whole lot of race options. I was planning on a 5k for 5/22 and training accordingly, but when I went to register I realized I either had the date mixed up or they moved it back a week since I last checked the calendar, so now I'm trying to find a good race for 5/22 or 5/23 somewhere between Mobile and New Orleans.

This made me realize that it might be a good idea to plan my training for the next year around specific races that are known to be especially scenic, well run, fun, good for PRs, etc., especially since I don't have a particular preference as to which distance I focus on next. **So with that background: Are there any 10ks, half marathons and marathons you would especially recommend in this region?**

I ran the Mississippi Gulf Coast Marathon in December and thought it was pretty good except for the last 1.5 miles or so when you run up an interstate ramp that is so dramatically slanted that it really hurt my knees. And also there are slight gaps between the sections of the interstate bridge, connected by scary looking metal teeth so not like you will fall to your death but definitely like a violent tripping incident is possible. So also if there are regional races you would avoid / want to complain about on this post, I'd love to hear that too!",1619384829
AdvancedRunning,SparkyDogPants,Any asthmatics here? New to asthma and struggling to get back to my routine.,"Got asthma from pneumonia/covid last April. My doctor has tried to help me kick it, but it looks like it’s here to stay. 

I used to run 50-70 MPW, but now it seems like I’m lucky to put 7 in before I have constant wheezing. 

I finally saw a specialist who told me to pre-treat four puffs of albuterol before running, and that seemed to help quite a bit today when I did two very slow miles. I also didn’t realize that I’ll probably never need to take pre workout again if albuterol gets you that pumped up. 

Is there anything else I can do? My insurance will pay for pretty much anything as long as I can get a dr to sign off on it. I’m doing two Flovent puffs in the morning/night. Albuterol as needed.   Prednisone taper. And another inhaler that I get Monday, idr what it is.",1619377861
AdvancedRunning,TruuTree,Podcast recommendations?,"Hey yall,

I've never really been a music or podcast while running listener but lately I've been thinking of downloading some podcasts to accompany me on some of my long trail runs. I was hoping for some of your guys' favorite podcasts to listen to while running.

AdvancedRunning,BTesla92,Start running long distance,"So guys, I have been a sprinter all my life, and play a bit of football/soccer. But my endurance when it comes to running anywhere beyond 800m is so trash. I last ran 1 mile before the pandemic and when I did that, I couldn’t even run the full mile without stopping on 3 occasions. So I just want to know how to properly get started with running long distance. I’m not sure if anyone has heard of the NHS Couch to 5K - where you build yourself, across 12 weeks, to run 5K without stopping. Here is an example of week 1 of the program:

“For your 3 runs in week 1, you will begin with a brisk 5-minute walk. After this, you will alternate 1 minute of running and 1-and-a-half minutes of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.”

You gradually decrease your walk time and increase your run time over the weeks, until you can run 5K without stopping. My minimum aim is to be able to run 10K without stopping and maybe do the London Marathon in 2022. Any tips and a program that will help me get started and reach those goals?",1619365725

I want to find a physio who would help me with my running style. I don't need someone to tell me how to train - I'm happy with that. Rather I want someone who can watch me run and look at my muscles to help me improve my running efficiency.

AdvancedRunning,abcdef__a,Running 5 vs 6 days a week in season,"High school sophomore guy here. Primarily 1600 guy, but run 32s and 8s as well. 5:10 mile shape rn.

I have a history of injury from ramping up milage too fast (stress fracture, achilles tendonitis). Built up slow this season and the last 2-3 weeks I’ve been sitting at 28-30mpw. 5 days a week of running. 2 hard sessions a week (counting a race as a hard session. Sometimes 2 races a week, sometimes 2 workouts, sometimes a combo you get the deal).

The injuries come on pushing past 35 mpw. That seems to be my limit I’d say. Obviously could build slowly and ease into something high but in season my debate is basically 30mpw on 5 days a week or 35-36 ish on 6 days a week.

Obviously running more miles is better for your aerobic system, but is an extra 5mpw for 4-5 weeks going to make a massive difference? One way to think about it is that 25mpw extra is basically an extra week of training.

My other school of thought is like focus on staying healthy, recovering well, making the most out of my quality sessions, and keep it to 5 days a week this season. I’m more fresh for races only running 5 days a week and my legs just feel better day to day because i get a really complete reset on them over the weekend. 

I’m leaning towards chilling out at 30 this season. I can do 35 safely, but is it worth it? I don’t think it’ll injure me, but risk goes up. Opinions?",1619333318
AdvancedRunning,brucebrownfuturedpoy,5k/800m Goals,"
Okay so I’m writing this after competing at the sectionals meet today and yesterday. At sectionals I unfortunately did not make state. I’m writing this so I can maybe get a prediction of what 5k time I can run this xc season and what 800m time I can run next track season. Right now my goals are sub 18 and sub 2. (May be a little ambitious but idc)

So I started running January 2020. I was a freshman and was having my first track season. I didn’t really care about track at all. I ran a 5:39 1600 and a 59.48 400m in the 2 or 3 meets we had.

May 2020 is where I started running more. I decided to do cross country and probably averaged 20-25 mpw in June on all easy runs. July we started doing workouts. Later in the season, I started getting a little more serious and probably averaged ~30 mpw in October/November. My pr for the season was 19:36 (on milesplit it says 18:46 but we learned that that course was 200m short so I don’t count it). I also ran a half marathon in 1:51 a week after the season ended. It was a trail run and involved running through a lot of water and mud.

Over the winter I just wanted to build up a good mileage base. I peaked at 45 mpw in early January with a long run of 14 miles. My run paces were mostly 8-8:30. I didn’t really do any workouts and no speed, I only really did strides every once in a while.

During track season mileage was pretty low. If I had to guess it was ~20 mpw. I trained with the distance guys which I think might not have been best for me. Also near the end of the season I could not do long runs fast any more. My long run pace was ~9:10 the last few weeks (long runs were no more than 5-6 miles last month of season). My pr for the 800m was 2:10.55 (although I ran a 2:07 relay split). Other prs: 3200: 11:42 (ran once) 1600: 5:15 (ran once).

This summer I want to get to around 50 mpw while also doing speed work and other things to keep me trained for the 800. I’ve researched a lot of 800 training and I think I have a pretty good idea of what to do.

Anyways, are my goals realistic? Sub 18 and sub 2? I just want some feedback. Thank you in advance.",1619319672

AdvancedRunning,atomicsf,Coros Apex vs Garmin 645 vs Polar Vantage V2?,"So I’m finally at a point in my running where I think I need to ditch my Apple Watch 4 and get a “real” watch.

Context: running 50-72 miles a month (not a lot in general but a lot of me although I’m still somewhat slow 9-10 min/mile), 152 lbs, 50s. 

Got into running seriously 1-1/2 years ago and love it. I’m a bit of a data geek (into shoes, form, nutrition, training).

Looking for something that is reliable (recently got the Polar H10 HRM), run mostly by heart rate and sometimes pace. Trying to follow the 80/20 rule for aerobic/anaerobic (not quite MAF). 

I’d like the watch for GPS, heart rate tracking, training, recovery, battery life, and hopefully some running form feedback (l/r, vertical velocity, ground contact time, etc.) so I can improve.

I don’t listen to music or audio and looking primarily for the key features above. I don’t need superfluous bells and whistles.

Would appreciate advice between the models listed above. Or others. And why.

If I should be thinking differently and if I’m not quite there yet for a sports watch, let me know.

Thanks everyone!",1619313520
AdvancedRunning,kedward8,Best watch for intervals?,"I'm looking at what watch I should upgrade to from my garmin forerunner 35.
With the fr35 I can only do basic automated intervals ex. All miles lumped in a warm up and cool down are lumped into a segment, and one interval set between. The interval can be any distance, rest, and reps as long as they are all the same distance and rest.

I run on the road or park paths, never the track. So using the lap button doesn't work for me.

I'm currently running phitz HM 2 program, so I'm already getting into runs that are too complicated for my watch, but its going to get worse as I get into ladder intervals.

I've seen a lot of recommendations for forerunner 235, or Coros Pace/Apex. I'm not familiar with Coros at all. any other recommendations are also appreciated!",1619298300

\### Pre-Training info:

This was the race I was training from Oct. 2019 through June 2020. My training was put on pause after I contracted Covid-19. It destroyed my fitness and ability to train after I was no longer infected. It wasn't until October of 2020 that I was able to run for more than 20 minutes at a time. My family was moving around then so I never got a chance to set a routine for training. It wasn't until January of 2021 that I was able to start figuring out a schedule. I finally got a weekly routine set and started back into a training block about 6 weeks ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Training: 

My training block revolved around avaiable time in my day. It boiled down to about an hour of total time for prep, running, and clean-up. I fit my runs in where I could; before work, to work, at lunch, or after work. I started with running 4 miles each run. I didn't enjoy this though as most of training in life was time based. I switched to running for time instead of distance. It allowed for a more relaxed feel and less stress on easy days. I also participated in a weekly ultimate frisbee league so I counted games as workouts. This meant I has 6 frisbee workouts and only 2 true running workout. The first workout was 10x\~150m hill sprints at the local high school cross. The second was 6x400m with 2 minutes rest also on the hills of the local cross country course. These were 3 weeks and 2 weeks ago, respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race Plan

I wanted to run a negative split race as my long runs from the summer always happened to be that and they felt good. My coach set a plan to follow. Hit splits the first half of the race and run for feel and with your guts in the second half. The first 7 planned splits were 7:36, 7:33, 7:29, 7:25, 7:22, 7:18, 7:15. The rest was just race and run hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-Race

Pre-race started the night before. I had some pot stickers and teriyaki chicken with steamed rice and steamed veggies. I also had 2 beers which made my evening jog feel TERRIBLE. But, I can't resist a few at a D&amp;D session. 

The morning of was chilly and wet. A light rain at 50 degrees makes for a hard time getting out of the car. I did minimal warm-up because I'm a wuss and hoped it wouldn't hurt me later. The starting pace was only a tad faster than my easy easy days during training which made me confident I'd warm up as the race progressed. I got in the middle of the first wave so I would potentially have people to chase. The race director said the starting and commands and we were off. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Miles 1-3: I wanted to really hit my splits so I wouldn't blow up later. I had to talk to myself out loud to really drive home staying calm. I wrote the paces I needed to hit on my arm so I wouldn't be stressed about what I needed to hit. I started a tad fast but felt relaxed so I held pace and nailed the mile 3 time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 4-6: The hills on this section would be light and rolling. I wanted to be slightly aggressive on the up-hills, not putting in extra effort but just enough to stay on pace, and relax on the down-hills. I managed to really cruise through here. I settled into a nice rhythm and kept my spirits up by thanking the aide stations and the race supporters along the way. My times were a little off pace here from the hills but they just about averaged where I needed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 7-9: I have run this part of the course plenty of times because it is right by my old office. Mile 8 had the second longest hill on the course but I knew just how to run from practice. The rest of the 3 miles was basically flat or downhill so a little extra on the hill wouldn't hurt. I hit my mile 7 mark and then stopped paying too much attention to the pace setting on my watch. I only looked down at the mile markers for frame of reference. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 10-13.1: Mile 10 SUCKED. It was almost all up-hill and pretty steep. I think if this mile was a little flatter or had one less hill I could have gone sub 1:35. I did my best to not over work on it and make up some ground on mile 11. I separated from the main group of runners at mile 9 so I didn't have the pack to carry me anymore. There was a lady about 400m ahead that I decided I needed to catch at the end. Miles 11 and 12 clicked by with my stride staying strong. I caught the lady right before mile 13. I finished with a really nice sprint and caught one more guy before the line. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-Race Thoughts

I am so happy with how today went. After having Covid I thought my racing days were over. But with barely any mileage under my belt and a 1:35 Half the future is looking bright. The results and feel of this race was going to decide if its worth continuing to train or if I should hang up the shoes. I am happy to say that I am beyond excited to work up the mileage and get a nice block under my belt before the fall. My next half is planned for then in Bentonville, AR.

### Training
My previous 10K PR was an accidental PR in January 2020, after having a particularly strong winter running block and a strong Americano an hour before, I went out for a run and hit my first mile at 6:00 even, and figured, ""Hell, why not?""  Wound up clocking in a 10K at 37:25 (on Nike Run Club, pre-Strava for me), and felt pretty great about it.  That style of ""just running but always running hard"" led me to a string of injuries afterwards; right hip flexor issues in May, right sciatic nerve issues in September, immediately followed by left ITBS, then left Achilles tendonitis, before finally returning to regular running late January 2021.  I'm injury prone clearly, likely a result of compensating for two ACL reconstructions while running with a weaker core &amp; glutes than I needed to sustain that level, along with not taking my easy days easy.

Started training in earnest for this 10K on March 2nd, and followed [this training plan](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/10km/a760074/rws-8-week-10k-schedule-6-7-days-per-week/) fairly well.  In hindsight, I think the number of hard days on this plan are a bit too many, as there were two non-consecutive weeks I skipped a speed workout in favor of easy miles that amounted to what I would have run.  I calculated some of my track paces using McMillan with a goal of sub-36, but found that when I actually did those workouts my paces were much faster than what the estimator suggested.  About 3 weeks ago, I started to seriously think sub-35 was just within reach and began mentally prepping for that.

I dealt with some little aches and pains here and there throughout, but nothing that sidelined me for more than a day, and even in those cases, it was more about listening to my body rather than focusing on the plan too much.  However, this week my right calf felt like it was knotted on Wednesday during my easy run, and I opted to skip Thursday's run for rest.  Yesterday, I did an easy 4 mile shakeout, and found that 1) my right calf still felt tight, but worse, 2) my left Achilles was flaring up a little.  I spent the day *not* poking and prodding it, just resting, did some light Alfredson Protocol eccentric heel drops later in the day, and that seemed to help physically, but mentally I was definitely shaken.

### Pre-race
Today I woke up ~30 minutes before my alarm but feeling rested, and immediately asked myself how the Achilles felt; if you've never experienced this kind of mentality, it's torture.  [This write up on Tempo Journal](https://tempojournal.com/article/knock-me-down/index.html) has a pretty jarring line for what it's like; ""...it's emotionally exhausting... ...[to] wake up every morning and immediately think, *'How does it feel today.'*""  Well, that's where I was today, but thankfully it felt great.  I woke up, drank some water and a sport drink w/ caffeine, taped up my Achilles just in case, and started mentally relaxing and physically waking up.  After an hour of trying to psych myself out of it, I got in my kit, warmed up (lunge matrix &amp; leg swings), and did a light warm up mile over to the start of my 2mi loop.

### Race
After *again* trying to psych myself out of running it today, I finally said ""Fuck it,"" lined up, and pressed start on my watch.  My pre-race plan had been to negative split it at 5:43 - 5:40 - 5:35 - 5:30 - 5:30 - &lt;5:30 to finish.  I definitely got too excited off the line, and spent the first mile telling myself, ""relax, relax, fluid, controlled.""  The first mile came back at 5:35, and I thought, *Shit, well...  Might as well hold this now.*

My course was a 2mi loop in my neighborhood, which I ran in the bike lane against traffic.  Turns out that today was also the virtual Pat's Run (if you're not from AZ, it's a ~4mi race to honor the life of Pat Tillman), so there were more runners out than the usual Saturday groups.

After 3 miles, I definitely started getting the head-demons telling me, *It's just a time trial, who cares?  Just slow down, it doesn't matter if you stop.*  Every time I saw the pace hold at sub-5:40 and then the miles click back with that nice 5:3x time kept me pushing.  On the final lap, I just kept digging deep and finding more, which was nice to experience.  On the last half mile, I tried to give it my best knowing that I only had a few more minutes.  Not wanting to stop anywhere short of the 10K line, I pushed through until I saw 6.25 when I hit stop, saw my elapsed time (34:52) and let myself celebrate.  Strava reported the exact 10K time was 34:39, so a 21 second lead from my goal, along with a 2:45 minute or so PR.

### Post-race
I walked back to my house, switched out to a t-shirt and easy day shoes, drank some water, texted my results to a few close friends, then went back out for a 1mi cool down jog.  My Achilles definitely feels tight, but it's not hurting at least, so I'll be spending the next few weeks performing the full Alfredson Protocol two times a day while also letting myself take time off if it feels weird.

Overall, I'm thrilled to have mentally tackled something that I thought could have been just out of reach.  This summer I'll be focusing on building on this fitness though (after I make sure my body is totally right &amp; set).  During the TT, I hit a new 5K PR of 17:13, so I'm thinking sub-17 is doable, along with a sub-5 mile.  My main goals though will be to stay healthy, and then I'll be starting up a Pfitzinger plan for the AZ Rock n Roll Marathon in January, which'll be my first.  Publicly, my goal is to BQ, but given today's results, there will definitely be a secret goal or two past that.

Thanks for reading!  Alternatively, **TL;DR - followed a 10K training plan, eyed a goal time that intimidated me, threw myself at it, wound up crushing it.**

AdvancedRunning,Free_Running_Plans,So You Want To Run Cross Country (or Distance Running) in College?,"Hi r/AdvancedRunning,

I wrote a (lengthy) blog post a few years back regarding running in college, recruitment process, and considerations for HS athletes. Some of it still seems It still seems relevant now so I provided the text version in a post over on r/CrossCountry. Some info may is outdated, but I wanted to provide whatever information I could as a former D1 XC runner, NCAA qualifier, and HS/college coach. 

Years later, I am finally getting around to working on a 2nd version to provide more up-to-date and accurate information. I am only getting further and further removed from the college recruitment process and collegiate running scene, and would **GREATLY appreciate any feedback** to make it a better and more accurate resource this time around.

Any feedback is appreciated. If you don't feel comfortable posting, feel free to reach out individually as well. 

(Note: Mods, I have not linked to my blog/site. Any links provided were references used in the blog from NCAA and such. If those aren't permitted - please feel free to remove).

\--------------------------------------------

Many athletes want to consider whether or not competing in college is an option for them, but don’t know where to begin. I wanted to put together a detailed breakdown so you know exactly what to expect if you wish to pursue athletic competition for Cross Country or Distance Running in college.

To start, the most important thing is finding a college that fits you. Put your academics and own self growth above competing at a University. If you broke your leg the first week on campus, would you still be happy with your choice? Things to consider when looking at the mass amount of colleges:

⁃ In-State vs Out of State

⁃ Do you want to live in a big city or small town?

⁃ Major University vs Small School

⁃ Private vs Public

⁃ Admissions Standards

⁃ Cost of Tuition 

⁃ Financial Aid packages offered.

⁃ Majors/Departments (Do they offer what you want to study?)

⁃ Alumni Network

You can find all of this information for schools at websites like [www.PrincetonReview.com.](http://www.princetonreview.com./) In addition to the items listed above, it also includes acceptance rates, breakdown of GPA, 25-75th percentile ACT/SAT, Cost of tuition, average financial aid package, etc. It’s never too early to start reviewing what schools interest you. If you’re traveling you may want to stop and visit a prospective schools as you’re passing through.

**Understanding Collegiate Athletics:** 

The primary association of collegiate sports is the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). There are three tiers of competition within this organization:

Division 1: 

• Largest universities and the overall highest level of collegiate athletics. 

• The majority of state and large universities are Division 1.

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track &amp; Field and 18.0 for women XC/Track &amp; Field. 

• Majority of schools have a Track &amp; Field Program

• Note: Schools in the Ivy League (Harvard, Brown, etc) do NOT offer any athletic scholarship.

• Example D1 Schools: Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Clemson, Texas, Harvard, South Carolina, Tennessee, Baylor, Stanford, 

Division 2: 

• Smaller schools and generally less known

• Overall less competitive than Division 1

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track &amp; Field and 12.6 athletic scholarship for women’s XC/Track &amp; Field. 

• Usually have smaller rosters than D1 thus easier to receive scholarship.

• Includes mostly private schools so tuition may be higher.

• Many do not have a Track &amp; Field Program.

Division 3:

• Small schools and generally private

• No athletic scholarships 

• D3 schools can be just as competitive as Division 2 despite no athletic scholarship. This is due to several more prestigious schools being D3 such as Johns Hopkins, MIT, NYU, and Carnegie Mellon. Athletes may use their ability to assist them gaining admission into the school.

• On average have larger team size than D2

• Example Schools: Johns Hopkins, Haverford, Geneseo Street, Calvin, St. Lawrence, Wisconsin Platteville, Wisconsin Stevens Point, Dickinson, Washington-St. Louis, New York University, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, 

There are also some other organizations that offer athletics. This includes:

NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics): 

• Smaller 4-year colleges

• Less strict requirements to compete.

• There are equally talented players in the NAIA and NCAA D2 schools

NJCAA (Junior College):

• Junior/2-year colleges

• Small Team sizes

• Can offer athletic scholarship.

• Very loose requirements to compete. For example, any student may compete as long as they have not previously competed in intercollegiate competition. Technically, even parents could compete for these schools if they attended them.

• Generally used as a stepping stone. Athletes will often attend Junior College (JUCO) to improve grades before attending a 4-year university. It’s is a good way to save a lot of money by getting your Associates Degree (AA) before receiving your Bachelors at a 4-year University.

**Scholarship Information** 

Only 7.0% for male high school XC athletes and 8.6% for female high school XC athletes will compete at the varsity collegiate level. Only 1.8% of male XC athletes and 2.5% of female XC athletes will compete at the highest level (NCAA Division 1). While the odds may seem tough, it’s certainly not impossible if it’s something you wish to do as there are many different levels.

People tend to think all athletic scholarships as only “full ride” (full scholarship) or “walk on” (no athletic scholarship). In Cross Country/Track &amp; Field, D1/D2 schools are limited as to how much athletic scholarship they can give out while D3 offers no athletic scholarships. D1, for example, only has 12.6 male scholarships and 18.0 female scholarships to field both their XC and Track &amp; Field rosters. If you consider this is generally broken up into 4 years, there is usually only about 3-4 full scholarships available for each genders incoming freshman class. This is to fund an entire Cross Country/Track &amp; Field team which can be as many as 50-60 athletes. In short, a full athletic scholarship is extremely rare in XC/Track &amp; Field and scholarships are generally broken up into many partial scholarships (15%, 20% etc).

Instead of looking towards a rare athletic full ride, you need to consider the entire financial package. After all, you may still end up with a very good portion of your college being paid. Things outside of athletic scholarship to consider are:

⁃ Academic Aid

⁃ Grants

⁃ Need based Aid

⁃ Outside Scholarships

⁃ Florida Bright Futures (or similar in-state programs)

⁃ In-State vs Out of State Tuition (i.e: UF tuition is $6,381 per year for Florida residents while it’s $28,658 for out-of-state students)

⁃ Public vs Private (Private schools can get VERY expensive but often offer better academic aid packages to bring the cost down).

So overall, athletic aid is just a portion of your financial consideration. If you were to get a partial scholarship you may receive other grants, academic scholarships, and need based scholarships that covers the majority of your tuition.

**Standards for Competing in College:**

There is a wide variety of athletes that compete across all divisions in college. Here is a very general breakdown of the average athlete in each division. Note: Coaches will not always consider your XC time because courses and conditions can be so different. Just because you run a specific time on one occasion doesn’t mean you meet a specific programs requirement. Similarly, if you don’t run one of the specified times below, it doesn’t automatically disqualify you from every program in that division. I have also included a breakdown of track mid-distance to distance times. The track times listed are aggressive/faster as they are the range for an athletic scholarship requirement for each division. 

Once again, if you don’t have those exact times, it by no means disqualifies you as there is a wide variety of teams/programs in each division with different standards and depends on whether or not you are looking towards athletic scholarship. The best thing you can do is contact a schools coach to see exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a very broad breakdown of the type fo athletes schools in each division is looking from, as seen on: [http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:](http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:)

**How &amp; When To Begin The Recruiting Process:** 

Division 1 and Division 2 coaches are not permitted to call or email you prior to the start of your Junior Year. 

Division 3 coaches can contact you as a junior in high school.

The recruiting process is generally straight forward in cross country (and track &amp; field) compared to some sports. For example, in many team sports, you are expected to attend specific tournaments, send game film of yourself, attend camps, etc. The college coaches need to see you play (often several times) in order to determine if you are the right fit for their team. In addition to this, there are many variables such as the quality of the opponent, quality of your own team, etc. It can be a challenge to set yourself apart - especially at the highest level.

For cross country and track &amp; field it is quite a bit simpler. You can let your times and/or finishes at the state meet do the talking for you. Track times for distance events, as well as XC times, can be sent to the coach and they will have a solid understanding of your ability. In fact, many college teams will even list specific time standards they are looking for.

Generally, it falls on you as an athlete to make the first move. The ideal scenario is as follows:

• Create a list of 5-10 schools (or more) that interest you. 

• Visit the cross country and/or track &amp; field section of their athletic website

• See if they have time standards to make their team. If not, look through their roster, last years’ results to try get an idea of the general range they are looking for. If a team is comprised of all athletes who ran a 16:00 5k or faster in high school, there’s no point wasting your time if you’ve only run 18:30 for 5k.

• Go to PrincetonReview.com to see if you are a good fit for the school academically, financially, etc. 

• If you align with a school academically, athletically, financially, then fill out the Cross Country or Track &amp; Field Recruiting questionnaire. Most schools will have this listed, but if there is no questionnaire then email the coach directly. Write a personalized email - no generic templates.

• Get certified by the NCAA Eligibility Center ([https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):](https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):) REQUIRED for official visits or to sign a National letter of intent.

If your XC/Track &amp; Field times, GPA, SAT/ACT Scores interest the coach, they may call you and begin the recruiting process. Recruiting services are a rip-off for cross country and a waste of time. Everything can and should be done by yourself. I can also help in any way possible, although I often just look through the teams website and school info on Princeton review to create a breakdown like below (something you can certainly do by yourself as well):

University of South Florida

⁃ Enrollment: 48,793 

⁃ 47% acceptance rate

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Reading: 530-620

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Math: 540-630

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Writing: 510-600 

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile ACT: 24-28 

⁃ In-State Tuition - $6,336/Year

⁃ On Campus Room &amp; Board: $9,700

⁃ NCAA Division 1

⁃ Wide range of athletes, but girls HS 5k PRs generally range from 20:30-21:00. 

⁃ You can see their 2016 results here: [http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578](http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578)

⁃ Recruiting Questionnaire: [https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&amp;SPORTID=58](https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&amp;SPORTID=58)

⁃ Does have a track &amp; field team

You may receive letters in the mail. This is often a mailing blast sent to hundreds of athletes. You still need to fill out the questionnaire or email the coach to continue the recruiting process.

**Continuing Communication:**

When contacting coaches, they want to hear from YOU - not your parents and not your coaches. Ultimately, you are the one that will be attending the school so you should be the one communicating with them. If they want to talk with your parents or coaches, they will certainly find a way to do so.

When making the initial contact with the coach, you have to realize they may be hearing from hundreds of athletes. Keep the email concise and list your PRs, State Meet Finishes, and GPA/Test Scores. Coaches don't have time to read a long-winded email about your work ethic and being vice president of the key club. Consider your email like a resume: keep it short and quickly detail your accomplishments within a paragraph of two.

If a coach calls you on the phone, they have a certain degree of interest in you. Do not be afraid to ask questions! They will often dictate the conversations but may ask questions about your training (how many miles you run), upcoming races, what you’re looking for in a school, etc. Sometimes athletes get nervous or the phone call doesn’t go as planned. If you have spoken to a coach, it doesn’t hurt to reach out to them and reiterate your interest, ask any questions you may have forgotten, and continue the conversation. Remember, they will be contacting MANY athletes.

If you have no interest in the school whatsoever, let the coach know. Maybe the school is out of state while you’re certain you want to stay in-state. It may be a different division than you want to compete in. Whatever the reason, if you’re certain you don’t want to attend their school there is no point wasting both of your time. Let them know. They won't take it personally and will simply move onto the next athlete.

After several phone calls, a coach may invite you to attend the school on an “official visit”.  This is an all expenses paid visit to the school where they will show you the campus, introduce you to the team, coaches, training staff, academic advisors, etc. In short, it’s an extended campus visit that the school pays for. You are only permitted to take 5 official visits.

Alternatively, they may ask you to come visit “unofficially”. This may apply if you’re racing at the school during a weekend and they just want to meet you face to face.

During the entire recruiting process and even now, it’s important you are careful what you post on social media. Just as you are considering the school as a complete package, the coach is considering you in the same way. Coaches will often look through your social media accounts to see if you are the type of athlete and person that’s right for their program. Posting ridiculous things on your Twitter, Instagram, etc could cost you scholarship money or even a spot on a team you are interested in.

Between NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, there are over 1,200 men’s XC programs and over 1,300 women’s XC program. If competing in college is something you aspire to do, work on getting your times down and find the program that fits you best. Above all, find the school that suits you and where you can see yourself growing academically and as a person.

**Quotes from college coaches themselves** (from athleticscholarships.com):

As stated by Florida State’s head coach Bob Braman:

“It's very important for high school athletes to understand that our sport is very objective and that times, distances, etc. can be measured against other athletes all over the world.  The reality is major college programs like ours will not recruit athletes with “untapped potential”.  We want the best of the best and then we’ll separate them based on coaching , competition, etc.

Always look on the universities’ athletic webpage and see if they list scholarship standards.  Even if they don’t be sure to only contact those that fit your talents. Always send a personalized e-mail to either the head coach or event coach.  In the e-mail you should include best performances / marks and SAT/ACT/GPA information.

Biggest misconception is that we’re like Football.  Track and Field is limited to 12.6 scholarships for men and 18 scholarships for women.  With 19 events plus cross country to cover that means that full scholarships are extremely rare”

The head coach, Brenden Rickert, from D1 school Fairfield University (in Connecticut), states:

“Know the school you're applying to - don't write a generic email to every coach. Look at the times and/or performances of athletes currently on the roster to see how you compare. If you're way off, chances are you will not be on the team.

Don't use a recruiting service - times and performances don't lie so we do not need to see a video of you running. Do not give us times that cannot be found on a legitimate website, we will assume they are wrong.  Fairfield University

Update 1-2 times per week. There's dozens of you and only a couple coaches, so the more you update the more you're on our radar. Prepare and ask questions- we want you to make the best decision for you. Let the coach know if you're no longer interested in the school.

Enjoy the process, it's a whirlwind but if you do it right, you'll have some amazing experiences that you'll remember for the rest of your life.”

AdvancedRunning,stoutrunning,Incorporate ultra training into a half marathon plan?,"**Background:**

Male, mid-20s. Running 80+ mpw (on average, but generally inconsistent training the last 4-5 months)

**Context:**

I’m a couple weeks into building my base which I will continue for another 5ish weeks and then potentially “race” a 10k end of May, depending on whether or not I feel like racing, just to have some type of idea where I’m at. 

Then I’ll take a couple days off and begin to start a 16 week block for a half marathon. My A+ goal is sub-70, with a more achievable goal of going 1:12 which I’d still be content with. My ideal plan is to average 90-100 mpw and 2-3 half marathon specific sessions/week. 

My last real race was 4 years ago where I ran 2:42 in my first marathon on averaging about 60-65 mpw (but also an excessively absurd amount of XT) and really only 3 or 4 sessions over the entire 12 week block. I’m confident I can handle 90+ mpw now and if I run actual workouts during training I think 72 minutes is possible. 

**Question:**

No concrete plans for what I’d like to do after the half, but I know that at some point I’d like to enter some 50Ks and maybe 100Ks as well, with the goal of really racing and running them competitively (versus just running them with a goal to finish them).

Is it possible to incorporate some training for a 50K into my half marathon training in a way that wouldn’t be too counterproductive? I think most weeks my half marathon training long run will be 18+ miles with another medium long run at 15+. Would a biweekly or monthly 50K specific workout get in the way of my half marathon goals or would it be possible to fit in?

I haven’t looked at 50K specific workouts, but was thinking something along the lines of like a 24 mile long run with 8 mile WU and 4 x (2 miles at 50K pace, 1 mile easy), 4 mile CD.",1619262850

AdvancedRunning,CosmotheSloth,Running with heart block &amp; bradycardia,"Hi everyone,

Sorry if this isn't the best place to put this but I thought this might be a good community to ask seeing as though most of you will be somewhat similar to myself in terms of exercise regimes.

For context for this post, I'm male, 28, and usually run 70-80 km per week (which includes 2 quality sessions and a long run). To give an idea of intensity of workouts, run a 5K in about 18:30, my easy runs are anything from 4:40-5:15 min/km, and my long runs are usually 21-28 km.

So about a year ago I started getting some mild heart symptoms that I thought I should get checked out. They were mild/moderate flutters or beat skips that usually were followed by a big heart beat afterwards. I got them checked out with an ECG and 48 hour Holt monitor and received a letter telling me that I have Mobitz type 2 heart block and that there was some evidence of my heart slowing down at various points throughout the day (bradycardia I think?). There was no advice associated with the letter, only a telephone appointment with a consultant for 4 months time, so I assumed everything was fine and I've been trying as normal ever since (and my symptoms are pretty much fine - occasional flare ups but mostly very mild and very irregular).

Flash forward to today I had my telephone appointment and the consultant. He said my heart looked healthy and he explained the heart block situation (for which he didn't seem overly concerned about, he just attributed it to my exercise) and all seemed well. However, he then said that as I was showing some slowing of the heart during the day in my Holt monitor test, he's concerned that if that were to continue and my heart kept getting slower I might need a pacemaker. As a result, he said I should change my current exercise regime so that I run no more than 3-5 km at any one time, and just do it to a really high intensity. Obviously this is a huge departure from what I'm currently doing and would be a massive negative for me, mostly in terms of my mental health as I enjoy my long runs and the amount I run so much (he was effectively saying cut my total weekly distance to max 30 km).

Given how my symptoms have settled and how it doesn't effect my exercise at all, this all seems a bit extreme of a change to me so I was wondering if anyone else had any similar experiences to this? If so, have you changed what you do? If not, how have you faired? I'm reluctant to change something that I enjoy so much and seems to keep so fit and well for the sake of some occasional mild heart palpitations...

### Training
2020, like most people, was not the year, nor the year of running I expected it to be. While I did run 2 ultra distances, I also got overwhelmed by the stress of life and took almost a whole month off from running. As December came around, I reached out to a friend who is an ultra coach to try and become competent at the 50K distance. His suggestion was to run a road marathon, as that would make a trail 50K not feel so bad. So starting the last week of January, I started training for a marathon. I started running 7 days a week to get in my volume while working 40+ hours a week, and going to grad school part time. The structure of our training was great because of the simplicity. Each week had a mileage goal, an uphill strides day, a workout day, and a prescribed long run. This just meant I had to fit the volume in around those days, which was perfect for my life. A month of training went by, with my first time running 50mpw. I was not just doing well with 50mpw, I was thriving. Then my marathon got canceled, so I abandoned dreams of running a fast BQ time (this in itself is a feat, I live at over 6000ft so I have to travel far to find a fast marathon). I spent my time staying at the mileage, hitting longer tempos, and running vert as the trails opened up. I conquered my fear of bigger mileage and long runs in one training cycle! I even also got a run streak of 69 days. I also ran a new 5K PR of 18:54, smashing my previous year's record of 19:38. I had currently two goals, both being two 50 milers later in the year. I thought it would be nice to run a 50K before them to get some practice with fueling and running long. The opportunity came very unexpectedly.

### Pre-race
I went to visit Fruita CO, about 4 hours away, during work's spring break to go run some dry trails with my wife. I met up with a friend of mine who had just moved there the summer before to get a lay of the land. He was our run club's prior president, and I took the VP role as he stepped away. Unintentionally, other friends from my town were coming up to Fruita to run trails. They had signed up for a trail marathon that was in the area the following month and wanted to preview the course. I thought, ""it would be fun to get to run this race with friends, but I bet it's full."" Since I assumed it's full, I didn't even try. 2 weeks later, Tailwind reaches out saying they have 10 free entries to any of their ambassadors who want them. Naturally, I say yes, but it was all contingent if I would get the work covered. I try the next two weeks asking many a co worker if they could cover this shift, but no luck. I believe there's no way I can run this race, until monday of the race week, a co worker says they'll do it! I am astonished as I hastily get that squared away, make plans to crash on couch (I am vaccinated, as well as everyone at said house) and drive up that day solo (since my MiL was flying in Saturday evening, my wife needed to stay to pick her up from the airport). So I drive up, get my packet (which almost didn't happen because initially they couldn't find my registration from the code the RD gave me), and get dinner. As we're talking and just hanging out we begin to discuss getting out there. I was going to take the bus, but then my friend informs me that the general 50K wave start almost an hour after the elite and marathon starts. This meant for an even longer day for me. And my friend Sean, a very accomplished ultra runner and coach, talk about the race, he suggests that I should start in the elite 50K wave. I say he's crazy, because I'm not fast. He asks what I want to run and I think back to my first 50K in Moab. I ran 5:48 and I am waaay fitter than that November 2 years prior. I think to myself that the gain (3500) would be mild (it wasn't) so I guess 5 hours? Sean then informs me that the elite wave is for people who think they'll finish in the top 20 of their race. He informs me that a 5 hour 50K will do the trick. After a quick chat with my wife, I commit to the early start. The morning routine, overnight oats and coffee, go down easy as we leave at 6am for the start. We arrive at 6:20 and wait. While I'm there, I see tons of hella fast looking people, and even Clare Gallager (small fanboy moment happened). I poop for like the 4th time that morning and get ready to race.

### Race
The Desert RATS 50K starts on a road. I knew the first mile was gonna be fast, so I do my best to hold back. Sean has completed 196 ultras before this one, so I figure if I stick with him, I'll be ok. We take it nice and easy before we hit a super steep climb. Thanks to running with Sean the month prior, I was familiar with half the trails we were runnin that day. My plan was to take the first zone 1 effort, and then push it in the second half. First run into the mile 5 aid goes without hitch or effort. Lots of jockeying for position on the single track. 50Kers hit a flat loop section and I'm feeling fine. The technical early miles were passed and I was just under 90 minutes for 9 miles. I'm pleasantly surprised that I'm hitting this 5 hours goal, but I know the race is super early on. I fill up on water, tailwind, and down coke at the aid stations. They were basically all 6 miles apart from each other. Disaster strikes inbetween aid as I fart like 11 miles in, but a little bit more that comes out, leaving me with some booty crack chafing. The fun and glorious side of ultra running. I hold it together until the next aid station, where I hide behind a bush while I clean up. I keep moving on, feeling much better. This race snaked along a canyon and cliff ridges, allowing plenty of time to see the course in front, or behind you. Right around mile 15 I hear my name from across the canyon. It's Sean! He's gotten close, and this competitive desire to beat me emerges from within. Perfect timing is what I think as I begin to push the pace. 5 more miles go by without incident but the course moves from its middle rolling section to the climbs. I am so thrilled that 20 miles in I am feeling as good as I do. As we begin to approach the mile 25 aid station, I can start feeling the fatigue of pounding over rocks starting to take its toll, but I'm moving well. I keep passing marathon and 50K runners. This is where I make a mistake. I only fill one tailwind bottle, have one cup of water, and then coke. It was at this point the race, the wind died and the steepest 1.5 mile climb of the race happened. I start worrying a mile in, realising I'm far past the point of return, and I should have been better hydrated and filled with more fuel. It's at this same time, I hear from behind me ""What is this, the Durango Walking Club?"" Sean has caught me, and I shake my head in frustration. There's not much I can do until we finish the climb to continue to push forward. I get to flats and rolling and I'm able to get myself moving. The race snakes from the top of the mesa, which is a total tease, making me think the finish is closer than I thought. But I finally get there, and finish only 3 minutes behind Sean in a time of 5:30:55. 

### Post-race
I spent a minute or two on the ground before I get myself moving and put on some layers. As the pain in my legs increases, so does the wind, so I'm getting pretty cold. The worst part really was the 1 mile walk to the car, but I am thankful for the company of my friends. I am hurting, but so thrilled at how strong I felt for 90% of my race. The last miles are a bit more training and changing of fueling strategy, namely sticking with the strategy that was working. After crushing this, I can't wait to go back to that 50K in Moab to see what speed I can actually put down, and see how the 50 milers go. The drive back is uneventful, as I load up on fast food and coffee, jamming out to playlists while I do my best to not cramp up in my car.

AdvancedRunning,macman104,PT says lay off running for now - 4 weeks to big race week (reassurance/advice welcome!),"2 weeks ago I had some calf nagging/tightness. It went away part way through my long run...this was my 2nd week of my last 3-week peak phase. 3rd week of peak, calf tightness cut a few midweek runs short, saw my PT day before last weekend long run, and was told if I can skip, I can run. 2 miles into final weekend long runs (24/20), calf tightness comes up again and it hurts to skip, so I walk back home.

So final 3 weeks of peak were unfortunately: 76, 73, 25 :/

Now I'm in my planned recovery week and the issue is persisting to the point I cannot run without calf pain. PT has told me no more running until I get my stabilization/strength sorted. We've narrowed it down to nerve inflammation in hip that is causing calf issues, there is no acute injury, it is not muscle tightness that is solved by foam rolling (obviously, I'm not physio expert, so I'm probably not explaining that perfectly), but I trust their judgement on the diagnostic part of this matter.

**In any case**, the main reason for coming here is some advice on what to do in the meantime. Final weeks of my plan was: recover this week, then 65mi week, 42, then race week. PT said it could be 1 week or it could be 3 weeks before back to full/partial running, just hard to know. PT is not overly worried (yet) that I'll be able to race, which speaking of race, it is 7 days, 7 marathons throughout Northeast US. (google New England Challenge if you are curious)

I have access to a gym, I can spin/swim indoor and I have a road bike if I want to head outdoors on the weekends. We also have a decent amount of trails for hiking nearby. Right now I'm trying not to panic about losing all my training adaptation over the next few weeks :) 

So...reassurance and/or cross-training advice in this ill-timed down period?",1619139243

First post here, Im excited. I have my first flat 1/2M race coming up In 3 weeks and am trying to figure out what pace I should aim for. Im reasonably fit, training for an IM70.3 at about 10-12h/week total.

Age: 28
Workouts: 1 tempo, 1 long run, 1 speed work
Run specific volume: 3 runs, 4-5h, 40-50km /week
5k PB (recent): 19:54 (I had nothing left after it)
1/2M training runs: 1:53:29 @Zone2/3 mostly

The theory says I should be able to do a 1:30 1/2M but personally I feel a 1:32 to 1:35 time is more reasonable. My pain threshold is good, but running at 4:15min/km is gonna have me just below threshold for the whole duration - possible?

AdvancedRunning,cajuntits,10k/HM training,"Hello all, first post here. 21y/o F
I’ve been running for about 2 years now, usually 4 miles about 3 times a week and then a longer run of 6-8 miles 1x a week.
I’ve been reading about building aerobic endurance through low effort and training at 60-70 of V02 max and most of my workouts are done at about 180bpm avg. Am I supposed to slow down for aerobic endurance workouts while HR decreases over time? Should I be trying out couch to HM training plans even though I’m not exactly a “couch potato” ? lol

Also how did everyone who was a casual runner start out their HM training? I’m just confused on how and where to start in terms of distances and effort. I do incorporate strength/cycling into other days I’m not running and of course a recovery day. Just looking for tips and general advice since I’ve read so many articles at this point that I feel like I need some “informal” advice if that makes sense. 

Also random q, do y’all switch out running shoes during the week and if so, do you guys have the same model just different color or two diff models. I’m thinking of training on the treadmill as well since it’s a better way of controlling pace while I start training but I feel like I might want to switch to lower cushion shoes (i currently have brooks adrenaline gts21)

AdvancedRunning,FrostyAfternoon,How to recover from over training?,"I suspect I’m overtraining because my heart rate has been incredibly high the past week or so, alongside with my “easy” runs feeling sluggish.

My easy pace is about 8:30-9. My 5k is around 19 minutes and moderate runs are around 7 to 7:30. Tempos are at 6:15-6:30 pace.

I’m 20 years old, and my bpm is usually 160-170 on moderate runs/tempos. They used to be about 140-150 on my easy runs. 

Unfortunately my easy runs now climb up to the 170s and 180s, despite how slow I’m going. I’ve once slowed down to an 11min/mi pace and it was still around 170 bpm. Maybe it’s the chance in weather?

AdvancedRunning,trucki03,Looking for shoe fit advice,"Hi everyone, first post here, and hoping i'm in the right place for shoe choice advice. 

Because of the covid restrictions I'm unable to go to my usual dealer who usually helps me choose a fitting running shoe. I currently run with a pair of [Mizuno Wave Shadow 3](https://emea.mizuno.com/eu/fr-fr/wave-shadow-3/J1GC1930.html)  which are great for medium distances (up to 20km) and some speed work. For those who aren't familiar, they're a pretty lightweight and reactive shoe. Cushioning is pretty minimal, which I'm pretty happy about as I currently not prone to knee injuries (touch wood). For context I'm a 21M who has a few years' worth of running experience (39min 10k, 18min 5k) and run about 40-50km/week. I'm aiming for sub-90' on my next half marathon. 

However I'm looking for a shoe for longer distances (say from 20km to 42km). The trouble is I don't quite know what I'm looking for. I'm doing longer runs with [Solomon Speedcross](https://www.salomon.com/fr-fr/shop-emea/product/speedcross-5-w.html?CMPID=ps%7cdy%7cgoogle%7cFR_FR_GOO_DSA_PERF_GEN_Footwear%7cFR_FR_DSA_PERF_All-shoes%7c%7c428678212213&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvYSEBhDjARIsAJMn0lh3eBJew6NXxjFt6Zz0q6UeUppws-wNrmo9gOfeMrAhy5lEIfMor0gaAijXEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#color=32637) but they're really not great for long distances (stiff; poor cushioning). I'm eyeing the [Adidas Boston](https://www.adidas.fr/adizero_boston) but not sure whether this will fit. 

My question to you experts is what should I be looking for in a shoe regarding overpronation/supination (how do i even find out whether i'm one or the other), fit (I'm a ""mizuno 44.5""), and cushioning. 

I appreciate that this is a very open question, but to provide a **tl;dr**, what do i need to look out for when buying a shoe online, and how do I know whether it will fit? Because of covid, trying them out before buying them isn't possible. I run mainly on some trails (nothing crazy) and road.

AdvancedRunning,Kaboum-,My thoughts on Running Stress Scores and injury reduction,"As we all know, running is notorious for having the highest injury rate among endurance sports. It's mostly due to bad running technique, lack of strength exercising and progressively accumulating junk miles, and useless training stress. 

I spent so much time, effort, and money trying to figure out how to measure running stress as accurately and precisely as possible. Here are the fruits of my labor.

&amp;#x200B;

* Cycling science made the biggest jump in quantifying stress by finding your FTP and calculating TSS from it based on Functional threshold power (FTP), Intensity Factor (IF), and Normalized Power (NP) 

# Running 

When it comes to running, pace/speed is what matters the most to runners and attempts have been implemented to apply the same methodology used in cycling for running (except Stryd; more on that below), but at this time, power measurements for running power are not that accurate nor that reliable. 

So other conduits for performance have been used to quantify stress as accurately and precisely as possible, all of which can be used, but with an understanding of the underlying assumptions and how to use them. 

* hrTSS (heart rate stress score): the least accurate of them all; depends on HR and relationship with lactate threshold. Not used that much given the variability and inconsistency of heart rate-related measurements and just the mere fluctuations of heart rate that are not due to exercise. 
* rTSS (Running stress score): use a similar formula, but employs graded pace in place of FTP (means pace adjusted for grade, which can be calculated by most running watches). But it does not count the effects of wind, running form, and temperature, among other variables that are not possible to calculate (as of the technology we have so far)
* Stryd Critical Power: uses their formula to calculate running stress score (RSS) based on Critical Power (similar to FTP); calculated using their own testing protocol, and so far this approach seems the most accurate (so far!). 

Now after you chose whichever method to quantify stress, you can apply it to a stress curve that monitors how much stress you supposedly accumulated during your training. 

It works for cycling and multiple studies have shown power-based plans are far more superior compared to other methods, while running power is not that accurate, I feel it is the future going forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you guys think; as I personally noted clear improvement when training power-based with fewer injuries compared just to only pace-based.",1619045006

AdvancedRunning,wwcoop,Blood in pee after running from kidney stones,"Sometimes after running I have blood in my pee. It isn't consistent. Most times none at all, but at least once a week this happens, usually after a long run (13+ miles). Never after a short run (8 miles) I am pretty sure this is due to kidney stone(s). It isn't painful and it clears up after. I don't ever have blood in my pee otherwise.

I have a history of this in the past. I (very painfully) passed one right after a marathon two years ago. For the most part I just ignore it. I haven't passed any stones for 2 years. I am on the fence about going to a Urologist which I have done for kidney stones in the past. They would likely put me on Flomax and/or recommend lithotripsy (break them up with sound waves) if I go after getting scan after confirming what I pretty much already know - I have one or a few stones.

I was just curious whether any of you have or have had similar and what you suggest. I'm not in any discomfort. Just alarming to see this when it happens and a not so subtle reminder that I will probably be passing another stone sometime in the near future.",1619026787

It's super demoralizing to be doing so well and then feeling like I lost all my progress.

AdvancedRunning,DougPiranha42,Pace and training for trail runs with elevation gain," Hi AR! I have a question about trail running. I have been running for about 2 years and I completed a few races, but only started following a training plan (and lurking this sub) 2 months ago. I particularly like running trails in the hills, and my goal is to improve my time on trail HM and eventually Marathon races. In my area, courses typically include some climbing (1500 ft elevation gain and loss for a HM). I don't have too much time to commit, so what I've been doing is two workouts (intervals or tempo) on road during the week, and my long run on trail in the weekend. I wouldn't call these long runs easy (avg HR 80-90%), but I don't typically have a target pace. Next weekend, I'd like to run a 10k TT on trail with proportional elevation gain to help setting my targets.

My question is: how do I set my pace in terrain with hills? Or should I just target a heart rate? I've tried the PacePro planner that comes with my Garmin, but the slope-adjusted paces are ridiculous. For example, for a target pace of 9:30 (which is easy enough on a plain road), it suggests to slow down to 11:35 on the steepest climbs, where I can barely do 15 with an all-out effort. How can I find the best pace, or level of effort, for a course with steep climbs and downhill sections? And more generally, what training plans would you recommend for trail running. Is the training different at all from road running?

I'm 35M, 15 Mpw (determined to increase this slowly, because I had injuries before when I bumped it unprepared), and I have time for 3 runs per week.

Begin Rant:

Ran into a new injury last July when increasing distance and intensity. Post tib flared up after a hills session and it was painful even to walk for a while. Sucks but I've been here before with other lower leg injuries. I rest, pull back the miles by about half and take up the bike and barbells more. The pain subsided but the ghost of discomfort always felt like it was about to cross back into ""owch."" I was not able to train speedwork in earnest til October. By January I was feeling good again and was back up to steady 30 mile weeks plus some easy speed work, and approaching a one year PB for a 5k without really training that distance hard.

Well late January it came back, so we repeat that cycle. Feelin good by March I increase again (always slowly and cautiously). Now it's back again and it's just so frustrating. While I like getting acquainted with by bikes, my longtime fitness goals are all running. I stretch and roll and do the alphabet and myrtl and heel dips and therapy exercises but the injury is so stubborn.

As usual the internet is confusing on the subject. You should keep running, NO  you should not run at all. Go to your therapy, NO PTs really don't know how to solve this issue. RICE, NO don't RICE, HEAT! Eat turmeric? It's all static at this point.

**Where: Mclaren Vale, South Australia**

**Goal: Sub 1.15** 

**Time: 1:11:58** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Training** 

Really ramped up training since October/November last year after getting a coach/joining a training group. Consistently been hitting 70-85km weeks with 2x sessions per week and Sunday long run of 20-26km.

Came off of a really strong/my first track season, where I managed a 15.30 5km and 8.53 3km on the track, so was feeling confident going into the race. 

**Race**

Was lucky enough to have my coach pace me for the whole race. 

**km 0-5 -** The plan was to go out at 3.30/km pace, but first 5km average was closer to 3.24/km pace due to a net descent here. Settled in nicely to this pace and felt relaxed in a group of 5 runners.

**Km 5-10 -** Relatively flat section here made it easy to settle in. The group dropped to 4 runners, and we had 1 sole runner about 10-15sec ahead of us. 

**Km 10-15 -** The grind really began here with the first decent hill of the course - about a 3-4% gradient over \~300m. Came to the top of this really fatigued and kept slipping 5-10m behind the pack, but managed to grab back on every time. The pack dropped to 3 of us here and the race leader was a good 20seconds ahead

**KM 15-21:** Always a brutal 5-6km here. Kept things controlled until km 19, when I decided to try to drop the 3rd guy in our group. I put in a surge over 1km and put a good 30m on him before hitting the first of 3 hills that led to the finish line. The last 2km was a series of 3 rolling hills which forced the pace to drop down to 3.30s - 35s. With 1km to go we (pacer and I) were closing in on first place, but 15 seconds was just too much to make up. Crossed the line in second place in 1:11:58, barely standing but alive! 

**Thoughts:**

Way way quicker than I had planned! Having my coach pace was worth at least 1-2 minutes. I think he always planned for me to run well under sub 1.15, just didn't share that with me beforehand. The next challenge is putting in a similar performance without a pacer, as I think I really would have struggled mentally without one.

**Training**

**Marathon prep time?**

I learned of the cut-off date to qualify for Boston 2021 5 weeks ago, and apparently decided 'what the hell' and signed up for my first marathon on a whim. This led to 2 weeks of structured marathon training.

**Long run?**

I had been running 13mi long runs before “committing” (I use this term rather loosely) to marathon prep long runs. I then increased my long run to 14.5mi for the first week of marathon training and then to 16.5mi for the second week of marathon training. No sacred 20mi training run for me.

**Nutrition?**

I practiced using chewable gummies during the 16.5mi run and did not like them (made me feel super dehydrated). After that, I tried Gatorade endurance gels and liked them a lot because they were much less viscous, and I didn’t feel the need to take water while ingesting them. I practiced using these gels on no more than 1 run before deciding that they would be my fuel of choice for the marathon.

**Marathon-paced workouts?**

During my 14.5mi run, I threw in 4.5mi of marathon pace effort.

The next week, I attempted to do a workout where I was to run 6mi at marathon pace (alternating x2mi at MP, x1mi off), but couldn’t maintain the MP after the first 2mi set and scrapped the workout.

**Injury?**

I had initially planned to do 3 weeks of structured marathon training with a 2wk taper, but started to experience some minor but noticeable L knee pain towards the end of my 2nd week of training, so I ended up using the elliptical for an hour (x3-4/per week) for the following two weeks and limited myself to running x2-3 times per week during this time period in the hopes that the discomfort would resolve itself.

**Mileage?**

41.3mi, 42.6mi, (knee pain started) 29.1mi, 16.9mi, 17.3mi. Prior to this though, I had been running in the mid-40mpw range for the past 3mo.

**Day before race**

I actually live on the west coast, but I found a cheap flight to Chicago ($160ish round trip). So I flew out the afternoon before and arrived at O’Hare around 7:30pm.

I then got a rental car and ate dinner at a Denny’s. I was in such a rush to prep for the trip and catch my flight in time that I hadn’t ate anything except the snacks the airline gives you during the flight, so those Denny’s pancakes tasted extra good.

Stopped at a Target to pick up some gloves as well as an energy drink and a large blueberry muffin to eat the morning of. Then drove to my Airbnb and arrived at 10:30pm. Got settled in a little bit and went to sleep around 11:30pm.

**Race day**

I woke up around 4:30am which was a bit hard for me since it was 2:30am pacific time (the fact that I usually go to sleep around 1-2am didn’t help with that time zone transition lol).

I ate my muffin, couldn’t stomach the energy drink (it tasted horrible) and threw on my clothes plus some extra layers.

I am notoriously bad for arriving to the races horribly late (I.e. my “warm up” for races sometimes involves running to the starting line before the guns goes off), so I was pleasantly surprised to find I was one of the earlier runners to make it to the course that morning. It helped that my Airbnb was a mere 8min away from the race course.

I killed some time before the race just sitting in my rental car and playing Candy Crush Saga (such an exhilarating race report write-up so far, I know. Don’t worry, things get more eventful).

The race groups runners into waves by their BQ time. So I was in the ‘3:30 marathon’ group. We were part of the smaller group of Sunday marathon runners and were a real small bunch (maybe like 30-40 of us?). I enjoyed getting to hear some of the backstories of the other runners and what part of the U.S. they were from. Someone in our group has run Boston 28 years in a row!

**Race**

We took off promptly at 6:50am. This marathon course is run in 8-ish loops. The first loop is an extended 4.5mi loop and the rest of the loops are roughly 3mi. I definitely wanted to stick with some more talkative runners and just chat/cruise through the first miles of this race. I ended up making some “marathon friends” (is that a thing?) and may have even annoyed them a little bit by being overly-talkative (if somehow any of you are reading this, I am sorry lol).

My nutrition goal was to take one Gatorade gel (80kcal each) 40 minutes into the race (and then alternate between taking x1 and x2 every 40min thereafter) and supplement with Gatorade.

**Splits**

**Splits through the first 10mi:**

1: 7:33/mi

2: 7:34/mi

3: 7:33/mi

4: 7:40/mi

5: 7:33/mi

6: 7:31/mi

7: 7:40/mi

8: 7:28/mi

9: 7:34/mi

10: 7:37/mi

And then I **bonked. HARD.**

Haha JK NO! \*not yet at least..

I wish I could share some humorous/enlightening/oh-so-relatable marathon experiences that I had during this time but things were very uneventful. Breathing was very relaxed, although I was concerned that I was going too fast (I was aiming for 7:40ish pace).

**Splits from miles 11-21:**

11: 7:32/mi

12: 7:33/mi

13: 7:44/mi

14: 7:33/mi

15: 7:38/mi

16: 7:41/mi

17: 7:40/mi

18: 7:38/mi

19: 7:42/mi

20: 7:45/mi

21: 7:43/mi

Around 10-12ish miles into the race, I realized I was getting some minor abdominal pain about 5-10min after I consumed my Gatorade gel. I had planned to consume x2 gels around the 80min and 2hr mark but decided to go with just one instead because I feared consuming two might increase the severity of my pain. I decided rely more on the Gatorade since it didn’t seem to be bothering my stomach.

Towards mile 19 things started to get interesting…I suddenly started to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. The first time it hit me, it was a minor urge that I didn’t even think twice about, but that urge continued to resurface every half a mile thereafter and increased in intensity. Ruh-roh…

**split for mile 22** (yes, it deserves its own singulatory time column)

8:03/mi

This was the turning point of the race and where things went sour. And not in the hitting the wall due to muscular/cardiovascular fatigue type of way that I had initially anticipated. The urge to go had become too much and after 2-3mi of trying to run through it, I accepted that I would have to stop at a porta-potty along the course and lose some time along the way. Okay, fine, no big deal.

So I was jogging along about a 100m away from the porta-potty and all of a sudden I was faced with the visceral realization that I wasn’t going to make it in time. “Dear god, why??” I thought in anguish as a cold sweat broke out on me for the first time during the race. I made a desperate/mad yet awkwardly galloping rush into the claustrophobia-inducing cramped space to take care of things, then gingerly trotted back onto the course. By the time I re-emerged to the pavement, the guy I had been keeping pace with was long gone.

Unfortunately, after my GI system decided to revolt on me, I was still left with some lingering abdominal pain that made it unattainable to stick to the 7:40ish ‘groove’ I had going on earlier during the previous 22mi.

At this time, I realized my Abd discomfort wasn’t going to get better, so the best I could do at this point is hang on for the ride. I stopped looking at my mile splits after mile 23.

**splits for miles 23-26.5:**

23: 8:06/mi

24: 8:05/mi

25: 8:12/mi

26: 8:21/mi (ugh)

0.5mi: 7:48/mi

**Official** **time:** 3:24:28

**Post-race:**

My biggest personal regret is that I didn’t push harder the last 2 miles of the race. Sure, I was hurting, but I never had a 'see Jesus' moment and could have pushed a little bit more without redlining to maintain a 8:05mi/pace. After seeing 2 consecutive miles click away 20 seconds off pace at 8:03 and 8:06, I felt demoralized a bit and just told myself the new goal was to finish and to not worry about time. In hindsight, I think I gave up too easily.

I guess it’s been about 36hrs post marathon now, but I really haven’t had an appetite since (I choked down some carbs -mostly bread- throughout the rest of the day yesterday and today, but it hasn’t been much) and my GI system seems to still be having a little bit of issues processing food. I'm not too concerned about it though. Between this race and school, I've had a lot of stress in my life which typically dampens my appetite. My arms and L hip were sore immediately after the race, but I woke up with no soreness this morning.

I really wished I could have explored Chicago more and indulged in some of its iconic food (I’m looking at you, deep dish pizza), but I had to catch a flight a few hours later and finish up cramming for my cardiology exam that was this morning for my doctoral program. Only got 4hrs of sleep last night since I had to wake up at 4am to continue studying :’( so please excuse any typos I may have made on this write-up; my mental gas tank is on empty at the moment!

Interestingly enough, according to my Garmin watch data, my average HR during this race was quite high at 186 (with a solid 20min stretch where my HR was at 196) and maxed at 207. My heart rate tends to be on the high side, but I didn’t know I could maintain such a high HR throughout the race. You would think I would be feeling like straight death at those HR but apparently not. Clearly, my HR zones aren’t too accurate because there’s no way I could truly be running in zone 5 for 2hrs and 47minutes like Garmin tells me I did.

**Concluding thoughts:**

So, I know this is 100% me being petty, but I am kind of disappointed the race was a solid 0.3 miles long. If it was 26.3, I wouldn’t be complaining, but almost a third of a mile extra isn’t negligible for people like myself who were on the ‘bubble’ for BQ times (I spoke to at least 6 other people who also had their GPS at 26.45-26.55 as well as one of the race organizers who said that this race typically ends up being a ‘long course’).

Based on my Garmin, I came through 26.2 two minutes faster at 3:22:32. I just hope this doesn’t end up making the difference between me qualifying or not.

I figure with only a -5:32 BQ time, qualifying for 2021 won’t be in the cards for me.

Going into this race, I had no idea what my fitness was. The last time I raced a half marathon was in March 2020 (I finished with a 1:38). I ran a 10k the weekend before to gauge my fitness, but 4 out of the 6.2 miles ended up being on sand so my race results weren’t super useful.

I predicted the chance of me actually hitting my rather arbitrary ‘A’ goal time of BQ -9 based on the solid amount of marathon training I put into the race (see: 2 weeks) was close to 1-2%.

I guesstimated I had a 50/50 shot of going under 3:30. And I honestly wouldn’t have been surprised if I had to drop out of the race soon after I hit the half marathon distance.

So that said, I am fairly, although not totally, satisfied with the way things panned out. I feel like I could have gotten my official time under 3:24 if I tried harder to maintain a 8 flat pace toward the end.

I don’t really think I enjoy the marathon distance. I would like to run Boston, NYC, and Chicago sometime in my life, but it’s pretty far down on my list of running goals I have at the moment. There’s definitely some nice camaraderie among a lot of the runners, but I think I prefer the 10k/half marathon distances more.

Marathon training just takes too much effort for my liking (not that I really know what actual dedicated training is like for a marathon anyway LOL..)",1618893569
AdvancedRunning,RyanSierra225,Goal setting for a 5k program (Relative beginner/intermediate),"Hey everyone, hope this finds you well. I also hope this is okay to post here since I'm aiming to be as advanced and as competitive as I can.

Basically, im aiming to improve my 5k substantially in a relatively short period of time. I realise this can be seen as stupid and I would agree. However I've got to meet a few standards for a military thing and I want to achieve the best results I can.

My current 5k is 27:00. And I want to get it sub 24 relatively soon. But what would be a good way to approach it?

About me, Im 5'11 and I weigh 99kg. Im doing 4-5 gym sessions a week. And I've picked a 5k level 2 program (From Matt Fitzgeralds 80/20 book) that has me doing 6-7 days a week.

What should I be thinking? What would be a reasonable expecting? Is a 1min improvement fair? Can I make that into a 2 min improvement?

Any advice would be grateful. Even if you disagree with what im trying to do.

### Training
So last year I trained twice for my first full marathon using Pfizer 18/55 only for it to be understandably cancelled. I kept my miles ticking over at roughly 40 per week with no real aim, but decided in January that I’d love to feel some of the fitness I had when I was marathon training. I also thought it would be good to build some mileage or have some structure before I start my marathon training again in May so looked at local HMs and plotted 12 weeks out of training in my calendar. 

I mainly followed Pfitz 18/55 again, but cut the medium long runs down to a max of 14-16km in the week. I kept the Sunday runs the same, including 1 20 miler and a 26km with 16km hm pace. I also did a 16k with 10km at hm pace a week before the half. 
I averaged between 45-50 miles per week over 12 weeks. 

### Pre-race
Nothing exciting, went to the pub for a meal the day before but drank zero alcohol beers. Ate a halloumi fries sandwich and went to bed early. 
Had pancakes with golden syrup and a flat white when I got up and 4 glasses of water at about 7am. 

### Race
Race started at 9;30 and I was in the third wave, went out too fast and felt great. My watch was set to a pace of 1 minute for a pb and constantly beeped telling me to slow down. 
I went through 5k in 18:40 which was my second fastest. I went through 10km in 38:01 which is my fastest. 

I started next to a guy in Dennis the Menace fancy dress and he went off like a rocket. I saw him in the distance at about the 15k mark and decided I would try and catch him. 
Went past him at 16km and saw another guy that blitzed by me at about the 6k mark and was still feeling great so decided to make him my next target. 
I took him with 2k to go and realised that those kms were probably some of my fastest and decided to see if I could keep pushing the pace. 

My watch ended at 1:20:xx but my distance shows 21.3km and I’m thinking that tree coverage threw off my gps so it appears long. Went through the line at 1:21:35 feeling fantastic setting a surprising almost 2 minutes on. 

### Post-race
Went home, had some avocado and eggs on toast and celebrated with an alcoholic beer. 

My plan is to go Sub 3 in September in my first marathon with the hope of qualifying for London next year. I’ve got 5.5 months of training to go and this race has given me some confidence for sure.

**For reference:** 

* 15 years old HS sophomore
* Top runners who are likely to race 9:47- 4 or 5 10:20's
* Past 10 weeks MPW: 20-20-20-30-40-30-40-50-45-50
* PR's 17:03 5K XC on my own (2020 relatively hilly course)- 4:53 1600m (2019 Indoor) - 12:10 (2018 outdoor \*last recorded 3200 race bc of covid, back when I heel struck)

**Advice:**

* **Advice for sharpening**, I'm thinking Rojer Bannister style 4x800m with small jog + a few  mileage days + a tempo run this week. How should I structure the week leading up? 
* **Advice for tactics?** I will likely timewise be in between those 2 groups, the fast dude, and the chase back of 10:20's
* **Advice for how a race like this will shape out?** like I said, haven't raced this distance for a long time",1618844319

It seemed to be well received so thought I would post another one. 

A few disclaimers:

* **I'm trying to keep things fresh.** At one point in my life, the ability to train everyday was a no brainer. With current career and life responsibilities, training consistency is tough. I welcome anything to keep up engagement with open arms. 
* **Training philosophy can't be determined from one workout.** Yes, It's good to understand that training philosophy is developed over an entire training cycle. But, it's fun to compare and contrast what different professional/collegiate teams are doing for individual workouts at different parts of the season

# Suffering with Tinman Elite at Gold's Hill

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPb\_u3hSva4**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPb_u3hSva4)

**Who**: Tinman Elite. A training team based out of Boulder, Colorado that are aiming to qualify for the 2021 Olympics

**What:** ""Gold's Hill"" A hill workout at elevation about 15 miles outside of Boulder. The end of the video reveals it turned out to be 13.1 miles of work for the day. 

**When:** Really early in the quarantine period \~April 2020. At this point, it seems like the team knew that their racing schedule was out the door and a base training period would be occurring for the foreseeable future. 

**Some insight from the professional team:**

* **""**At Gold Hill, you are questioning if this is a place you can run because of how long the hills are.""
*  *“We have been cooped up for a long time...it’s so rare that we get a time to hurt to feel productive so that’s what we are doing tomorrow.” - Drew Hunter* 🧱🧱🧱

*This video provided some brick wall material. When I say ""brick wall material"", I mean the stuff that makes you feel like you can run through a brick wall.* 

* It seemed like the entire team was apprehensive about this workout because it was going to hurt so much.

**How to implement:**

* There wasn't a clear consensus regarding the length of the hill repeats that they were doing. But I did a little Strava stalking and the segments in this Gold Hill area look painful. Most of the leader boards for the segments showed a relatively slow pace at the top of the leaderboard (&gt;7:30 per mile for the segments). 
* From what I gathered, my personal opinion would be that **long, grinding 400 meter hills (would love to hear other opinions about this) would be equivalent to the workout Tinman performed.**
* Early in this training phase, that's exactly what I did. 5 by 400 m hills with jog down recovery. As expected they hurt. If you put any stock into Whoop recovery data, my ""recovery"" level was the lowest I had seen it in months (19%). Subjectively, my legs felt like bricks for a few days after.  
   * (*Side note: If there are any Washington DC area runners in the group, I can give you some insight to the hill I found that I think is appropriate for this workout. PM me.)*
* **My Big takeaway:** If you haven't touched anaerobic stuff for awhile, be aware of your recovery after the workout. 

Happy week of training everyone.",1618837889

AdvancedRunning,takenoko91,"How do you Find a Decent ""Running"" Doctor?","Hello r/AdvancedRunning,

I'm dealing with what I suspect to be a running related injury. I know I need to go to a sports medicine doctor or physiotherapist for proper diagnosis and treatment. The first recommendation of the internet when runners assert they have potential injuries seems to be ""find a medical professional who is also a runner or works heavily with runners."" I heartily agree with this statement based off a previous experience several years ago. I had a terrible misdiagnosis from a sports medicine doc who didn't work much with women or runners which resulted in a significantly worse injury several years ago.

The problem I'm now encountering is how do I sort through such a 
large field of medical practioners? Do I hit up the standard sport and spine clinic in hopes of a good match? Do I call up GP medical offices and ask which of their docs run? Do I call a running speciality store and ask for potential recommendations? Is there some kind of organization which certifies doctors that focus on runners? There has to be a more efficient way to find a great (or at least decent) doctor for diagnosing and treating running injuries. 

TLDR: How do you find a sports medicine doctor or physiotherapist who is also a runner (or at least understands runners)? I'm grateful for any tips and tricks that anyone can offer. Thank you!",1618797275

### Training

Had one prior outdoor race in mid-March. Weekly, I do 2 workouts and a long run, averaging mid 50s-low 60s for mileage over 6 days per week. Workouts consisted of lots of threshold and CV training in Feb/March but been lots of 200s/300s/400s at 1500m pace with generous jog rest since the start of April. The race in March was a 4:09 1500m that went disastrously. It wasn't physical at all, and I tucked in quickly, but struggled to even keep that slow pace and was out of it mentally. That was my first real race since a 26-flat XC 8k in October. After the bad 1500m, I slowed down workouts (at my coach's discretion) and easy runs (at my own discretion). I believe this has helped a lot. The workouts are at a slower pace than running calcs say my paces should be, but I think certain factors like stress from school mean I'm not always working out in optimal conditions.

### Pre-race

Had done some fast 300s on Tuesday that felt smooth, as well as 3x200 strides the day before. Unfortunately, I got bad sleep both Monday night and Wednesday night. Had a big exam Thursday and was pissed I couldn't get good sleep 2 nights before, since it's said that's the most important night for sleep. Still, I didn't sweat it since the race was Friday at 8PM, and I let myself sleep 9 hours and change Thursday night before a 1.5 mile shakeout with a few light drills at noon on race day. My 1500m PR is 4:01.9 from two years ago, but I knew I wouldn't quite be in that shape, so decided to shoot for 65s.

### Race

Gun went off and people went out quick. I think everyone (including me) was excited by how fast the prior heats had gone. I knew I didn't need to waste energy staying at the front of a start that fast, though, so I comfortably tucked into what turned out to be last place. Was a bit surprised to see 63 point at the 400 but wasn't happy or mad about it. Moved by a few runners after the first 400.

Right at 700m / 2 laps to go, a kid I'd passed made an aggressive move and cut me off, clipping my stride. I had been surprisingly calm until then, but I lost my cool here, shoving him and yelling something like ""give me some fucking room"". I immediately regretted this, realizing it was a waste of energy that would likely cut into my finishing speed. Saw 2:09 at 800m and was happy to see it. 

I can't really start my kick on a dime, so I decided to wind up with 600m to go. I passed one or two more people right at 1000m coming off the curve. I remember being surprised that I felt good enough to pass this late in the race (my confidence had taken a hit after my season opener). Sadly there was a big gap between the runners I had passed and the rest of the race, so I felt like I was in no-man's land for a few seconds. With 400 to go, I saw the clock was sub-3. I knew I wouldn't run sub-4 but figured I could run 4:02 or 4:03 if I kicked hard.

With somewhere around 300 to go, my form started breaking down. I felt my arm drive get weaker, and knee lift slowly turned to kicking my foot further back than usual. 2 people passed me with 200 to go, and I was pissed that I was letting my teammates and friends who were watching down. With 75m to go, I shit-kicked one last guy before finishing. As I crossed the finish, I realized that I only shit-kicked because someone was there, and if I had more mental fortitude, I may have been able to turn that into a more effective drive from 200m out rather than 75m.

### Post-race

Chatted with my coaches, and they were happy that I didn't completely fall apart like in the first race. I think we were both disappointed in my finish, though. Our team overall ran great, with tons of PRs that make me more confident than ever in my coaches and program. This was my second fastest 1500m ever, and I'm now left wondering if I could take a shot at 4 flat soon. My last in-uniform race will be May 1st, and I'm thinking with the start of my peak, better sleep, more race experience, and not shoving/yelling at someone mid-race, taking 5.4 seconds off isn't out of this world. I will definitely take a shot at my PR. Do you guys think that 2-second difference between shooting for that or 4 flat is too much?

I'm not putting a ton of pressure on myself going into it. Conference is mid-May, and though I'm not going, my coach encouraged me to run one or two time trials/races during this period since it's what we peak for as a team. However, it would be really awesome to break 4 while repping my team. Would love to hear thoughts about my prior and future race, and I'm happy to field any questions.

AdvancedRunning,SubstantialSherbet36,Achilles Problem [not a serious medical condition],"Hi, I'm a toe striker. I used to run through my injuries, but this Achilles injury is taking the fun out of running. I can walk endless miles with no issue, but the second I start to run, my heel gets serious discomfort and my Achilles has discomfort. It has been present for over a year, during which I took a 2 month break from running and it didn't heal-- rest does nothing it seems. I do eccentric heel drops nonstop and do strength training with zero-drop shoes to see if it makes a difference-- it doesn't. Moreover, I swap out my trainers twice a year. If I warm up for a mile or two, the pain goes away to some extent, but it's still present. There is some discomfort when I grab my Achilles by the tendon. I suspect toe striking has something to do with it because I was a heel striker up until about a year ago. Unfortunately, I tried to go back to heel striking, but the pain doesn't dissipate. I want to get back to competing so badly.

AdvancedRunning,CTwoThree,Pfitz: Recommended Paces vs. HR Ranges,"***Main Question: What should you pay more attention to, Pfitz's recommended workout paces or HR ranges? Which should take priority in terms of training effect, injury prevention etc.?***

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*Background: 25M, 45km/week (26mi) building back to previous peak of 65+km/week (40mi) after relatively minor ankle injury cut my mileage for ~4weeks. All clear from physio. Using Pfitz's Base Building guide in Faster Road Racing (all easy miles so far with some strides) with the intention of doing a Pfitz 5k plan soon(ish).*

&amp;nbsp;

Pfitz's Faster Road Racing has two methods of calculating paces: Recommended paces based off PBs/PRs, and Heart Rate Ranges based off HRR. 

**Based off my 5k time of ~21mins Pfitz would recommend my long run (Endurance) pace to be 5:15-5:49min/km (8:26-9:21min/mi).**

**Based off his ranges for HRR my HR Range would be 143-162bpm.** These don't seem to match for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

e.g Today's ""long"" ""endurance"" run was: **14km** @ avg. **154bpm** (using Polar H10 chest strap) @ avg. pace of **4:52min/km** (7:50min/mi). 

This was a fairly comfortable pace, I could have held a decent conversation, I wasn't really out of breath at the end, and I could have kept running. Obviously this is comfortably within range for BPM but quite a bit faster than the recommended paces. 

&amp;nbsp;

For faster workout paces my HR and recommended paces tend to match (tempo/intervals etc.) so this mismatch only occurs on slower runs, I think this is because my cardio fitness is better than my legs as I have only been running for 1 year. 

I am tempted to find a middle ground and try and slow to around 5:10min/km (which would be the bottom of the HR range Pfitz recommends and probably stay &lt;150bpm for the whole run) but I would be interested to hear if others have had this issue, and if slowing would diminish the training effect.",1618748599

\### Training

So some background: I am a 23 year old male, a year out of college. In high school, I was fairly decent, starting off running \~5:38 in a mile my freshman year to running 9:32 in a full 2 mile by my senior year. However, I couldn't sustain my improvements in college. I consistently was injured, having an avulsion fracture in my left hip that never fully healed as well as a few shin stress fractures. That, combined with mental health issues, led me to nearly quit the XC team many times. I did have a few decent races, running 25:39 my junior year in an 8k, but that was really about it.  


Once I graduated college, COVID was very much a thing, so I couldn't compete, run with people, and it was hard getting myself to get running again. I started off exploring some local trails, and I fell in love with relaxing in nature and finding new trails to run. I steadily worked my way to 70 miles a week, adding in short workouts here and there to keep it interesting. Through the summer, I was fairly disorganized about workouts. I'd do two-ish a week, but I never really planned them out. It would usually be a tempo effort within a long run (8-12 miles at marathon pace, longer warmup and cooldown) and then a shorter speed workout (repeat 1000s at 5k or 10k pace, fartleks, etc). I decided to try out a 10k time trial a couple months in for the heck of it and I ran a 32:33, which isn't amazing, but for the first 10k I've ever ran, it was solid (and negative split! 16:23/16:10). Around here is when I decided, heck, maybe I should train for a marathon!  


Surprise, got myself injured again (shins, again) around mid-October and couldn't really run until mid-December. I was determined to keep myself in shape, so I biked a decent amount and did a little bit of weight training. I eased into mileage once I could run again, and after about a month of running, I decided to try the BAA level 4 training plan (although I modified it for a peak of 70-75 miles a week; I felt that a 20 mile long run at the 50-60 that they wanted was a bit overkill.) I also modified the workouts a bit -- if my hip or shin was feeling iffy, I'd skip the workout or move it to a different day if possible. I'd also skip workouts if the % of hard miles (marathon pace or faster) was over 20%. I'd try to get most of my easy runs on trails/grass, although when I started my runs after 7:30 PM, it was difficult to run somewhere where I could see that had grass/dirt. Thank the lord for Commonwealth Avenue which has a median with a ""trail"" built into it.  


Few key workouts:  
18 miles; 3 mile warmup, 12 miles at 5:46 pace (a bit faster than I intended), 3 mile cooldown  
20 miles; 10 mi warmup, 10 miles at 5:38 pace  
12 miles; 3 mile warmup, 6 miles at 5:24 pace, 3 mile cooldown  
5k TT @ 15:10

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Ran \~40 miles the week before my TT, with 3 miniworkouts, each just training my legs to run at 10k pace, HM pace, and marathon pace. Nothing long at all. The Saturday prior to the race, I recruited a friend to try to pace me on his bike, and I went 6.5 miles at around 5:54 pace. Tried to figure out what worked and what didn't in terms of pacing and what not.  


Week of the TT, ran max 4 miles in a day, gave myself plenty of time to relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Conditions: Well it snowed the day before, so I was worried I would have to cancel the TT. Luckily the rain washed away the snow. It was \~40F and raining with a 34 degree windchill. Not terrible but I wished it was drier.  


Loaded some emergency supplies onto my friends' bike along with some water and gels. We started around 9:30 AM and made our way down to the rail trail. Felt extremely comfortable, until around mile 11 when I had an awful side stitch. It wasn't affecting my speed, as my legs felt great, but it was extremely annoying. I caved in at mile 13 and drank a swig of water and that got rid of the side stitch, somehow. Was still talking with my friend at this point, and honestly was able to speak in sentences till about mile 18. Started to get harder here, but still wasn't too bad. Around mile 20 or so, I feel a massive pull in my right calf. I tried to ignore it as much as possible, but that combined with the inevitable wall had me falling well off pace on mile 22-26, progressively getting slower. I was so close to sub 2:35! Oh well.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Tried to walk back to my car after the race. My calves were in insane pain. I definitely mildly tore my calf, but I'm honestly OK with it. Going to take a few weeks off at the minimum and then get back into actual trail running!  
Although I practically fell off a cliff, it had less to do with my training and more to do with an injury partway through. Fairly happy with my first attempt at a marathon, and hopefully I can enter a real one at some point! I'm still in a lot of pain and lying in bed as I type this.",1618696178

So I’m doing the 12/47 pfitzinger half marathon plan, and during the peak week I managed to wake up an old Achilles injury, and missed two of the runs so far (the mid week long run and the speed work day).

My question is this - should I just jump back in the training plan, ignoring the days I’ve missed, or should I call an audible and re-do peak week, replacing the 2nd “practice race” week? I’m someone who gains a lot of confidence in going on the longer runs, but I also read over and over again if you miss runs just jump back in, don’t try and call audibles.

What do you guys think? Is the peak week important enough to fit back in or should I just shrug my shoulders and keep going, knowing the race is just a few weeks away.",1618683833
