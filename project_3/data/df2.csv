### Training

This is the first marathon I had ever run. The brief background of my running experience is I ran two seasons of XC and one season of track in high school to satisfy PE credits and get out of taking a PE class. I was moderately fast but didn't try very hard. Notable PRs were 5:11 or so for the mile and 2:10 or so for the half mile, and maybe a few high-18 5ks. 

I had not run consistently for at least 7 years or so, and in 2020 I was starting to get tired of being lazy and unfit, so I started running again. After injuring my knee, I picked up cycling for about 6 months. 

In late 2020 I made some new friends, one of which who ran casually and had run a marathon before. One day they were going out for an 11 mile easy run and I was bored so I asked them how fast they were running and if I could accompany them. The 11 mile run ended up being super fun and not as hard as I thought it would be. I then ran a virtual half-M with them with the goal of simply finishing it, and finishing it under 2 hours if I could - which I did. This was late 2020, and both inspired and solidified my desire to run a marathon.

So in february 2021, I signed up for the SF marathon and started to ""seriously"" train.

From the outset, I was aware that I wanted this to be a fun process, and knowing my own personality, I did not want to lock myself into a strict training plan and stop enjoying the running - so I didn't. My original goal was to simply finish the marathon in under 4 hours and enjoy the process. 

I continued to split my volume about evenly between cycling and running. I started getting much faster at running, and at some point I decided I wanted to actually race the marathon and do the best I could. I did not really have a goal in mind except to actually apply myself to the race. 

I started adding volume and very loosely following a Pfitz plan, but pretty much sticking to the rate of volume increase and skipping some of the workouts. 

In late March/early April, there was a period of time where the single workout I did every Saturday was a long fast run, pretty much a tempo run I guess, and for 3-4 Saturdays in a row I got faster and faster, eventually PRing my half marathon at about 1:32 or so. This was at a peak of about 50-60 MPW, I think I hit over 60MPW exactly one week this year


This was incredibly enticing and I decided my new goal was to run a 3 hour marathon. The marathon was originally scheduled for July at this time. 

However, not sticking religiously to a plan and not really knowing how to train myself effectively, I overtrained *several* different times. Shortly after that 1:32 half-M I experienced a minor knee injury that put me out for a week. I returned and tried to bump up the volume again, but a repetitive cycle of overtraining, collective fatigue, and minor injuries persisted throughout the summer and limited my volume. I don't think I hit over 50MPW again more than 2 or 3 times. 

The marathon also got postponed to September, which *really* killed my enthusiasm for a couple weeks. I had to extend my training another 8 weeks? I was going to miss the entire peak cycling season instead of just half of it? I was super bummed.

But I kept going. Nothing much interesting happened in the period between late May and September  except for that cycle of overtraining - which I eventually corrected for by just not running as much, usually mid 30s or 40s MPW. Sometimes zero miles, a couple weeks of all cycling, etc. 

I also contracted COVID (im vaccinated) in late August, about 4 weeks before the race. That put me out for yet another week, and I had 3 weeks to prepare for the race afterwards. I decide to say fuck it to a taper or easy period or whatever, and I ramped up *heavily* to basically try to make race day a sort of peak in a training plan. 

I was feeling nervous with 1 week to go. The Friday 9 days out from the race, I tried a workout I had seen on this sub: 20 miles with the first 10 miles easy and the second 10miles at marathon pace. after running 10 miles at mid-8 pace, I accelerated to sub-7 pace. This was *extremely* difficult, and I was only able to hold the pace for about 4-5 miles before completely blowing up and limping the last 5 miles home at a *weak* feeling high-8 or low-9 pace, with lots of walking and breaks. I only hit 19 miles, not the goal of 20. 

I was incredibly nervous after this and adjusted my goal to a 3:15 finish time and convinced myself I would be happy with it. I spent my last week relaxing - I did 2 easy 9 mile runs early in the week, 3 total rest days, and a *super* easy 4 mile run the day before the race



### Pre-race

The evening before, I carb loaded. I avoided any protein after lunch the day before as I knew that would lead to harder-to-plan bowel movements. I carb loaded by eating a bagel and a banana and drinking a Gatorade. Then I woke up at 3:30am, took a hot shower, ate a second bagel, and rode my bike to the race (3 miles across the city). Super happy they had a bike check. The bike served as a decent warm up. 

I ate a banana, did a quick .7 mile warm up but then I realized I was ""late"" to my wave and jetted over for the final bowel movement and then the start line. ""late"" because the race stated you could start in a later wave without needing to ask. 

### Race

When originally registering, I gave a ""planned"" finish time of 3:45. So that is about the speed of all the people I started with, combined with the fact that I was also slightly late, so everyone starting with me was running somewhere between. 3:30 to 4 hour race. 

My goal at this point was 3:15, but I started out WAY too fast owing to the excitement and adrenaline and the caffeinated Nuun I dropped in my pre-race Gatorade. I was running a high-6 or low-7 mile for the first 3-4 miles, weaving in and out of slower runners. I even heard two people comment as I ran by something like ""that guy went out way too fast"". 

But that's OK. I continued to feel absolutely *amazing*. the weather was perfect, I have always had a bit of competitiveness when training (disliking being passed on the bike and while running) and so passing people felt really good and splitting around people was actually kind of fun and distracting in a positive way. 

Coming across the Golden Gate Bridge back into the city, I hit the first half - just about 1:30 dead on. I felt *great* and the entire first half of the race I was envisioning my ""kick"" across the finish line (just like the old XC days) and mentally preparing to negative split the second half. I even called my mom, mid race on my AirPods, to tell her I was coming in faster than I expected. 

The next 5-6 miles felt *alright*. The amazing feeling declined, so slowly such that I did not really notice until around 15 or 16 that I had stopped feeling amazing and was no longer as mentally ""present"". This is what happens when I start running out of gas. I realized what was happening and decided to slow down to a low-to-mid 7 pace to recover as best I could, hoping that my kick the last mile or two could pull me out of that time debt. 

It wasn't to be. At mile 20 or so I pretty much blew up. Not completely, but the last 6 miles were torture, absolute torture. Around mile 21, I felt my right leg sort of spasm and pain go through my calf and hamstring - I was briefly terrified at having to DNF, but I quickly slowed down and the next few steps were OK. However, anytime I pushed the effort, my right leg would spasm again, and I knew I was one bad stride away from completely pulling or tearing something and a moderate to major injury, so I had to baby my stride and right leg the last 5 miles. 

I continued to slow down, running high 7s or low- to mid-8s the rest of the race. Besides my leg, I was also ragged and totally out of energy. My form collapsed. 

With about one mile to go, I summoned some mental fortitude and told myself, fuck it you're going to kick anyway. So I kicked. I accelerated to the maximum pace I was able to sustain, something like 7:10. My form was terrible, I think I looked like a frantic zombie

Less than a quarter mile into this effort, my right leg told me nope, if you want a functional leg for the next month, you cannot physically do this, sorry. So I slowed down again. 


### Post-race

I nearly limped across the finish line. I was super disappointed with how I ran the last 6, but with a final time of 3:07:40, I was both extremely pleased and a little surprised that I held on to such a good time despite the tortuous last 6 miles. 


Thoughts: 

I came in the top 60 out of almost 3200 people. That was thrilling but truly surprising. I can only guess at two factors: either SF is just not a popular or competitive marathon, despite being in a major famous city, or that COVID and this race being one of the first to run ""post""-COVID means that attendance was low. I am simply surprised that I came in the top 2% and yet did not even qualify for Boston. Maybe I have incorrect impressions about how many people actually qualify for boston, not sure. 

This was a super hilly course. I don't think a flat course is a magic bullet that would take 10 minutes off my time and get me under 3, but I do think it would be worth at least a few minutes. 

Seemingly a LOT of runners don't know how to use downhills to their advantage. I passed so many people on the downhills by opening my stride and picking up my cadence. At the same time, I was only able to take advantage of the downhills for the first 15 miles or so, after that I became too tired to safely and effectively increase my pace down the hills. They still saved me energy, but it wasn't the same. Especially at mile 20-21, there was a couple big downhills that I could not take advantage of due to my right leg and exhaustion. 

I did pleasantly surprise myself and push up the hills strategically and effectively by keeping my perceived exertion about the same, letting up on my pace for the 1-2 miles before large hills (I am intimately familiar with the course having spent a lot of time running major sections), and using the mile or two after hills (or the downhills) to recover and slowly bring my pace back up. 

For the last few months I knew that my inconsistent sort of YOLO training style would be my major limiting factor. I am now fairly confident that I know how to improve in the future and I am confident that if I ran another marathon in 6 months, I would be able to hit sub-3, even the same course. Besides a lack of general consistency, volume and long runs were major holes in my training. The longest runs I regularly ran were 15 or 16 miles runs with some marathon pace sprinkled throughout. I ran more than 16 miles maybe one or two times, with one of them being that awful 20 mile indicator run 9 days before the race. If I can successfully, and more slowly, increase my volume and incorporate more long runs, I think I can hit a sub-3. I also need to incorporate strength training into my routine somehow. 



When will my next marathon be? I don't honestly know. I know I am not done with them. I would love to sign up for the Big Sur marathon but I really want to get back to cycling and unfortunately I have unchangeable plans that weekend. 

I also know it won't be very soon. I have a loose desire to get into triathlons, so I need to see if/how that plays out. Maybe I will try a cycling race of some kind. With what I consider a year of ""serious"" endurance training under my belt (serious to me personally meaning I do it 5-6 days a week and its a big component of my life) I still feel very new and that there is a huge world of possibilities ahead of me. I enjoy being a fast runner, but when all I do is run, and without a near goal, it becomes unenjoyable and somewhat like a chore, so that is an issue I need to identify a solution to. Maybe more races, maybe different kinds of exercise, maybe I just need to summon motivation to take it up a notch.

3,AdvancedRunning,Nervous-Lobster1844,Modified Pfitz 18/55 taper,"I’m in the final weeks of training for the Chicago marathon where I’ve been following a modified version of Pfitz 18/55. What this primarily means is:

1. I usually run an easy 5-7 miles on the second rest day.
2. I’ve been doing an extra 2-4 hours of cross training most weeks as doubles (swimming and biking).

This means my peak weeks mileage wise are \~60, and hours wise \~10 hours of aerobic training (not necessarily the same weeks).

Now that I’m starting to taper and I've dropped the cross training, the mileage drop almost seems like too much. This is partially because I'm not used to running less than 6 days a week, so the second to last week with 3 rest days worries me. Should I continue to do easy runs on the rest days, or should I just follow the taper as stated and trust that an extra easy run or two won’t really be doing anything? 

Additional context: Most recent PR is a 1:26 half for the tuneup race 4 weeks out. Goal for Chicago is sub 3, but I have no expectations considering this will be my first marathon. Been running for 2 years, averaging an unstructured 35-60 mpw year round with a few 70 mile weeks thrown in. This cycle was my first extended period of structured running, and thus my first taper, so apologies if this is a dumb question.

Thanks for any insights!",1632350432

## Training

This was my second race of the year since covid had shut all my races down and then got a minor Achilles international tendinitis injury in my right heel. Originally at the beginning of the year i was going to try to get a few trail races in but because of the heel issue my coach, PT and i decided to just run flat easy equestrian trail and road runs with no workouts, hills or strides. No speed work for most of the year with just easy runs and occasionally skipping a long run while doing my PT. During this phase of running i would average 50-70 mpw with long runs around 2 hours that would usually be about 14-18 miles long. This base work went on until the end of July when heel pain finally got under control and we began to transition to marathon specific training.

Marathon training started at the beginning of August, my goal race is CIM and with the history of my heel injury we are being pretty cautious as far as workouts go. I do one workout a week unless its a recovery week after a race and a faster long run of 17-20 miles with 4x30 second strides 2 times a week. My weekly mileage jumps around a lot going from 50-90 mpw in order to still hit high mileage weeks but still have time to recover and make sure i don't find myself in a bad situation. My weekly mileage progression so far has been 70, 80, 90, 60 (10 mile tune up race), 70, 80 and 50 (the week of the SF half).

My running schedule for this week was pretty easy in preparation for the SF half. 

Monday i took off as i usually run 6 days a week.

Tuesday 16x400 at 80 seconds, 200 meters rest with strides and drills in the warm up, this workout was pretty easy and i felt really relaxed, almost felt like i could just keep running 400s all day. 

paces: 1:17, 1:20, 1:21, 1:20, 1:20, 1:20, 1:19, 1:19, 1:20, 1:20, 1:19, 1:20, 1:19, 1:18, 1:18, 1:18

Wednesday 10 miles easy.

Thursday 8 miles easy.

Friday 6 miles easy.

Saturday 5.8 miles easy mostly on dirt.

Sunday RACE!

## Pre-race

This is where things start to get a little interesting, the race directors changed the course on us and i don't think it was for the better. The SF marathon usually put on 2 half marathons, an early one that runs along the first half of the marathon course and a 2nd faster (as in competition) USATF certified one that runs along the 2nd half of the marathon course. This year the starting line was supposed to be at the Presidio which was perfect because my buddy who was running it also lived right around there, we would have been able to walk to the starting line. Well they combined the two races into one that starts at the Ferry Building on the other side of SF instead. 

The day before the race i drive to my buddy's, i live an hour away from the city so we were going to get dinner and then get to sleep so the morning of the race i wouldn't have to get up so early and drive that far. We are out at dinner in Japantown getting some good ramen, my pre-race secret is pho or ramen because it sits well and has plenty of sodium. All the sudden i realize, i had forgotten my bib sitting on my couch at home! I quickly email the race helpline to see if i could get a new bib in the morning but they didn't reply until early in the morning so i decided to just suck it up and drive back home and grab it, an extra 2 hours of driving the day before an important race i didn't need to do.

The morning of the race everything starts off well, conveniently woke up 10 minutes before my alarm went off so getting up was easy. I eat my instant oatmeal, maple and brown sugar flavor from Trader Joe's and then look at Uber rides to the Ferry Building and it was a whopping $50! We decide to drive instead, what a bad idea that was, no parking anywhere! We are running out of time and getting further and further from the starting line. Finally we find a spot, its about a mile from the start and we have 25 minutes until the start of the race, good thing i decided to get my bib yesterday, no time to get a new one now. 

With the time crunch we decide to take off our sweats and just run to the starting line for our warm up. We decided it would be better to save the time and not deal with the gear check since the weather was so nice anyway. We are a little frazzled and in the rush i forget my running hat in the car, that's fine i will run without it and deal with the sweat in my eyes. About 13 minutes later and a little over a mile we find the starting line and get ourselves situated, getting close to about 10 minutes to the start of the race now. 

I go up to where the start is and jump the divider to get up with the other top runners. I have time to settle in, get a few strides in and take my one GU before the race starts. A little unconventional but everything actually couldn't have worked out better. Even though i have a lot of anxiety i somehow don't stress about races, except this time because everything that could go wrong was going wrong, up until this point at least. I was finally able to relax and get into the zone for my race that was about to start.

## Race

I'm a few people back from the starting line and we all get ready for the start, they tell us to go, nothing spectacular, no gun, no annoying noise from a bull horn or any of that for this race i guess. My plan is to go the first mile at 6 to 5:50 pace and then settle in to a comfortable pace a little faster than that, the last race i ran i got pulled into running too fast with some guys that were trying to break 50 in 10 mile race. Didn't want to do that again. I manage to adjust my effort and my watch beeps 5:51, perfect! I start catching a lot of people that went out a little too hard that first mile that are trying to get into there correct pace, this is where i settle into low 5:40s. There was a group of about 5 runners maybe 50 to 25 meters in front of me for the next 4 miles and i was stuck in no mans land. I didn't want to push my pace this early in the race to catch up to them but i really wanted to be in their pack but i just kept my pace and didn't let them out of my sight, i had a feeling i would get my chance to catch them.

Coming up on mile 6 the pack of runners i had in my sights on for so long finally began to falter, as they started to string out as we came around a hair pin turn under the Golden gate bridge i started to pick them off one by one and it felt so good to power past them. I think this is why i ran so well this mile getting 5:37 despite the sharp hairpin turn we had. The first half of the race was nearly as flat as a pancake but the second part started off with one beast of a hill and i found myself at the foot of it feeling powerful. The remnants of the pack i had just caught, the lead woman with her lead bike entourage and two guys, were still in front of me and they were now in my domain. I have always been comparatively good at running up hills and the path we were on was packed cinder just like the equestrian trails i have been running all year. Looking at the grade adjusted paces i ran the equivalent of a 5:33 and it paid off because of the lead i had gotten on everyone.

The rest of the race was down hill from here, literally. We dropped elevation just as fast as we gained it. I eased back a little to regain some of the energy i had used to get my lead on the group, but still did not want them to catch me. After recovering a bit and protecting myself from the pounding of cruising down the hill it started to flatten out and i opened up my stride to take advantage of it managing to snag an easy 5:30 with just 4 more nearly flat miles left.

After spending the first half the race in no mans land with a group of runners just out of reach i now found myself in no mans land AGAIN with a strung out group i knew must have been hot on my heels. The next few miles were actually pretty nice and are the highlight of the race for me, it was nice and flat, i still felt good and was again cruising at 5:45 pace with the rest of the half marathon runners cheering me on as they were running the other direction because we were doubling back on the same route now. The sun was blinding me at this point too, sure could have used that hat i had forgotten. It seemed to work out fine though, because of squinting into the sun, i felt like i had the biggest shit eating grin on just like Eliud Kipchoge at the end of his races.

This is where the race started to get a little interesting in mile 11, they had us cut right through the slower runners to go straight up a little hill in a park. I nearly ran into an unsuspecting lady just cruising along for her race. This started to through me off from my grove i was in especially because i was starting to enter the end of race pain cave. To have the two of us nearly collide messing up our strides to then try and power up a small hill which mite as well have been Everest kind of messed me up and i tried to get back into the swing of things but was the beginning of my slowest miles in the race. The next mile was not that much better, it was poorly marked and because i was still in no mans land i couldn't just follow the leader, i had doubt at times of if i was going the right way and this was mile 12, another really important mile to usually just hunker down and push with out worrying if you were going off course or not. This mile was again tied for my slowest with the last one i had just ran. 

This last mile i was going to get back on track and run a fast finishing mile. At this point i had no doubts i was running the right course, i could tell because all of the last of the 5000 runners were all over the place and i was like a salmon swimming up stream to get through them. One of the runners even shoulder checked me but that wasn't going to stop me from getting to that finish line as i swerved and weaved through the horde at a 5:47 mile pace. What had happened was the runners were ignoring the cones in the middle of the road. I discovered the right hand side had less runners and ran there for a bit and then transitioned to the left again where i was originally supposed to be because it cleared out again. 

Time for the kick of eternity, just shy of a mile of perfectly straight road swerving through a crowd of confused runners. But i can see the clock, and i realize i'm not going to break 16, but HOLLY HELL! I'm about to PR by almost 3 minutes!!!

## Post-race

Finishing the race finally felt good and seeing my coach just after the finish line i walked up to him and we shared a bit about how the race went. This is when i header that some of the top finishers were lead the wrong way because the lead bike got lost. Could i have gotten lost too and this was why the course was so confusing the last few miles? My GPS said something like 13.14 miles but being this close to the city with the tall buildings it could be off. 

I hung out in the finishing coral a bit longer grabbing my medal, a photo and a bottle of water. By this time the group of runners that i had passed back at the hill started to finish. I saw the lead woman that i had passed on the hill and wanted to congratulate here for winning. This is when i learned about her lead bikers taking them down an interesting path as well. 

I meandered out of the coral and jumped over the divider again to get to where my coach was sooner and so i could watch the finish line. I had a few friends still in the race and wanted to watch them finish. My friend who also has the same coach was now finishing up and when she got to us told us about the messed up course also. She had about 13.47 miles on here GPS. 

Looking at the course map for the race it looks like i did run the right path and didn't cut it short but the race was poorly marked in the section going along the Aquatic park. I just got lucky that the people in front of me went the right way and i followed them. Everyone else was taken the wrong way by the lead bikers and ended up running nearly a third of a mile too far. This was a very frustrating finish to an otherwise amazing race, if i had more confidence in the course i could have pushed the end harder and easily broken 1:16 especially if it were not for fighting up a stream of other runners running the other direction and having that encounter with the guy who solder checked me. Everyone else that was lead the wrong way could have run 1-2 minutes faster depending on how much longer the course actually was for them.

All in all i am very happy with my performance given what i had to go through but i am not sure if i will be running another SF marathon race or the one they put on in Berkeley. I hope my next race in just over a month i am able to finally snag that 1:15 that i want this time.

5,AdvancedRunning,4thwave4father,Some Observations from the Sweat Elite Videos,"Who else has been watching the great training videos coming out of the Sweat Elite YouTube channel? As an amateur runner, it is fascinating to see how the pros are training, for me especially the marathoners, and to hear from their coaches as to why they train the way they do. Some of my main takeaways from the more recent marathon-focused videos are below:

1. It seems like most of these runners tend to do threshold work as intervals rather than longer tempo runs. For example the 1k repeats near HM pace or the 3 x 1 mile at HM pace that are featured in a few of the videos. Coming from the background of doing the Pfitz plans multiple times, where you are prescribed 4-7 mile tempos run at a steady pace, I found this approach interesting. 
2. I wish that I had bottle service in a marathon. It would be so much easier to have bottles with calories that I could grab at prescribed points and toss rather than having to worry about carrying or taking gels. I would also prefer liquid calories to gels, but that's not really possible unless you want to carry a bottle the whole way.
3. Having a coach to program your workout, provide feedback in real time (during the run on big workouts), carry your bottles, and help you to adjust training as you go must be really nice. Hopefully this doesn't come across as jealous, I think it is pretty cool and cool to watch!

Any other observations?",1632331309

### Training

As I mentioned in my pre-race post during my tempo jitters, I have been training very well over the past 2 years, steadily increasing my mileage to an average of 60 mpw over this year and peaking this cycle at an 80 mile week.  I raced a half this spring in 1:24 and was eager to see all that work pay off in the full.  I had no injuries this year and never missed a workout or a long run.  Overall, as solid of a training block as one could expect.

### Pre-race

We arrived at the hotel near the start/finish on Saturday afternoon.  Already had race bibs in hand.  Mostly stayed off my feet that day and relaxed.  Tried to sleep but without a lot of success.  Got to the start in plenty of time and had a chance to do a short jog to get the legs moving.

### Race

Although I hit the halfway point on schedule for a sub 3 hour finish, I should've recognized then that it wasn't in the cards and lived to fight another day.  The humidity felt high and the temps were already about 70.  I didn't realize it until the second loop of the 2 loop course, but I had also already spent some time running into a headwind coming off the ocean.  

As my splits clearly show, it didn't take long after passing the halfway point that it all started to fall apart.  I just couldn't keep it moving.  I haven't felt this bad in a race in a long time.  Had it been a local race that I hadn't traveled to and gotten a hotel for, etc., I might've considered my options but I soldered on.  The last 8-10 miles were miserable.  More demoralizing was the fact that the course seemed to measure a quarter mile long, meaning I had an extra .25 miles to think about what went wrong.

Overall, I pulled in at 3:24 which was somehow good for 20th place overall and 3rd in my age group, but far far away from the sub 3 or BQ dreams of a week ago.

### Post-race

So now I sit on vacation for a week, legs already no longer sore and my nerves telling me to get myself moving again, contemplating my next move.  My former coach checked in on me and is urging me to consider this a long training run and take another swing at a BQ effort in 4-8 weeks under better conditions.  I want her to be right and I really feel like all the indicators told me that I was in better shape than 3:24.  I'm going to get some running shoes on during this trip and think it over.  20th overall suggests that most people struggled and I'm not kidding myself with all the weather excuses, but who knows.  One this is for sure, it's been a very long time since I've been this confused with a race result.

7,AdvancedRunning,adamm_96,Pfitz 18/55 or 12/55,"Signed up for a marathon on Feb 12th, so 20 weeks out.  I'm shooting for 3:15 based on my current fitness which is a 1:31 HM.  

My base:

* Past 6 weeks, I have averaged 40 mpw and following the general structure of Pfitz with a \~10 mile medium-long run during the week and a \~13 mile weekend long run.
* Previous 16 weeks before that, I have averaged 35 mpw with one threshold every week, and one interval workout on half of the weeks.

Question: should I continue to build up my base and do the 12/55 plan starting at the end of November, or is my base already good enough to jump in to 18/55 in two weeks? It looks like the 12 week plan ramps up quicker in the first few weeks compared to the 18 week plan, but both have a few weeks at the start that are below the mileage I'm currently doing.  Thanks!

8,AdvancedRunning,MotivicRunner,World record-holder and seven-time World Marathon Majors winner Keitany retires,"[**From World Athletics**](https://www.worldathletics.org/news/news/mary-keitany-kenya-half-marathon-retires)

Mary Keitany announced her retirement from professional running today. She's such marathon legend that it must be quite frustrating to end her career with being unable to compete in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and a lingering back injury. 

Even though she wasn't getting any younger, it would have been really interesting to see what she could have done in the current generation of Adidas super shoes, given she got 2nd at the 2019 NYC Marathon in [Adizero Pros](https://twitter.com/Rolows_13/status/1191979207959760896).

9,AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Workout of the Week - Floating Fartleks,"Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent  specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas:

* A new workout
* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Floating Fartleks**.

*History:*

From two-time Olympian, and Australian 10,000m record holder, Ben St Lawrence. He is the co-founder and coach of Run Crew, a coaching group and racing team.

*Why:*

This session is great at helping you to become comfortable with being uncomfortable, and that’s essentially what running is all about, right? This mix of hard efforts, with ‘floats’ where you back off the gas but not too much is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to train your body and mind to pick things up even when your body is screaming at you to slow down. The temptation to back off a little on the efforts, or to reduce the float to a jog is always there, but by quieting this little voice and pushing through, you’re getting invaluable practice for the toughest point of the race, the last mile. When the questions start to be asked of you, you will have been to this point (physically and mentally) many times in practice and be able to tell yourself, “I’ve got this!”.

*What:*

* 15 – 20 min easy jog.

* 20 min of fartlek, going 2 min fast (about current 10k effort), 1 min float (just backing off the gas a little, but not too much, approx 30 sec/km slower than your 10km effort), 1 min fast (about current 5k effort or slightly faster), 30 sec float (same as first float). Repeat this for 20 min, finishing with a 2 min effort.

* Jog for 2 min (jog, not float) then run at tempo pace (approx Marathon effort) for 8 min – making the whole workout 30 minutes long.

* 15 – 20 min of easy jogging.

*How:*

There are a few gear changes throughout the session, and no time to really switch off, as long as you keep the floats honest (easier said than done!). The first few efforts feel great, but as the minutes start to tick by, the float recoveries (particularly the 30 sec after a fast 60 sec effort) start to seem shorter and shorter. Regardless of how fatigued you’re feeling, when the watch beeps you’ll find that extra gear and manage to hold on just long enough. You’re teaching yourself that even when every bit of feedback you’re getting is that you need to slow down (or at best, maintain pace) you CAN pick it up again. Even if you mess it up a little and go too hard on one of the efforts, the lessons learned will help you to get more closely dialled in to exactly where your limits are and how that should feel.

I have been using a sub 3:30 marathon training plan this cycle. I have been mostly hitting the paces as prescribed, but I will say that the heat and humidity have done me in a few times. (I probably should’ve been adjusting my paces, but too little too late now.) I thought about doing a test race to gauge my fitness, but any race at this point would be on tired legs from the training, so can that even be used to gauge fitness for marathon pace?",1632316474
11,AdvancedRunning,Low_Society,Smart ways of increasing weekly milage,"Hi All,

I've been holding 75-80 km (46-50 miles) per week for several months now and am looking to increase my weekly mileage, but not sure which method would work best.

For context, ran a 17:20 5k earlier this year, not training for anything in particular in the near future as all races have been cancelled due to covid : (

**Weekly Schedule**

M: Rest

T: Tempo workout, warm up and cool down included, total 16km (10miles)

W: Easy 11km (6.8miles)

T: Easy 11km (6.8miles) + strides

F: Threshold/ speed work, warm up and cool down included, total 10km (6.8miles)

S: Easy 11km (6.8miles)

S: Long run 22km (13.6miles)

Ideally (ignoring time restraints etc) to increase my overall weekly mileage should I;

1. Remove my rest day and start with 5km and slowly build up
2. Do a mid week long run of 16km (10miles)
3. Add 2-3km to each of my easy days
4. Double on a day, would this be a workout day or easy day

23,AdvancedRunning,michaelmf,Help dealing with a sudden loss of fitness,"Through the winter/early spring, I was running about 35-45KM per week, including weekly long runs of about 20KM and interval workouts like (5X1KM at 3:45/KM). I run with a chest strap - The Strava Elevate extension gave me run scores of high 50s to low 60s on my runs. I was also doing a lot of road biking at this time.

At the beginning of May, I suddenly lost the ability to run.

In the span of a week or two, I went from being able to comfortably run a half marathon to barely being able to run 5KM.

The symptoms are that my body just feels completely awful and drained, a highly elevated heart rate and various sensations in my chest.

After taking about one month off trying to recover, I've tried to run around one slow 5KM run per week to see if my body has made any progress. I try to run at a 5:30/KM pace but it usually ends up closer to 5:45. Prior to all this, I would run this route with an avg heart rate of high 140s. Now, its in the 160s.

A few times, I couldn't make the entire 5KM but most times I could, it just really sucked. My run scores during this period went from mid 50s to low 50s to high 40s to low 50s and eventually back to mid 50s. At the beginning of September, I got sick for a few days (not Covid) and the run  scores went back down to low 50s. The run scores mostly match my subjective experience of the discomfort during the run.

During this time, I also stopped intense cycling. I found I could continue to ride if I kept my heart rate below 150BPM. If i did this, I could slowly and casually ride distances of around 75KM.

Without running in my schedule, I also took up swimming as a replacement which seems to be okay (I swim incredibly slow and casually).

I've met with my doctor many times and unfortunately am completely at a loss for what's going on here:

Things I've tried that hasn't helped/shown anything:

- anti-histamines

- puffer

- bloodtest

- EKG scan

- Chest x-ray

- blood pressure

As far as I know, I've never had Covid. I also took a covid antibody test that showed I didn't have Covid.

I've been hoping to see an internal medicine expert since June but my appointment hasn't even been scheduled yet.

Has anyone experienced something similar to this?

Does anyone have any thoughts on what could be causing all this?

Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions on things I could test/that may help my situation?

**Training**

Having taken up running a little over 18 months ago to lose weight and become more active, this would be my first race. I was due to compete in a half marathon in June but it has since been rescheduled to October due to Covid restrictions. Coming into the race my training was averaging around 30-40km per week but was relatively inconsistent, by the weekend of the race I’d kept this up for around 5/6 weeks, with much of the summer before that being lucky to get anything more than 2 training runs in per week due to work fatigue and the rescheduled races lowering my motivation.

I had run a 39:23 in the Spring on a GPS based time trial along a straight/flat course so this was my A goal. I felt that I probably wasn't in as good shape as I was then, but hopeful the occasion, crowds and other runners would help me along.

Generally, due to my relatively low mileage and the fact I was targeting HM’s, I’ve tried to include a decent amount of threshold work at HM pace to maximise the quality of my training. Usually I’ll try and do a 2hr long run per week, but this has not been entirely consistent.

I had a couple of Half Marathons coming up after this 10k and so didn’t really want to taper to any great extent as my focus was really on getting a sub 1:30 HM at either/both of those events. For some unexplainable reason on the Wednesday before the race I decided to go out and run 39k at around 5:00/km pace. I have absolutely no idea what was going through my head, I stepped out the front door for an easy long run and got completely carried away and had almost run a marathon distance. I suppose I reasoned that it would all be good training for the HM’s, what I stupidly hadn’t thought about is just how badly it would tire my legs for the weekends 10k! Suffice to say that my legs were not in good shape at all in the lead up to the race, I had a 30 min massage on the Friday evening as a bit of a last resort but I was convinced that I’d be even lucky to dip under 40 minutes.

**Pre-Race**

Given how my legs felt and the fact I felt a PB was unlikely, I was incredibly relaxed heading into the race. All the pressure was off. I had a large bowl of pasta the night before and even stayed up until midnight to watch Raducanu win the US Open and all the post show etc. I hadn’t really told anyone about the details of the race and just wanted to run it for myself, this was a really nice head space to be in.

Alarm went at 6am, had my standard morning run breakfast of a little porridge, banana and coffee and slowly got ready. On my jog down to the park where the start was my legs actually felt \*okay\*. The starting area and route as a whole was entirely around the area of the city that I had been running day in day out for the last year, it all just felt so familiar and calm. I’d probably arrived a little too early though and ended up having almost an hour to wait around before the start. I did some drills and completed my warm up just generally tried to be mindful and take in the amazing atmosphere of my first race. Eventually the time had come to head to the start line. The fastest corral was sub 50 mins and so I knew I needed to be at least a half decent way into the pack to avoid having to run through just under 50min runners early on.

**Race**

Apparently I hadn’t been quite as quick in getting towards the front of the pack for the start as the first 200m involved a bit of jostling and nipping in-between slower runners to get to my pace. Being my first race I wasn’t exactly sure of the etiquette but made sure to give as much space as possible when passing, but I probably looked a little erratic trying to nip in and find spaces to pass! Eventually I settled in with a small group. The first KM was completed in 3:47, ludicrous pace I thought. ‘Don’t go out too fast, don’t blow up’ kept going through my head. I decided to ease off and dropped to a 3:49 2nd KM and 3:54 for the 3rd and 4th. I felt great, the crowds, the familiar roads and the beautiful weather felt like they were worth another 10s/KM to me. I realised I was going to run close to my 5k PB yet still felt I had a lot more to give.

I decided to roll the dice and trust my legs. 5th KM was 3:46 to bring me to 19:08 for the first 5k, this was uncharted territory and my mindset was to stick at that pace for as long as I could. KMs 6-8 were all completed in similar splits. By the 9th KM I was aware that I was operating at my limit and the temperature had started to climb. 9th KM was done in 3:55 and I didn’t think I had anything left for the last KM, I knew I was on for a PB though and so really dug in. It was at this point a group of 2/3 runners caught me and I made the decision to use them and try to go at their pace for the last KM. With my HR pretty much at max I completed the last KM in 3:38 and finished a couple of seconds ahead of the group that had caught me.

Chip time was 38:08 resulting in a negative split for the race, seeing the last 5k completed in 19:00.

**Post-race thoughts**

Wow, just wow. I can’t believe it took me so long to get into running. I’ve never experienced an atmosphere like that where I am actually a participant. Consider me hooked. A big thanks to all the organisers and volunteers, you could really tell that everyone was so pleased for the return of races after Covid. I relaxed on the beach for a little while before gently jogging home, grabbing a shower and then heading back to the course to support a friend who was competing in the Marathon event proper.

What is clear is that I need to be much more regimented with my training, or at least get some more consistency. Ideally not doing things like destroying your legs 4 days before a race etc! What was encouraging though is just how much residual fitness I’d seemingly retained throughout quite an inactive summer. I have joined a local running club and will try to attend at least one session per week there, with the rest of my mileage being done on my own, but to a plan rather than just what I feel like on the day. I think that 10KM - HM distance is going to be my area of focus over the coming year.

I do wonder that if my legs had been a little fresher could I have dipped into the 37:xx? I think to speculate on that though would be a little greedy, 38:08 was already wildly beyond what I had expected before the race.

Using the Jack Daniels running calculator a 38:08 would suggest a sub 1:30 HM is easily possible, in fact it comes out at an equivalent of sub 1:25, of course this assumes good conditions and that I have the mileage in my legs to run that time. I’m not so sure about that and so my goal is still to run sub 1:30, enjoy the occasion and bank my first HM.",1632228226

### Training
I basically spent the last couple months challenging myself to up my mileage drastically. Recently sober from weed, I had run [some PRs in shorter distances](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ose2zy/choosing_a_target_marathon_time_after_two_new_prs/) that really raised my confidence. At the time I was running like 50-60 mile weeks and feeling ok about my progress but also feeling like I should be capable of more. Around that time I saw a viral video of a pregnant Makenna Myler running around the same monthly mileage as me (250mi) and it kind of lit a fire under my ass. This might not sound very PC or kind, but I thought that if a pregnant woman (albeit a pro) can match my mileage then I'm probably capable of going much harder...

The very next week I upped my mileage from 63mi to 103mi on 6 days/week with no doubles (dumb and reckless, I know) and some how managed to not injure myself. The next week, I approached things a bit smarter and did 115mi with doubles. The week after I added workouts while keeping my easy days about 8:15-8:30/mi. I ended August with slightly over 460 miles of running. 

By early September, some of my easy runs had average heart rate readings barely in zone 2, with a fair chunk of time in zone 1. The fitness boost from the mileage was almost immediate and obvious. My main goal was just to prevent any single run from killing my legs and it seemed to work. I had several workouts with 2x3mi, 3x2mi or a straight 10km @ half marathon pace (6:20-6:30/mi) sandwiched in middle distance runs and in some cases my long runs. Most of these were done in 80F+ degrees and felt awful which shook my confidence a bit. 

Pre-race week I tapered slightly from 103mi to 90mi, then just 30mi in the days leading up to the Friday race.

### Pre-race
My legs felt ready, but I was super nervous as this was just my second half marathon ever. I ran 5km to the race for a warm up and noticed my easy run heart rate was much higher than normal which I definitely fixated on too much. I took a caffeinated gel with beet root juice before the warm up, and another gel 30 min prior to the gun. Plenty of water all day. Since this was a night race starting at 7:30pm, it was beginning to get dark and I had been obsessing a bit about the race all day.

### Race
It was a small field, since this was just a smaller, local half marathon. There were about 50-60 of us registered I think. Based on past results, I knew my projected time would place me in the top 10 at least. Immediately in the first mile, I noticed that I was in the lead pack, with the top guy looking to be around at 6 min per mile pace. Out of lack of experience, I found myself following one guy who appeared to be at 6:30 pace and stuck by him until the 2 mile split. When I noticed we had slowed to 6:40, I consciously sped up a bit and eventually passed him. I caught up to the 3rd place guy about half a mile later and stuck by him until he too started to slow around mile 8 where I noticed we had slowed to over 6:30 pace.

By this point, it was very dark out and the race had moved to an off road packed dirt and gravel trail from mile 3 until mile 13. I had a light on my flip belt and that gave me just enough visibility to see 5-8ft in front of me. After passing the last guy and taking what I later realized was 3rd place, I was running a smoother, faster pace and settled into a rhythm where it felt like I was getting tunnel vision from the lack of visibility and dimly lit path in front of me. The run didn't quite feel difficult until about mile 11. 

The entire race I was terrified of hitting a physical wall from leg fatigue which never really came. Around miles 8-10 that feeling turned into confidence when I realized it probably wouldn't happen. I had enough energy to kick the last stretch well under 6min/mi and finish strong. I crossed the line feeling like I could've kept going. Maybe I sandbagged my time estimate? But I hit my goal and felt great about it. 

### Post-race
The winner finished in about 1:20:00, it wasn't exactly a race with any super fast people in it but I was really happy with my top 3 finish (2nd in age group). It felt like my high mileage training + workouts done in the summer heat helped me a ton when racing at a much cooler temperature at night. Most of my workouts were far more mentally difficult than this race and I think the preparation showed. In a morning + road half marathon, I think I can do even better at my current fitness level. 

### What's next?
Sub 1:25:00 was the milestone I was hoping for on the road to a sub 3 hr marathon. My marathon is scheduled for March in Napa Valley so I have plenty of time to continue building my aerobic fitness with triple digit mileage weeks before starting a structured marathon plan. After this race, I'm feeling far less doubt about running sub 3. If only a month and a half of really high mileage can produce results like these, I'm feeling really good about my chances with several months of time to prepare.",1632188696

Known internet troll and co founder of LetsRun, Robert Johnson, wrote an op Ed today on LetsRun linking a quote of Norm Macdonald’s about sprinters as proof that Norm would agreed with Robert about intersex athletes.

Norm’s quote: “i feel that one of the basic requirements of being a sprinter is having legs.”

Robert Johnson even goes so far as to pretend that Norm joked about intersex athletes instead of sprinters:

“Imagine for a moment that instead of talking about Pistorius, Macdonald was talking about an intersex or transgender athlete and said the following:

“Let’s imagine you are an elite women’s athlete…and then you go home and say to your partner, “Oh I lost, honey.”

“Who’d you lose to?”

“The girl with functioning testes.”

That seems pretty ridiculous, right?”

# Training

I had done one marathon before (Berlin, 2018) and many half-marathons. While my half-marathon PR is good (1:24), I have never properly trained before and this showed in Berlin: I showed up injured and very under-trained, but still managed to pull 3:39:52. This time, I was determined to do something different. I've looked at many plans in my time as a runner and am attracted to the intensity of Pfitz, but I knew I should stick to something that was more my level as I've never consistently run more than 35 miles per week except for a few weeks at a time.

I had planned to run the CIM last year, before it was canceled due to the pandemic, and had already downloaded their pre-made plan for intermediate runners. It seemed comfortably within my skill level and would be an opportunity to introduce speedwork, which I don't generally do, alongside some runs that seemed well within my ability to handle. It wasn't the most ambitious, but it seemed doable and I ultimately wanted this race to be an acknowledgment of the reality of my running ability (including the time I have to prepare) and not a repeat of my previous efforts, which are more characterized by my wishful thinking about what I know I ultimately have the capacity to do but don't have the time to properly build up to. The theme of this race and its preparation, for me, was slow and steady wins the race. I wanted to stay in my lane, be consistent, not get injured, and make it to the finish line feeling nowhere near as defeated as during my last marathon.

Another factor in my decision to choose a training plan that didn't push me as much was that I moved around 4 weeks into my training from a cool, hilly, rainy place much like San Francisco to a place that was extremely hot, humid, and flat. I knew the key to making it through this race, given the completely different conditions, would be to stick to the plan as much as possible and so picking something that was a stretch or a challenge would be a recipe for failure. 

Ultimately, I mostly kept to the plan except with regards to the speedwork. I am not a morning runner and, where I was, even waking up early to run hardly improved the conditions. About halfway through the plan I stopped sticking religiously to the speedwork prescribed and instead picked a few exercises that I liked (mostly ones involved 3-4 mins of 10k pace alternated with easy paces) and could maintain in the heat without feeling like I was going to expire in the road. My main goal was to keep up with the volume, which averaged around 35 miles per week and peaked around 45. I was mostly able to do this, although I got sick towards the end of training and had to shift my 20 mile run out by a week, meaning I missed the last 16-miler of my plan. In the three weeks before the race, I only ran a few times because life got in the way. Still, I was hopeful that the increase in efficiency I would gain from not running in 85+ degree, humid weather would help me be consistent. 

# Pre-Race

I woke up long before my alarm - no surprise there. I had a small breakfast of Grape Nuts and peanut butter, did some SAM warmups, and went with my family to find the start. The previous day I'd had a mild panic about my nutrition plan for the race - I'd only purchased an energy bar and two gel packs because I could fit only that in my pockets. At the last minute, I decided to put all of that in my running backpack alongside my phone and a banana I grabbed from the hotel lobby out of paranoia that I would somehow miss the two GU stations that the marathon had in place.

The start was rather strange compared to the races that I'm used to. As I mentioned, I've only done Berlin before and the pre-race there is at least an hour long, with huge crowds and tightly-controlled corrals. I've also done half marathons and I'm used to a good deal more hullabaloo around the start. Perhaps it was a result of the pandemic-related accommodations, but the corrals were not coordinated at all and, by the time I arrived, it seemed like hardly anyone was running the marathon. Runners, in general, are an anxious bunch that like to jockey for position and so I was shocked that the corrals were almost empty until shortly before the race began. Only 3 minutes before the start, they announced that we should get to our corrals. I found my 3:30 pacer and got next to him. Because of corona, they released runners in waves of 5; still, I only left very shortly after the gun went off which surprised me as I am used to a long wait to get the elites and first waves out. This was a pleasant surprise - now the only question was to see if my hope that the lack of heat would help me attack hills I was completely untrained for would be proven true.

# Race

The race went more or less according to my wildest (realistic) hopes. A group of us attached ourselves to the 3:30 pacer very early on. While I had anticipated that the cooler weather would be a boon, I had totally failed to account for just how much energy I saved by not having to think about what I was doing. It was the first time I had ever bothered to stay with a pacer because I don't really need them for the half-marathon distance that I normally do. We went out fast, around 7:30/7:45 pace, and kept that up through the early, flat stages of the marathon. Our pacer was good about letting us know that he was doing this because of the hills we would face and also let us know that the course was officially unofficially 26.4 miles, so we needed to be a bit faster than what we might think if we were to hit our time. 

It was dark and our group was quiet - a couple of jocular guys would call out the height of each of the first couple of hills, but they fell out of our group fairly quickly. After a summer of running alone along the same track in the same place over and over again, it was extremely refreshing to be somewhere with great scenery and in a group of (quiet) like-minded runners. The crowd was (and remained for most of the race) relatively anemic. We saw especially few spectators at this early stage - mostly people out for early morning exercise and a few dedicated individuals bundled up warm against the cool morning. For the most part, though, our only company was each other and the gentle sounds of the sea beside us.

The sun began to rise just as we approached the Golden Gate Bridge and the 10k mark. Here, we slowed down drastically as the real hills began. This is where I ate my first gel and a banana I'd swiped from the hotel. From the Golden Gate Bridge onwards through mile 16, the course is more or less entirely rolling, steep hills. Staying with the pacer was crucial to my overall race. I have a bad tendency to try to attack hills and get to the top as quickly as possible, which would have been a disastrously ill-advised strategy for this race. I learned quite a lot about how to manage hills by staying with the pacer, who remained cheerful and lively throughout this difficult portion. He informed us that it was his third time pacing and that this was by far the hardest course. Apparently, they'd added 1300 feet of net elevation gain compared to previous years. Not sure if this is true or not, but it certainly made me feel more accomplished.

We rounded our way back to the Golden Gate Bridge and, while crossing back over it, reached the halfway mark at around 1:45. At this point, our group had thinned to around ten people. Here, I ate my second gel and the power bar. Shortly thereafter, at one of the aid stations with GU, I took a bag and consumed that as well. 

By the time we got through the hilly portion, around mile 16, there were only a couple of us left. I knew that I had to make a decision about whether or not to stay with the group as we were going a bit to slow for comfort. By mile 18, only me and the pacer were left of the original group (that I can remember) but a few new people had glommed on. 

At this point, I was consistently ahead of the pacer and comfortably uncomfortable. I decided to leave him behind in the interest of building up a buffer to definitely break 3:30:00. From this point onwards, I was more or less alone. I grabbed a final bag of GU snacks at the 20-mile mark and stopped trying to hold back. By this point, I knew that I would finish, but I was unsure if my decision to break away would deliver me the time that I wanted. I had started my running tracker a bit early, so the timing was off, but I wasn't sure by how much. On top of that, I had the pacer's warning in my mind that the course was a bit long. I decided to make a gamble: with the hills over, I was on more familiar territory. I'd trained flat and hot all summer and my body wasn't yet feeling as tired as it had been during some of my longer runs, especially the 20-milers. More than that, I was mentally much less exhausted than I was during my training because I hadn't had to focus on managing my water, nutrition, and route. I decided to give it everything I had and risk totally flaming out towards the end in the hope that I would make up the time I had lost and eke out a 3:30 finish. At the very least, in contrast to my previous marathon experience, which ended in more or less a stream of people passing me as I tottered to the finish, I was consistently passing people on my way home. This alone was a gratifying experience, even if I came in over 3:30.

I finished strong and was gratified to learn that I'd broken the mark. When I checked later, it turned out the pacer finished at just over 3:30. I was happy for him, but also happy for my decision to break away. I genuinely don't think I could have done better than this - any faster and I would have injured myself or crashed out early.

# Post-race thoughts

The post-race was a stripped-down affair not really worth noting. Some stray thoughts:

1. I was very glad that my intuition proved correct. I was hoping that the heat/elevation tradeoff would more or less equal out, and it did. I'm sure my form in those last six miles was less than exemplary, but I don't feel too terrible one day after. Mostly normal aches and pains that I would expect from any marathon, but especially one with terrain like that.

2. Running with a pacer was a revelation - I've read some very bad stories on reddits and had come in leery. I'm not sure if mine was an exceptional experience, but I would definitely do so again. I learned a lot about hill management and pace management just by running, benefited greatly from the sense of silent camaraderie that we formed until the group fell apart, and ultimately think I wouldn't have been able to do this without the pacer and the group.

3. Again, I'm not sure whether it was the pandemic-related restrictions but the race itself, in terms of infrastructure and logistics, felt underwhleming. The crowd was also fairly anemic. The start felt like some of the smaller, local races that I've been in - almost entirely informal and really no crowd control (also no crowd? When did people start? I'm really scratching my head at this because there \*were\* thousands of people running but I saw maybe a couple hundred people, if that, at the beginning with me). There was only one pacer per time group (that I saw) - again, not sure if this is because of the pandemic but I had expected multiple pacers for different groups, which I've seen in different races of various sizes, larger and smaller, before. I would be curious to know others' experiences. 

# Question for readers

If you've made it this far, I hope you weigh in on anything that stood out to you. I'm particularly interested in the hive mind's opinions on the following questions:

1. Given my time in this race, does it seem feasible to go under 3 on a flatter course in about 1/1.5 years' time if I up my training and become even more consistent? I feel that it's within my reach - I have San Francisco and Sacramento 2022 both in the books. Given that I've now run two marathons with decent(ish) times, and this time I only did 35/40-ish mpw, there are probably a lot of gains to be made by becoming even more consistent with my training and upping my mileage.

2. How do most of you manage nutrition? The bag ultimately didn't weigh me down that much, but I would like to run as unburdened as possible - however, that can only work if the course provides for it or you carry what you can in your pockets. What do you normally do? I'd like to improve that part of my race next time.",1632174912

As a background, I just ran my 5th marathon.  Last year I jumped from 3:48 to 3:13.  The goal this year was to go sub-3 and a Boston Qualifier, ended up running a 3:00:20.  Still super happy with the growth, but my coach thought I'd be able to run a 2:50-2:55 and I thought for sure I'd be able to at least run a 2:56 at a minimum.

I ran 663 miles in the past 3.5 months, averaging high 40's per week, peaking at mid-high 60's for mileage a few weeks.  Mixed variety of workouts:

\- 400m repeats up to 16, average 74 seconds

\- Yasso 800's at 2:48 consistently up to 12x

\- Tempo runs up to 10 miles (6:18 pace)

\- Surge (Fartlek) runs with 2min of 5:30 surges with easy runs in-between up to 10x on 8 miles

\- 2 Speed workouts a week, one long run (went up to 24 miles) easy runs the rest of week (7:45-8min pace) with a day off one day a week.

My long runs were great up till 18 miles.  I ran an 18 miler at a 6:43 pace, then finished my 20 at 6:46, 22 at a 6:48, dying out to low 7 paces at the end.

My short-distance paces are on-point (5:44 5k, 6:08 10k, haven't done half marathon but I'm assuming its around a 6:20 based on how I felt at the end of my 10 miler).

I'm thinking about running another one here at the end of October to try and nail that qualifier and was looking to see if anybody has any advice or specific training routines to build up this short-distance speeds to be able to nail those last 6-8 miles.

For context, I was at a 6:47 pace at mile 19 and was knicking into 6:46 and was hoping to surge at the end to drop it down, mainly going for negative splits, as that's how I ended my 18 miler surging sub-6:20's for 3 miles at the end.

Hi everyone,

I'm currently a masters student in sport psychology and would like to start posting a topic article once a week to get a discussion going around mental performance, and different mental skills people use to compete in their events.  Lately, I've been digging into the literature on self-talk in ultra marathons, but this was the first I've seen that looked at the 800.

First, I'd like to say that the design of the study was absolutely brutal on the participants, but they had pretty good accolades for being relatively older runners. Multiple baseline studies are no joke, especially when they were running three 800s nearly all out in a single session, then repeating the 800s for another few weeks. 

The individual self-talk program improved their running time, but this could have also been due to the fact that they were running an 800 every other day. But it leads me to asking, what do you tell yourself when you're running flat out? Are you even talking to yourself?

Hi there - I am an experienced runner that runs every single day (about 60ish MPW, with usually one 12-15 mile long run).

I’ve been gearing up to train for NYC and was following a 16 week plan, but I hadn’t been feeling that great and backed off a lot of the speed work and just focused on getting my miles up and going long (to about 16). 

About three weeks ago, I had a major setback with an infection and emergency surgery, and had to take one full week off running and the week after that felt pretty awful too (still ran every day, but reduced mileage and no workouts or LR). This was about 11 weeks out from the marathon. 

Now we are about 8 weeks out from the NYC marathon and I did my long run yesterday (18) and finally felt good again, but I almost feel as if I’m starting my training from scratch. Is it crazy to try to push for a time goal if I start incorporating more speed work now (in addition to weekly long runs)? I ran 3:27 in the NYC 2019 marathon (my first marathon) and 3:16 in the 2020 LA marathon (4 months after). 

I was hoping to beat my 3:16 time - is it too late to start putting in speed work now to achieve this goal? In late June with 0 speed work for over a year I ran a 40:45 10K in 80 degree heat and 80% humidity. I also have a ten mile race this Sunday which can hopefully be a good indicator as well. 

TLDR; is 8 weeks of incorporating speed work before the marathon enough time to try for a time goal (for an experienced runner whose mileage has already been up/has been preparing with long slow runs already)?

47,AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Coe vs Aouita vs ...Carlos Lopes?,"Hi all - still trying my best to post more ""advanced"" discussion topics when I can find the time.

Today I want to ask about the modern marathon, and more specifically, why it has progressed at such a faster rate than the track events have.

Pretend that it's the year 1985:

* Coe's still lighting it up and his 1:41.73 in the 800m is the world record on the track. This will ultimately be the [3rd fastest 800m of all time](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middle-long/800-metres/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;timing=electronic&amp;page=1&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-29&amp;lastDay=2021-09-15) still, even in 2021.
* Said Aouita's hot off breaking Cram's 1500m record with a time of 3:29.46 and this will also stand the test of time, being the [22nd fastest of all time in 2021](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middle-long/1500-metres/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;page=1&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-28&amp;lastDay=2021-09-14). Cram's mile time of 3:46.32 a few weeks prior will also go on to be the 4th fastest of all time in 2021.
* The longer distances don't stand as well, with Fernando Mamede's 27:13.81 10k ultimately placing 127th all time, and even Said's future 5k, that will break the 13 minute barrier, placing 90th all time. These are still quite competitive times by 2021's standards though.
* Carlos Lopes' 2:07.12 marathon though? Who would have guessed that this would only tie the personal best of [299th on the all time list in 2021](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/road-running/marathon/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&amp;drop=regular&amp;fiftyPercentRule=regular&amp;page=3&amp;bestResultsOnly=true&amp;firstDay=1899-12-27&amp;lastDay=2021-09-13). Even Dinsamo's world record in 1988 is only tied with 238th on the all time PR list. You need to go down to the 96th spot just to find the fastest marathon ran **before the year 2000** (Khalid Khannouchi's 2:05.42).

And this underscores the crazy disparity of the last 3 decades of this sport's progression. While world class times on the track 35 years ago would still be considered quite competitive today, the marathon has accelerated at a jarring pace. Certainly a 2:07 is a fast time still, but I think most of us wouldn't rank it in the same category as a 1:41 800m or a 3:46 mile. So what happened?

Clearly the shoes play a role. Take a look for yourself of all of the top times run since 2017, when the 4% was first released. But surprisingly, even absent times of the last 4 years, the breakneck improvement of the marathon is still true. Even before the super shoes, we had Kimetto and Mutai running 2:03 in Berlin together. And this is where the conversation becomes puzzling.

So I'm turning it to the room to debate what happened here:

* Beyond the modern ""super shoes"", has shoe technology really improved that much more on the roads than spikes have on the track?
* Was the marathon world record always soft because the roads didn't have the same ""notoriety"" as the track until recently?
* In a similar vein, were we just closer to the human limit on the track than we were on the roads and now the roads are catching up?
* Is it from the huge improvement in prize winnings on the road pulling younger talent over (the roads were always jested as the ""retirement home"" for track athletes)?
* Did Renato Canova come in here and just change the way that we train for the marathon? Do we need a similar training ""enlightenment"" for the track?
* Something else entirely?",1632103390
48,AdvancedRunning,dirtyStick84,Critique my strength training regimen,"Up until the past few months I've stayed mostly away from doing any 'real' weightlifting during run training blocks, sticking mostly to short bodyweight movement circuits.  Since returning to running after a 3 month break I have taken the exercises provided in rehab and progressed them with added weight/volume.  The split squat particularly has been amazing in helping the healing process and I believe the biggest contributor to my recovery thus far.  Anyways I am taking this training block to train with a buddy who is fairly new to running, this allows me to help him and to give myself a ramp up training block where I can train at lower speeds letting my body heal.  At this point I would like to get my weight slowly down to where I was running at before (bmi \~24 -&gt; \~22) but wondering if what I am doing in the gym is fully helping my overall cause/goals which are to firstly return safely to previous running level, next to get the bmi down to about 22 then finally to have a solid regimen I can do year round to hopefully help my prevent future injuries as best as possible.  Well here is basically what I do in the gym 2-3 times a week:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 30 min cardio (elliptical | rower | treadmill)  
\&gt; 3 X (12 Bulgarian Split Squat @ 95lb / 15 box jumps / 30 deadbug with exercise ball)  
\&gt; 3 X (12 Hex Bar Deadlift @ 155lb / 15 lateral box jump overs / 35 sit-ups)  
\&gt; 3 X (10 pullups / 10 dips / 10 oblique cable chop)  
\&gt; 3 X (10 reverse rows / 25 pushups / 60s hollow hold)

&amp;#x200B;

How might you tweak this to more specifically for say: 

\&gt; In a marathon training block  
\&gt; While trying to drop about a pound a week for a few weeks   
\&gt; In the off season

49,AdvancedRunning,scoofusa,Building MPW for Pfitz marathon training...heart rate vs pace?,"Hello, 

Me: 43 / M, 5'10"" / 187 lbs, been running since 2018. 

Best times: Marathon: 3:32, Half: 1:36.

Goal: 3:25 marathon in May 2022.

I currently run about 25 MPW and I'm trying to build miles before starting the Pfitz 55/18 plan for a marathon in May. I was running about 36 MPW in 2019 before string of injuries hit me and I've been taking it very easy to avoid having to take more time off. My goal is to get to 40+ MPW by the end of December and maintain that for a couple weeks before starting the plan. I'm thinking I'll do mostly GA runs with some hills and strides thrown in plus one R day each week until starting the plan. No tempo or speed work. I just want to add miles without hurting myself. 

I tried to do a GA pace run this morning. Going by Pfitz's description that means 9:00-9:48 per mile or 127-143 HR. I was right at 9:00 for the first mile and my HR never got above 124. So I sped up to keep it between 135-140 for the remainder of the run and ended up running long stretches at 8:00 per mile. This was with a Garmin heart rate strap and a Fenix 6 Pro so I think pace and HR were both fairly accurate.

I've never used HR for training before but this got me thinking...if I perform better when I focus on heart rate, am I selling myself short if I focus on pace for training? It's cool and overcast outside so that certainly played a part, but my resting HR goes very low when I'm in a regular running routine so I wonder if I am just in better cardiovascular shape than I realized. Of course, my volume is low. Increasing speed takes a greater toll on the rest of my body so there's that to consider. 

Just wondering...if a given training pace is supposed to match a HR in Z3 but my actual heart rate is in Z2, should I speed up? For the next two-ish months I'm primarily building mileage. Should I run in Z2 for the majority of my miles or save those for recovery days?",1632078473

The first mile (almost all flat, slight hills as we neared the one mile mark) I came through between 5:07-5:10, and was feeling great. Legs weren't tired at all and my breathing was relatively easy. Then the second mile had a lot of rolling hills - there was almost no flat part in it. I came through that mile at about 5:25, but that's when my problems started. At about mile 2.3-2.4, there was a final hill which basically killed me. I went up it fine, but as I hit the top I realized that I couldn't really lift my legs up and regain my previous pace, so I suffered through until the finish. the final 1.1 miles (which barring that hill were mostly downhill/flat) I did in about 6:15, which is a pace of about 5:40-ish per mile.

I came here 15 weeks ago to ask if my goal of 3.30 marathon by early october was realistic given the time i had left to train and my old PR:s. (See original post)

Since then I have kept up with my training religiously, only missing a couple of runs with a slight twisted ankle 2 months ago. I peaked for mileage at 49, and the training block included 7 weeks which had a 20+ mile long run.

I broke some PR:s almost by accident during the training:

My HM time went from 1.45 ish to 1.36.02, ran solo. I hadnt ran an all out HM before so tbf the old time might not reflect earlier conditioning i had.

I recently ran 42.17 on a 10k run, not completely maxing out on HR and feeling like i could've kept up the pace indefinitely

62,AdvancedRunning,tommsyeah,Am I ready for a sub 20 5k?,"23M

I have my first ever 5k parkrun in 9 days from now. 

Ran a 20’59” (4’12” min/km) 5k at the end of June
- it was a solo TT (not planned! And unevenly paced. I’d headed out for a tempo run and started out faster and decided to turn it into a 5k TT)
- I was running 25-35 km/week at the time
- I was only doing easy runs, no speed work at all
- long runs were 12-15km long 
- ran the TT with the Nike Pegasus 37

Since then, in last 3 months:
- I have been running 35-43 km/week
- long runs have been 14-18km
- I ran my first HM on August 22 . I finished in 1h 40m 56s). I went out a bit conservatively as I had never run that distance (and it was my first ever race) and I was afraid of bonking hard. Ended up running the first 10k of the HM in 50’30” and the last 10k of the HM in 45’05”. Last 5k was 21’35” (4’19”/Km). Last km was sub 4 min/km pace
- did some occasional tempo runs (usually 20 min long) or intervals to add some speed

I signed up for the 5k yesterday just for fun! 
So I haven’t been training specifically for a sub 20 min 5k (or for a 5k at all to be fair) but now that I’ve signed up I’m thinking I could try to aim for my first ever sub 20? Or is it absolutely crazy?

Today I did the following workout
- 1k @ 3’55”. 2 min rest
- 1k @ 3’56”. 2 min rest
- 1k @ 3’52”. 2 min rest
- 800m @ 3’06” (3’52”/km pace). 1’30” rest
- 800m @ 3’04” (3’48”/km pace). 1’30” rest
- 800m @ 3’02 (3’46”/km pace)

I did it on a track using the Pegasus 37. 
The 5k is 9 days away. Would it be crazy to attempt (for the first time in my life) a sub 20 min 5k? It would be 1 min (12s/km) faster than my June 5k but:
- I have run consistently since June 
- I have been running longer long runs and slightly more mileage, as well as occasional speed work
- I will be using the Saucony Endorphin Speed as opposed to the Pegasus 37
- mentally it will be easier to push myself I guess as it’s an organised race and not a solo TT

I am thinking I could head out @ 4’00”/km - 4’05”/km and try to hang on, and then try to get a sub 4 min last km to end under 20 minutes! What do you think? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",1631907970

**How/when did you start running?**

Running always had my heart, dating back to my first race at age 9.

From ages 11 to 19, I attended a sleepaway summer camp in New Hampshire that had a traditional end-of-session 4-mile run that every camper and counselor had to do. The out-and-back course was ridiculously tough, out-and-back, descending 404 feet over the first two miles and climbing the same distance on the return. I always did well, though, placing high for my age group in the first few years and winning the whole thing in each of my last five years.

All the while, I also tried to convince myself I was a good baseball player.

After seeing that I didn’t have much of a future in baseball after middle school once I got shelled in my first outing on the mound in freshman ball, I joined the track &amp; field team as a sophomore (I had already done cross country). I wasn’t the fastest on either team, yet worked my butt off to become an All-State performer in each sport as a senior and get some attention from colleges.

I ran collegiately for a mid-major DI program and didn’t reach my potential by any stretch of the imagination. I often skipped practice and didn’t do the necessary things to get better (nutrition, sleep, etc.), but by the grace of God, my coach saw promise and kept me around. I turned out to be a dependable scorer in cross country and hit my peak as a junior when I earned the award for “Most Improved Athlete” at our end-of-the-year banquet.

After college, I jumped in one half marathon on a whim to pace a former rival in a full (I finished in 1:16:14) and not long after, stopped running completely for 10 years. I wasn’t burned out. I got caught up in other things that weren’t necessarily good for me and tried to fill the void with just about everything else. Plus, I thought I hurt my knee in a bad way, which scared me.

Running is so deeply engrained in my fiber that once I picked it back up four years ago, it was like two old friends meeting up again. Don’t get me wrong: Those first few months SUCKED. As I worked harder and trusted myself more, I saw marginal gains. Then I joined a local track club and things really took off. I am in better shape than I ever was in college and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me in this sport, even though I’m not getting younger.

Onward and upward, folks. That’s the only way to go!

**PRs?**

5K – 15:23 

10K – 32:15 

HM – 1:09:32 

FM – 2:36:53

**Next Race?**

I will be racing the 2021 Chicago Marathon on Sunday, October 10, as part of the American Development Program. Qualifying for the ADP was a goal I set and achieved last year with my 1:09:32 PR in the half marathon before COVID turned the world on its head. My plan was to run both the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon in 2020, but chose to forgo the opportunity to race Boston this fall in order to maintain my spot in the ADP and hopefully snag another major.

**Goals this year?**

First and foremost, I want to be injury-free for a full calendar year.

Secondly, I want to keep building on – and learn from – what I did in the past.

Otherwise, I would like to PR at the Chicago Marathon (sub-2h30 goal).

**Favorite shoes to train or race in?**

I have a steady rotation of training shoes, but favor the Brooks Ghost and Saucony Endorphin Speed (Those are actually the two pairs of shoes I grabbed before I evacuated Louisiana for two weeks due to Hurricane Ida). I use the Ghost for general runs and long runs; I grab the Speeds for aerobic tempos, regular tempos, and race-specific long run workouts.

If I race, I grab the Vaporfly or whatever is the new iteration, except for the Alphafly. I started out in the Vaporfly 4% Flyknit back in 2018 at the Rocket City Marathon and used them again at the Boston Marathon in 2019. Soon after, I switched to the Vaporfly Next% and will continue to use those or the Vaporfly Next%2, which I’m excited to bring out for the Chicago Marathon.

**What do you think has been the greatest contributor to your success in running?**

Can I name several?

If not, it’s impossible for me to narrow down.

If I can, I would start with my competitive fire and unquenchable desire to improve. That goes for all areas of my life, but especially running. I want to see how far and hard I can push myself.

On top of that, I have an analytical mind and have an innate ability to lock into a pace. Back in college, I often led workouts because I could hit the exact pace we needed without a watch (Actually, I never wore a watch until I started running again in March of 2017).

Lastly, I would say my work ethic – both inside and outside of training. I learned that from my parents, who are both self-employed and built their respective businesses from the ground up. Seeing that growing up and knowing that my parents did as much as they could to provide me and my sister with a comfortable life truly set me on the road to know the value of a work ethic.

**If you had a year to train, with no other distractions, how fast do you think you could get?**

Much faster than I am today, especially if I had access to elite recovery methods.

**What’s your favorite distance to race and why?**

Hands down, it’s the half marathon.

Anything shorter than a 5-mile or 10K feels like a sprint.

It’s nearly impossible to right the ship in a 5K (if you hit the wall early) and we all know how unpredictable and dependent on other variables marathons can be. If you get perfect weather and nail your hydration and nutrition, you can do amazing things over 26.2 miles.

While I can settle into a decent groove in a 10K, I feel like I’m in a true flow state or mindless rhythm in a half marathon. Sure, I’ve plunged deep into the Pain Cave around mile 8 or 9 in most of them – but slaying that mental demon at the bottom and clawing your way out has you feeling on top of the world for the last 5K or however much you have left in the race.

**Favorite (or most successful) training style/principles that you follow?**

Keep your easy days easy.

Successful training blocks are built one day and workout at a time. Likewise, a successful training block aren’t derailed by one bad day or workout. Learn from it and move on.

A lot of people like to focus on heart rate. I just run.

**Proudest Accomplishment?**

Running – Being resilient enough to not only bounce back from injury after injury after injury, but to hit huge PRs along the way. That was a 32:31 10K, 25:23 5-mile, as well as a 1:11:43 half marathon – which eventually dropped to 1:09:32 – after a severe hamstring pull in 2019. That was a 15:32 5K (now 15:23) and a 32:15 10K after a sacral stress fracture in 2020.

Not running – Being a role model for my nephew.

**Things you do outside of running?**

Other than work?

I mean, something must pay for the races and shoes.

Fitness is a MAJOR impetus for me, as you can see from the handle.

I try to hit the gym at least three times per week and have a daily yoga practice.

Got into cycling when I recovered from a sacral stress fracture and enjoyed that, too. Before, I’d just ride; but, as I built back from the injury, I’d try to mix in some workouts and developed a new appreciation for the sport. Running fitness doesn’t translate that well to cycling fitness. I will say that those workouts helped me bounce back from the injury better than ever before.

**Things that interest you outside of running?**

Improving myself by any means necessary and anything that comes along with it.

**Favorite subreddits?**

Is my mother going to read this!?

Just kidding.

I’m most active in r/advancedrunning and r/artc (for obvious reasons), dabble in r/triathlon (when I dip my toe into that sport), as well as r/mma and r/squaredcircle (because we all need our mindless entertainment from time to time).

**Origin of your username?**

It’s my Instagram handle, where I started chronicling my fitness &amp; running journey back in January of 2018. It only made sense to use it when I started posted in r/advancedrunning.

69,AdvancedRunning,booduz,2 Weeks Out - Is Sub-3 Possible?,"30M, 5ft9, 165lb with an original planned target goal of 3:05.

I'm running Chester Marathon on the 3rd October after coming to the end of Pfitz 12/55. I'd planned to follow the 18/55 plan but had been running around 35mpw prior to starting the plan and ran two trail races (a 20M with 3k feet of elevation and a 27m with 4k feet of elevation) so I opted for the shorter plan to take a few weeks to recover. I don't feel I've missed out too much by going for the shorter plan.

The training block has gone very well - I've only missed two runs from the schedule due to family commitments (an 11m medium-long run and a 4m recovery run). I've also hit or exceeded all of my target paces during speedwork and the MP long runs.

I ran a track 10K TT 2 weeks ago in 38:34 (Mile Splits: 6:20, 6:15, 6:18, 6:15, 5:59, 0.2@5:37). The last 1.2M suggests I might have had a bit more in the tank? Would like to think i'd break 38 minutes in an actual race.

Is sub-3 on the cards? I don't want to risk blowing up and missing my 3:05 goal but if sub-3 is a real possibility (especially with Chester being such a flat course) then I feel I should take the opportunity to go for it.",1631873142

79,AdvancedRunning,e7series,Postponing Berlin Marathon due to Achilles Issue,"I started the 18/55 Pfitz plan earlier this year to aim for a sub 3 in the Berlin Marathon in 10 days. About 2.5 weeks ago, I decided to sign up for a local half marathon race and did not properly warm up before hand. I ended up finishing the race in Marathon pace but I completely overdid it and now my achilles is paying the price. 

Since then, I've had all the normal symptoms of insertional achilles tendonitis - tight / slight pain when waking up in the morning, pain that goes away after warming up but never gets any better etc. Luckily there is no physical bump on my achilles. 

So for the last 2.5 weeks since the injury, I have been taking it slower and took off a lot of the key workouts left in the training plan. 

After reading a lot of the resources online and considering that I'm still fairly young at 32, I've decided to postpone the Berlin Marathon for 2022. Considering that my achilles is not getting better (nor worse), I want to fully rest for 6 to 8 weeks so I can be fully prepared for my next training cycle later this year. I do not want this to turn into a degenerative issue. 

During the rest time, I will be doing eccentric calf raises while also strengthening other areas of my body. 

I, of course, feel quite upset over the whole situation but I'm fortunate to have raced my personal best in the 5k (18m11s), 10k (38m04s), and HM (1h23m37s) during the training cycle.

* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Progressive Long Run**.

*History:*

From Lee Troop, three-time Olympian for Australia and holds a personal best of 2:09:49 for the distance. He now coaches some of the best runners in the United States, including Jake Riley, who placed second in the 2020 Olympic Trials marathon.

One of Troop’s key marathon-specific workouts is a progressive long run, done twice during the last two months before the race,   eight weeks out from their goal race, then again four weeks out. They use this workout to also practice their fluid and fuel intake: taking a water bottle every three miles.

*Why:*

One of Troop’s key marathon-specific workouts is a progressive long run, done twice during the last two months before the race.   They use this workout to also practice their fluid and fuel intake: taking a water bottle every three miles.

“It gives me a really good indication of what they’ll be able to hit [on race day],” Troop says. “If they hit it, we can go into the last couple weeks [of training] with a lot of confidence.”

*How:*

An 18-mile long run that starts off easy and gets faster every 3 miles. The last 6 miles are completed at goal marathon pace.

For example: If your goal marathon pace is 7:30 per mile, begin the run with 3 miles at an easy training pace. Then run miles 4-6 at 8:15 per mile, miles 7-9 at 8:00 per mile, miles 10-12 at 7:45 per mile, and the last 6 miles at your goal marathon pace of 7:30 per mile.

I in particular struggle quite badly in the heat, and with not getting enough water from drink stations and pushing too hard to stay with the 2nd woman ended up with heat exhaustion at mile 21.

Training week is normally: Monday rest, Tuesday interval, Wednesday recovery, Thursday rest, Friday Tempo run, Saturday easy 6-8 miles, Sunday long run of 1hr-2 hrs varied 

I've noticed my easy stuff is at least a minute per mile slower than guys I train with who are around 16:40-17:30 5k pace. These guys also do  twice as much mileage, and 3 speed sessions a week to my two (Tuesday interval and Friday Tempo) I've also notived guys who are a few min slower than me at 5k are able to keep up faster easy stuff

My normal weekly easy stuff is anywhere from 7:40-8:30 but most of the time it's all below 8. Usually 8:10s. My legs on easy days do feel generally quite tired. Which is strange for such relatively low mileage.

92,AdvancedRunning,SEMIrunner,How can a runner best recover from post-viral fatigue/Long COVID?,"Got sick with an unknown virus back in Feb/March 2020 and not been the same since. Might of gotten COVID and Long COVID, but never was tested initially and later tests never confirmed it. Was the worst sickness I've ever had, tho, where I had no fever but had trouble breathing for several weeks, followed by a roller-coaster that still doesn't seem to be quite done. It's clear at least, doctors say, that I've had  post-viral fatigue. It stinks, although I'm grateful for the health I currently have and talking with me you probably wouldn't realize what I've been through/going through. Still, I would appreciate any constructive advice in regards to running/health/life. My story (with apologies for length/thanks for your time):

I'm a man in my 40s. Before the illness, I was running 20-25 miles a week, getting ready to ramp up to 40 mpw as part of marathon training that spring. I also was swimming 2.5-3K a week (masters class) and riding a bike about an hour a week usually inside. Previous year I ran about a 320 and my pb is 249 from 20 years ago, around same time frame when I also did an Ironman (12 hrs). Have done close to 20 marathons overall, but not been as active the past 5-10 years because of family/career.

That summer was the toughest of the symptoms, where I had heart palpitations, dizziness, burning lungs and post-exertional malaise often whenever I tried to start back running again, even 1 mile only. Was able to walk, tho, a ton, which helped. Then I slowly added 30 minute bike rides and run-walking workouts, especially as standard heart/lung tests showed I was otherwise healthy outside these symptoms. I purposely had at least 1 day between any workout, because symptoms would return otherwise. In connecting with people suffering from long COVID and similar conditions on social media, I quickly found out less is more and that exercise can cause relapses.

Taking it slow and with doctor's approval, over the winter, I made more progress, eventually building up to 10-12 miles a week a few times, including an hour-long walk run and fairly successful 30-minute speed workouts. I even continued to bike 30-40 minutes once a week despite cold weather. But each time I'd invariably hit a wall where the symptoms would return, either from post-exercise or what appeared to be regular cold symptoms, which would waylay me sometimes for a week. Note, I tested for COVID a few times during this period but never positive.

Eventually, in the spring I got the COVID vaccine and that seemed to help with the recurring symptoms for a time but by summer as I tried to slowly build up again, I soon found out I had trouble running more than 30 minutes or more than 1 or 2 times a week. This is because when I do, I either find myself with more cold symptoms AND/OR my lungs burn, like a sore throat. What's maddening, too, is I often feel better after fitness before these symptoms descend and a few times I've experienced them at the same time. (One other win, tho, was returning to the pool and I've tried to fit in some swims lately, although it's sporadic).

Now some of my condition is probably from a loss of fitness. Throughout this time, my weight slowly increased to 25 pounds more than before my illness, peaking a few months ago, although I've now dropped about 10 from a better diet/fewer calories. Also, aside from my slower run times (now 1-2 minutes per mile slower on all runs), my estimated V02 max on my watch is 10 lower than it was previously but still great for my age.

So, here's the bottom line. Medically, I'm mostly considered healthy/recovered and there's not much doctors can do at the moment, which makes sense since they're busy and it's still a pandemic. And I'm happy not to be any worse off, because so many are who are currently battling this terrible disease AND who still suffer even far more debilitating symptoms from long COVID from early 2020.

Yet, in a way, I'm still injured and I haven't figured out how to treat it like a sore hamstring OR knee. Before there were times in my life where I got out of shape but I always could run a fair distance, as long as it was slow enough. I could endure the pain and the fatigue and never be out of breath. Now, I don't know how to handle sore lungs. No one seems to know.

And while I can accept I may never be the masters runner or athlete I was -- I've long abandoned my 20s/early 30s self for good reason -- I do not want to give up trying to be active or have running goals, especially now as I have genuine concern for my long-term health and still see fitness as a key to lots of positive things. (I often wonder now if many longtime runners quit after something like this where their joints didn't wear out but their overall health/lungs did).

Can anyone relate? Any sports med docs out there with thoughts? What's the best path forward for someone like me?",1631678434
93,AdvancedRunning,Forsaken-Stomach4093,Race Pace Help!!,"Getting into crunch time for Chicago which is in \~3weeks. This means it's time for me to start scrambling to figure out a good race pace target after hot summer sessions in the South.

I was introduced to the wild world of summer marathon training for Chicago 2019. Brutal Mississippi summer heat and humidity had beat me down to a point I had zero confidence going into the race.... low and behold the marathon featured my ideal weather of low 40s F, and I put in a PR at a pace 40sec faster than my average pace throughout June-Sept training. 

Fast forward to 2021. I have my eyes on making a big PR this go around. I have felt extremely good during this training block. I am consistently putting in more work, especially structured interval work, and I am averaging around 32sec faster a mile over more and longer runs in the same period as my 2019 campaign. 

With how things went in 2019, I am trying to figure out what kind of race pace to target this go around. It is so hard for me to wrap my head around it all because my long runs in MS are done in 90 degree weather with high humidity and no wind and hopefully Chicago will be on the chillier side again.

### Training

I'm going to save the pandemic story for the Chicago race report, but in short I'm currently on Pfitz 18 week 85 mpw plan with the goal of going
02:50 in Chicago next month. Why do I think 2:50 is possible? Because two months ago I ran a comfortable 17:41 5k TT. However, it's been a mental suckfest since.

For the month of August, I had a couple rough weeks where runs were slow and I had to take a couple days off to deal with a cranky soleus.
But I've always had issues with the middle of Pfitz's plans, so I kept telling myself that things would start getting better as we approached
the final weeks before taper. I still hit over 90% of the mileage, but I didn't survive two threshold workouts, which put me in a bad headspace.

Two weeks ago I had my first tune-up race at the Santa Rosa 10k, where I had high expectations of a good outing. Unfortunately,
I blew up after two miles and didn't PR. The week after I had a decent 90 mile week, but couldn't hold marathon pace in a 20 mile long. So heading into
this race, I wasn't feeling great.

### Pre-race

Flew in to LA the day before, napped all day in the hotel room, then went on a recovery run and had an early dinner. In bed by 10PM, up at 4:30AM.
Coffee, shit, eat, shit some more, then I was off to the start line at 6AM. Checked in my gear, warmed up, into the front of the chute.

It was a very cool experience because of 9/11; firefighters, EMTs, police, veterans,
families, friends, were all out to support. The fire department hung a giant American flag above the start line from a fire engine ladder, there was a moment of
silence. And the anthem sent chills down my spine.

### Race

Gun goes off and planes in a v-formation flew over us with red, white, and blue smoke. Temperature is 65 degrees. Plan was to keep 5k splits
between 19:25 and 19:55, roughly 6:15-6:25 / mile. I knew that my goal marathon equivalent wasn't possible that day, but I liked the idea of
aiming for a PR along with a wide target range.

First 5k followed up pacific coast highway, very flat, very comfortable but also zero shade to hide from the giant hydrogen bomb raging in the sky.

**5k split - 19:36 - 6:19/mi**

The second 5k heads east into a neighborhood with a small bit of climbing before winding around a block and heading back onto the highway. I didn't
do great on the hills cause my legs are fatigued, but managed to stay within the goal range.

**10k split - 19:55 - 6:25/mi**

We turn back on the highway and my heart rate begins to rapidly climb, eventually past threshold. Temperatures are now well into the 70s
and I'm fully exposed. I hold on as long as I could to 6:29, one second faster than my PR pace, while my heart rate bounced off threshold BPM.
With a km left in the split, my HR can't stay below threshold any longer and I slow down even more.

**15k split - 20:15 - 6:31/mi**

I knew I still had a shot at a PR, until mile 11 when a tiny fucking hill took everything out of me. After the hill, I went full survival mode,
under no circumstances did I want to fail to break 1:30. The last couple miles of the race I was fighting to stay under 7:00/mi, my heart rate well above threshold at this point.

**20k split - 21:25 - 6:54/mi**

About half a mile before the finish line, the course split. Half marathoners went straight to the finish line, but the full marathoners were routed back because they were only
at mile 16. So if you ran the marathon, you'd see the finish line literally half a mile away before you turned back up the road for another 10 miles. For some reason, that
made me feel a bit better and I was able to come home strong.

**21.1k split - 6:47/mi**

### Post-race

I felt fine. I checked the weather and it was 79F/24C. Lot of friends ran positive splits, very few PRs that day. The next day I was able to comfortably run an 18 mile long,
which told me I hadn't raced to my full potential. I doubt there was anything I could have done differently, I don't train in a hot environment nor am I training for a
particularly warm race. Surf City was forced to move to September this year, so I hope this doesn't turn anyone off from running it since it's normally a winter race.

On a positive note, I got valuable experience in dealing with a runaway heart rate in a race. Up until this race, all my previous blow-ups were due to muscle fatigue.
I was able to trust my training to ensure I finish the race strong.

I'm still seeking that elusive validation that a 2:50 is possible for me, and my last shot will be in two weeks at my last tune-up race, a flat 10k. Fortunately, that race is
during a taper week, so I'm keeping positive thoughts!

### Conclusions

As someone who used to never do tune-up races, I'd like to encourage everyone to do them throughout your season. The experience is invaluable, and you learn how to deal with all
sorts of mishaps. Lastly, thank you to the community and the mods.",1631661637
96,AdvancedRunning,WusiSniper_,Transition from road running to XC running,"Hey all,

I am looking to get into XC running/racing and I'm wondering what would be the best method to working my way up to using XC spikes. Currently I only run on roads and trails so I've never ran in spikes before. It sounds like it can wreck your calves pretty good the first go around. Do XC runners normally train in road shoes on cross country courses before the season?

I (22M) have a little over two years of consistent running experience including with a handful of road races 5k to half marathon distance. Also I am currently averaging around 35-40 mpw.

So... I ran very seriously in high school, but got a chronic case of shin splints that put me out for 2+ years. I was able to start running again about 12 weeks ago, from doing a lot of PT and changing my form, but 8 weeks ago I got injured again (pain in my hip flexor/groin). I've always been very injury prone and that has constantly hindered my performance, as well as just not letting me run. I've worked with various PT/Physios to varying degrees of success. But recently I've been running on my current injury (just running enough to not be in too much pain, like 10-15 mpw), and just realizing how clunky my form feels. Overall I just do not feel smooth or efficient, like how most highly talented runners look. 

I've tried running specific weightlifting (I followed *Running Rewired* for a while*)*, core exercises, flexibility exercises, foam rolling, glute activation, etc etc etc. Its not that these things haven't helped me, but I would like to do these things from a unified, focused perspective, not just doing various exercises/plans on my own.

Basically, I'm looking for online personalized coaching/personal training to rebuild and remodel my body, from someone very experienced with working with runners like me. Does this exist? I know there are many, many personal trainers on the internet, so I figured this must exist for runners specifically.

98,AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Quality long runs in marathon training,"I just watched a sweat elite workout video of Ian Butler (2:09 marathoner) and it was really cool to hear him talk about training philosophy on stuff like doing workouts by feel, but at the end he talked about the long run and said something that kind of surprised me:

&gt;The weekly miles take care of the endurance, but you need the speed workouts to tune it up. I'm not a big long run guy, I really struggle on them....I'm definitely not one to push the pace ever on the long run. There's a lot of benefits to it of course but I'd rather be fresh for these (workouts) than tire myself out on the long run. I picture a long run being just running long on tired legs, that's it...I get my legs tired throughout the week, and then I go out and do 2:20 on them on sunday.

Being someone who also really struggles with (and hates lol) fast long runs but likes workouts, that sounds great. I find I can bounce back from a workout after 1-2 easy days but those hard long runs are more like 3-4 and I feel like total garbage for the first 2. But I am wondering how applicable that strategy is to someone like me running 50mpw which is probably under half what he runs, because it seems most marathon plans include at least some marathon pace tempos or speedwork in some of the long runs. Jack daniels 2Q for example is almost like two long runs a week with many of them being quite challenging.

So how important are those fast long runs to us average joes? Are they necessary to go the distance without bonking or mentally cracking, or can modest mileage with two workouts a week and a long run done by feel get you strong enough to do alright? Is it a personal thing, and what can you do to maximize your chances of running well with this approach?",1631646803

101,AdvancedRunning,MotivicRunner,A Comparison of Running Economy Across Seven Carbon-Plated Racing Shoes,"**Please note that this is a** ***preprint*** **-- it has not yet been peer reviewed. Even though as a layperson it looks to me like this was a well-conducted study, treat these results as preliminary until this paper is actually published in a scientific journal.**

I believe [this preprint from Dr. Dustin Joubert of Stephen F. Austin University](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/kinesiology/33/) is the first controlled lab study that compares many of the carbon-plated racing shoe options currently available (Asics Metaspeed Sky, Brooks Hyperion Elite 2, Hoka Rocket X, New Balance RC Elite 1, Nike Alphafly, Nike Vaporfly Next% 2, and Saucony Endorphin Pro 1)  against each other and against a contemporary traditional racing flat (Asics Hyperspeed). 

He worked with 12 well-trained male runners (in \~15:30-17:30 5km shape or equivalent at the time of the study) and measured running economy, as well as some other measurements associated with running mechanics, at a speed of 16km/hr (i.e. 3:45/km or 6:02/mi).

The entire preprint is worth reading for anyone interested in the intersection of shoe tech and exercise science. Here are some of my initial thoughts/takeaways from reading through it.

* The Vaporfly and Alphafly are still the gold standard for super shoes (average running economy improvement of 3% and 2.7%, respectively), but the Metaspeed Sky is also very competitive as well (average running economy improvement of 2.5%). All three of these average improvements over the traditional flat were statistically significant. Assuming I read the graph in Figure 2 correctly, it even seems like the Metaspeed Sky actually provided the most improvement for some individuals.
* Brooks and Hoka have their work cut out for them to improve the Hyperion Elite 2 and Rocket X to a level that is competitive with the best carbon-plated racers currently on the market. On average those shoes did not provide a statistically significant improvement in running economy over the traditional flat. That's especially painful considering the huge gap in price between the Hyperspeed ($90) and those shoes (Hyperion Elite 2 @ $250, Rocket X @ $180).
* Building on the previous thought, this study seems to reinforce that a super foam (e.g. PEBA) working in tandem with a carbon-fiber element -- not just a carbon-fiber element in and of itself -- is what make super shoes ""super."" Hoka in particular seems to be very stuck with traditional variations on EVA, so at this point I personally don't think the Carbon X or Rocket X can be classified as true super shoes.
* I'd like to see some more discussion about the individual variation in response to the various shoes. The graph in Figure 2 shows that to an extent, but it is hard to read for that purpose since it was created to highlight the group average trend.
* Most likely due to limited availability, the study didn't include the Adios Pro (either V1 or V2). In my mind that would have been one of the most interesting comparisons, since at the elite level Adidas is the main competitor to Nike. I hope future research can be done that includes the Adios Pro.
* I want to see this study repeated with female runners. Since women are not small men, there could be important differences in how women respond to the various carbon-plated racers. Even if there isn't a difference, having more evidence that, when combined with this study, better reflects the entire population of runners is a good thing.
* I'm looking forward to one of the [current projects that Dr. Joubert is working on](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTlGvvdAQGg/), which will investigate the effects of super shoes on running economy at paces slower than 14km/hr (i.e. 4:17/km or 6:54/mi).",1631638108

So I have half marathon race coming up on 17th October and this last week I’ve come down with a nasty cold and cough. Tried a few runs but my HR was sky high and didn’t feel up to it. Im likely to miss the remainder of this week til I’m fit to start training again. 

I’ve been building from 40 to 70 miles over the last 16 weeks. My plan was to hold 70 miles a week for the next 3 weeks and then taper for the last 2 but this cold has got in the way of last week which was supposed to end on 67 miles but instead ended at 53 and is now chewing into my first 70 mile week. 

So my question is how do I approach the next few weeks? Do I continue when I feel fit and get two 70 mile weeks in and taper as planned, do I shorten my taper from two weeks to 9-10 days and try to make up some more miles or will there not be much benefit from this? 

Set a 10 mile PR at 6:11/mi @ 1:02 last week so I was confidently aiming for 1:22 / 1:23. Will a week off at this point in training mean I need to reassess my goal?

I (M23) played soccer in college and have been running after graduating as a way to stay in shape. I ran \~40 miles per week from January 2020 to May 2020 in preparation for a fall marathon. When the marathon went virtual, I lost a lot of motivation and my mileage dropped to 20-30 miles per week through the summer and fall. I ended up running 1:34 for a half marathon in June and 3:46 for a fall marathon (though that includes several breaks to chat with friends and family along the way).

In January 2021, I built up to \~50 miles per week and coasted around there until late spring. I started the Pfitz 18/70 plan with a goal marathon scheduled for October 10th. The plan has gone pretty well so far, with a few down weeks for a couple of mid-summer vacations. I made sure to hit all of the key workouts and have run almost all of the scheduled miles.

My dad ran a 3:08 marathon in his early 30s and qualified for Boston. I've wanted to beat his time for a while now and I'm hoping that this is the cycle that will get me there. My main goal is to go sub 3 for this marathon and it would be icing on the cake to be able to run Boston in the spring. I wanted to hit 1:25 in this race before attempting to go sub 3 in October.

## Pre-race

My girlfriend and I drove to a neighboring town and spent the night about 15 minutes from the starting point. I ran a pretty high mileage week the week prior and my legs were still a little heavy. I put them up for 20 minutes to help freshen them up before hitting the hay. 

As it was a smaller event, we picked up our bibs and goodie bags the morning of the race. I woke up around 5:15, ate my customary pre-race meal of 2 pieces of bread with heaping scoops of raspberry jam, used the bathroom, and was out the door by 5:50. The half started at 8:00, but we had to be there to pick up our stuff by 6:30 so that the marathoners could start at 7:00. 

The national anthem played, the marathoners took off, and we boarded the shuttle to get to the starting point for the half. Once we got to the start line, we still had about 35 minutes to use the bathroom and warm up before the race started. I went to the bathroom again, did some stretches, put on my race shoes, ran a couple strides, then felt pretty ready to go.

## Race

When the horn went off, I took off in the lead flying down the bike path. I don't wear carbon fiber shoes very often and the adrenaline got the best of me. After about a minute, I looked down at my watch and saw that I was running 5:40 pace and immediately took my foot off of the gas. Although my plan was to shoot for 6:30s to start, I settled into 6:15ish pace, which felt pretty comfortable.

There was a hairpin turn 0.9 miles into the course before the course went back into town. I noticed that I had opened up a 30 second lead on the guy in second place. I passed the rest of the runners and exchanged some encouraging words. Miles 1-3.5 were pretty darn flat and seemed to just tick by. At around the 4-mile mark, the bike path went slightly uphill. This change in elevation was accompanied by a shift from smooth pavement to hard, slightly damp moss. The whole course was on a bike path that was usually paved but had several stretches of semi-loose gravel, moss, and grass. My shoes ended up holding their grip fairly well and the elevation didn't slow me down as much as I initially thought it would.

At the end of mile 6, I crested the hill and the course went through an old train tunnel. On the other side of the tunnel was a lovely gradual downhill. By this point in the race, I convinced myself that I could probably maintain 6:15-6:20 pace, so I should adjust my initial plan and go for it. At an aid station around mile 8.5, I squeezed 3/4 of a chocolate GU into my mouth and managed to get a couple of ounces of water to wash it down. I haven't practiced drinking out of cups while running and I quickly discovered that I'm not naturally gifted at it. 

I did some tired mental math at mile 10 and figured I could finish in 1:23:XX if I could keep my pace, with an outside chance of going sub 1:23. Miles 11 and 12 were much less shaded than the trail and I could feel the sun getting stronger by the minute. I was trying to focus on my cadence, but I could tell that I had lost the spring in my step that I had an hour prior. I mustered up some energy for the last mile because I realized that I was really close to breaking 1:23. I saw the finish line from about 200m away and kicked hard. I crossed the finish line and saw that I ran 1:23:06!

## Post-race

The race organizer came over to congratulate me on winning and asked that I stick around for the awards ceremony. I got my ticket for an apple dumping (tasted just as good as it sounds) and chatted with some of the locals. I was really happy to win my first race and come home with a cool gold medal.

I'm really happy with the time, especially given the conditions. The weather was fairly warm, so it's a confidence booster knowing that it will hopefully be a little cooler in a month. I'm planning to start at 6:45 pace for the marathon, assuming good conditions. Fingers crossed this is a good sign for sub 3!

110,AdvancedRunning,Nayaa03,Is Running Not for Me?,"I am a senior in HS. I’ve gone into my story in detail so I’m just going to be quick about it now. I’ve had 3 stress fractures, 1 on my lower left back and 2 on my right fibula. I’ve also had 2 surgeries that were unrelated to running but set me back in my fitness. I’ve also had 2 ankle sprains, and multiple stress reactions in my feet. I have also dealt with plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis. All of these injuries I have dealt with in the past three years. I’ve been to so many physical therapy sessions for each injury as well as many different doctors, but I can’t seem to get a break from these injuries. I missed my entire freshman year, and was finally able to run my sophomore year. I had a pretty good sophomore year when it came to running. I had a 18:52 5k, 10:58 3200m, and 5:05 mile, and these times were all achieved during cross country and winter track. I missed my sophomore spring track season due to an emergency surgery, and I ran only a couple races during my junior year and was a lot slower since I was running through injury. During the summer of my junior year going into senior year I got a second stress fracture on my fibula. I just recently recovered from that stress fracture and after weeks of PT I was cleared to run again. Last week I had my first race in cross country which was a 4K. I ran such a slow time, even during recovery days I run faster then what I ran. Also, after the run my fibula, which I had two stress fractures on, STILL hurts. Now I’m just so disappointed and I honestly just want to quit. I don’t know what it is with me, I’ve gotten my running form analyzed, I’ve even been to a chiropractor. I just can’t seem to get a break from injury and it’s honestly making me hate running.",1631586944

### TL;DR
Did my first 100km. Asked this sub if I was capable of ludicrously fast times. [Was informed I would not be](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/pjy5dh/100km_ultramarathon_choosing_a_goal_time/). Revised goals down but they were still far too ambitious. Faded very badly and at the 3/4 point had a genuine crisis of the soul. Rallied just enough to get to the finish. Learned a lot about myself as a runner and a person. Deeply humbled by the experience, but also grateful for it.

### Training
M34 who took up running in 2018 to lose weight. I did my first marathon in 2019. In 2020 I had a breakthrough year and hit a lot of PBs including two sub-3 marathons, sub-37 10K and a sub-18 5K. For a long time I had felt fat and unathletic and I really came to love running; it gave me a feeling of achievement and pride in my body. As I would come to discover, I had become maybe too dependent on this feeling of progress. 

Unfortunately I picked up a case of plantar fasciitis in autumn 2020 which disrupted my training until April this year. During lockdown I decided that when I could go outside again, I would spend as much time in nature and the outdoors as possible. What better way than trail ultras.
 
I built back to weekly mileage of 80-90km with peaks of 100+. I ran a couple of flat 50Ks in June and a c. 75km trail race with 1500m elevation in July. The goal with these had been to finish strong but with an eye to further training. Thames Path would be my first 100km but also my A race for the autumn, and given it was a very flat route, and I was used to planning and executing races well, I was feeling ambitious and decided to go for sub-10hrs.
 
My last 5 weeks of training. Weekly totals plus highlights:

* 97km (including the 75km race in c. 8h 20m. I aggravated an ankle problem so started doing some recovery runs on elliptical to take pressure off it)
* 30km (+ 1hr elliptical) - recovery week
* 95km (+ 30 mins elliptical), including a fast HM B race (1:27)
* 106km (+ 2hrs elliptical), finished the week with a marathon in 3:40, most of it at sub 5:00/km pace with some warm up and cool down miles.
* last week: 78km (start of taper)

### Pre-race
I readied my kit and drop bag contents the night before using an extensive pre-race routine written on my phone. I refine and improve the routine every time I race and find it helpful for staying organised. I will add a comment with my kit list if helpful 

**Shoes:** I used a pair of Hoka One One Clifton 7s which I had already done one training marathon in. In training, I run with a pair of insoles to relieve pressure on my plantar fascia and posterior tibial tendon. Over shorter races I use [Algeos rear-foot wedges](https://www.algeos.com/arch_adjusted_rearfoot_wedge.html) to help control my foot from rolling inward but without the weight of a heavy plastic insole. I had agonised over whether to use these for this ultra, thinking the less weight the better over long distances. Eventually I decided not to risk my tendons for the sake of a few grams, and go with the plastic insole. I think it was the right call.

**Vest:** I ran with a cheap [Aoinijie 18L vest](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08C5K6L68/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) which I think is excellent for the price, plus 2 x 600ml bottles with straws from the same brand (I find camelbacks too heavy and difficult to refill). 
 
I spent the preceding two days carb loading by eating more bread and rice and avoiding fats. I got to bed at 11pm and slept soundly. The alarm went off at 4:30am for a 6:50 race start. I ate a breakfast of a cereal bar and porridge. I drank two coffees to stimulate a movement, which I thought worked (in hindsight this was a mistake...)

I knew that the chafing, blistering and gut problems that might irritate me in a marathon could blow up into race-ending issues over longer distances. So I used a lot of vaseline in every crevice and threw a fair amount of 2Toms Blistershield powder in my socks and back up socks (although I had to empty some out as it made little lumps in them). I took a pre-emptive immodium and stored more in my vest for the halfway point. I wore knee high compression socks with another pair of shin compression gear over the top of those. And although it would be a cloudy day in England, I still threw factor 50 sunblock on, just in case. 

I took a cab to the start line which cost a fortune but I wasn't about to walk to the bus given the amount of time I would be on my feet that day. The race set off from a small park in West London next to the Thames. The event was mainly for walkers but it also catered to runners who had an early start time. The weather was cool and clear in the morning, and the day was set to be cloudy albeit a little hotter than normal.

### Strategy
 
My hydration strategy was to drink one of my 600ml bottles between aid stations which were spaced every 10 to 14km. 
 
My nutrition strategy was to get 250 calories an hour from a combination of solid food at checkpoints with a Gu gel in between; I knew from experience that a diet of 100% gels would destroy my insides after 50km, but with plenty of immodium and a mix of foods, I would be ok. I had some old SIS gels I brought with me just in case I needed something isotonic (to combat dehydration) or caffeine free to give my guts a rest. My parents very kindly followed me in their car between checkpoints throughout the day to provide support, and they also carried a bag of Tailwind. I threw a couple of scoops into one of the 600ml bottles for an easy source of carbs and electrolytes, and to provide another option in case my GI tract began to rebel. 

### Race

**0 - 25km**
The race was very well organised with an easy check in and bag drop, and we started bang on time. I settled into a comfortable rhythm at around 5:45/km, firmly on 10 hour pace, as we began to move west from the centre of town towards the sights of West London (Kew Gardens and Hampton Court Palace). I said hello to and chatted with a few competitors and told them my target time, which I would begin to regret later in the race. One runner kept overtaking me, but I would pass him when he took walking breaks; he told me this was because he had a sensitive gut and walking made it easier to digest. I would be taking this advice myself later in the day. 

Unfortunately I managed to miss a turning early on and cut around 500m of the course. Wrong turns later in the day would more than make up for this distance but it was a bad early omen. The path occasionlly turned away from the river and wound back and forth between the north and south banks of the Thames. More than once I would have to ask passers by if they had seen route markers up ahead. I twice had to call out to another runner ahead of me that he had missed a turn and was off course.

Aid stations had plenty of chocolate, bananas and energy drinks which I stocked up on at every chance. I remembered reading, ""An ultramarathon is an eating competition with running thrown in"" on this sub and was determined not to let this do me in.

The Thames Path runs through towns, villages and near empty countryside, much of it flat and green. In the morning we passed many rowers training, and later in the day there were families playing and picnicking by the water, and after lunch a few merry bands enjoying drinks on boats. There was the occasional turn onto dual carriageways or through uninspiring architecture, but for the most part it was a really lovely tour. The organisers had marked every kilometre and as the event progressed, passers by, walkers and other runners on the path offered plenty of encouragement which was so great to receive.

At 23km, my guts began to unexpectedly grumble, and I realised I might not make the aid station. A wise man once said, ""Eat before you are hungry, drink before you are thirsty, and shit before you shit yourself."" I had to take an unfortunate trip to a bush and while I had packed toilet roll it was a really bad sign. I took another immodium earlier than planned and hoped it would get things under control.

**25 - 50km**

I left the 25km feeling ok but at 30km I began to realise fatigue was setting in earlier than I had expected. I wasn't sure if this was normal tiredness, or the start of a breakdown. My heart rate still seemed under control, so I decided to take the high risk approach and keep pushing at this pace. 


I passed the marathon split in around 4:05 and the 50k in around 4:50. However, I had to admit to myself at the 50km point that things were not going well. At that checkpoint I admitted to my parents that I was probably going to reach the next checkpoints later than planned. 

At 50km I changed my hat but elected not to change any other clothes or shoes (it didn't seem to make a difference to me). I did reapply sunscreen. I also had to make another toilet stop and noticed GI discomfort starting to creep in. At this point I was still rushing through the aid stations, as much out of frustration as anything else as I knew even sub-11 would be challenging.

**50 - 75km**

I left the aid station and after a few token miles trying to keep my splits to 6:00/km (around 10:30 pace) they slipped easily to around 6:30/km. At this point I was in around 8th place. By this point the sun had came out and the day felt much hotter and more humid than we had expected. I began running with a women and an aid station volunteer told her she was the female race lead, and we were currently in the top 15. We were both surprised that the field was so slow today - previous years had been much faster - and we mused on what the reason might be.
 
By this point I had come to recognise one or two other runners and I recall complaining to them about nausea. Solid food was not going down as easily and the list of things I could eat was dwindling (it would soon reach zero). I went from eating chocolate and bananas at aid stations to drinking energy drinks and 50/50 coke and water mix.

I made it to the 3/4 point still technically on sub-11hr pace, but by this time I had to accept that I was really struggling and barely able to run. I had to apply a pre-emptive blister plaster to my heel, where my sock had worn through, but that was the least of my worries. 
 
I found myself very nauseous and unable to eat anything solid. My mother ignored the rules telling spectators to stay out of the rest areas and came to tell me I looked really ill. She had never understood why I did this sport. ""It's fine, this is normal"", I said, but I didn't believe it myself. She suggested I give up if I had to, that if I continued I only walk, and that if I needed to drop out between rest areas they could pick me up. It came from a place of love but it was very difficult to hear. I took another toilet break before I left - I had taken three immodium tabs by this point and didn't want to take more for fear of doing myself damage, but still my GI tract was rebelling. 

**75 - 100km**

I left the 75K check point in a state of dread. At this point I could barely run at 8:00/km. Before this day, I would not have believed it was possible to go this slowly and still technically be running. My gait was a strange shuffle; I felt like an 80 year-old version of myself. 

At 80km, I realised that I had blown up so badly, I might have to walk the next 25km to reach the finish. If you blow up in a marathon and have to jog in the final four miles, that's bad. But if you have to jog in the last quarter of an ultramarathon, you might be walking for four hours. That's a long time to be left licking one's wounds. 

Worse, I was struggling to take in even water without waves of nausea, let alone carbs. Could I even keep my body going for four hours without more food and calories? It would be worse than a waste to keep going at a snail's pace for two more hours, just to hit a total wall or collapse at 90K and to have to DNF anyway. 

I began to suffer a bit of a mental crisis and became quite emotional. I realised that almost every time I had tried something new in running it had gone well; even when I failed to hit a target, I would PB. This was the first time I was facing dreaded, abject, public failure. I would have to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I had failed to finish the thing I had been talking about for weeks. I realised that I had come to depend on running to make me feel strong and succesful and worthy in the eyes of others who had praised my sudden turn from fat guy to amateur endurance athlete. And here I was discovering that I was the same weak person, who struggled in every domain of life; relationships, careers, everything. I was still full of fear and doubt and I didn't even have my mediocre amateur physical achievements to cover up for it.

I had phone signal and decided to call my partner. I voiced many of these fears to her and will admit that there were a few tears. She gave me a pep talk and after ten mins of chatting I began to feel better.

Things that helped in this moment:

* An article I read here or an /r/artc about how to recover from ""bonking"" (which means something *very* different here in the UK, but anyway). I can't find it now but it contained a sentence along the lines of, ""In the worst depths of this crisis, you must have faith that you can recover. You will feel ok again and finish, and maybe even finish strong."" I knew my issues went beyond nutrition - my muscles had stopped working - but I trusted the author, an experienced professional, that if I kept going, things might improve.
* Having a new goal. No I wouldn't hit my time goals, but ""Don't DNF"" became a goal worth suffering for.
* Focussing on the positives. I shared some of my woes with an aid station volunteer, who said in passing: ""Of all the routes in the world to be stuck walking, this is a good one."" And he was right. It wasn't no longer that hot as late afternoon passed into evening. Children were playing by the river. Cows congregated in fields. Deer wandered on country estates. People on boats waved to us on the river bank. Bits of historic England popped up every few minutes. It was a nice place to be.
* I thought about Yuki Kawauchi at the Boston Marathon in 2018. Many elites dropped out in torrential rain but he kept going because he shows up to and finishes every race, and because of that he won a major title. As long as you keep showing up, you never know what might happen. I thought of a few other greats and let their examples inspire me.

Incredibly, as I kept going, things got better. My legs were restored to the point where I could coax a few mins of 7:30/km pace running out of them, followed by a couple of minutes walking. That doesn't seem like much but my watch told me it would be enough to get me a sub-12 result which would be the cherry on top of finishing. And while I was passed a few times between 80 and 90km, from 90km I didn't see anyone coming up behind me; the closer I got to the finish, the more likely it would become that I would get a result in the top 20, which became an additional incentive to keep going.

### Post-race
At 5km I was just about able to sustain a gentle trot. I crossed the finish before it got dark and hugged my parents. I was very quickly overcome with a case of the shakes and coldness. I wrapped up warm and drank hot, sugary tea. I failed to stretch or really do anything except clamber in the car and sleep on the way home; I would not recommend this.

### What I learned

* Most importantly, I learned my limits as a person. In the depths of my crisis at 75K, I realised I had pushed so hard at the start of the race because I needed this result to be special, to make up for other perceived failings in my life. In that moment by the riverbank by myself, my legs were gone and I couldn't run at all. I had nothing left but failure, and I was faced with the fact that I am riddled with weakness. And it was fine. I learned to accept that about myself and be at peace. The next time I go for a run or enter a race I will still be ambitious and excited about what I can achieve, but I don't think I will be doing it to feed my fragile pride. Maybe I can do it with greater modesty, humility and ultimately a greater sense of joy.
* I understand now what my different levels of exhaustion are. I know that if I feel a certain way at 30km it's time to slow down. 
* I also learned that time works differently in an ultra. A few extra mins of walking here and there, or a few mins extra at an aid station getting ready for the next leg (applying lubricant, taking care of blisters, digesting, catching up with supporters, etc), can make you much faster in the long run.
* I learned a lot about the limits of my GI tract. No caffeine except maybe in the final couple of hours of a longer race. I sabotaged myself badly by drinking coffee and using caffeinated gels. For me, it's fine in a three hour marathon. Anything longer and it's just laying dynamite which will blow up later.

### What's next
An easy week off to let tendons recover with maybe a few slow miles here and there. I am tempted to train for shorter distances (5, 10 and half marathons) before taking a run at Boston, assuming my qualifier from last year gets me in once I have graduated into the next age bracket.

### Final words
Thank you to the running community on this sub and beyond for all the inspiration and learning. You tried to warn me but I had to learn this lesson the hard way. Although I feel humbled and a little bit sad I didn't post a better time, I think this experience has made me a wiser runner and person in the long run.

### Training
I followed Pfitzinger 12/47, moved around a few workouts but otherwise followed it to a T. I raced my first 10K as one of my prescribed tune-up races in 42:25, which left me feeling confident. Last year I raced my first marathon in 3:32. I want to run a marathon in 3:10 which would qualify me for Chicago on time. Another marathon was not in the cards for me this year, for a variety of reasons. I viewed this race as a stepping stone towards that goal in the future, possibly next year. This was my first half marathon, so my biggest concern going into the race was getting my pace right. 

### Pre-race
Pretty standard. The night before I went out for a pasta dinner, did yoga, then went to bed. Slept pretty good. Morning of the race I had a cup of coffee, a banana, and some Tailwind. Ran a 3/4 mile warmup jog. 

### Race
I definitely went out faster than I intended to, but luckily it wasn’t stupidly fast. I felt really good like I was comfortably cruising at a slightly quick pace. I knew the course had a big uphill from roughly 5-8 and was pleasantly surprised with how I did through that stretch. I rode the downhill through mile 9… and then started to have some trouble. You can see I definitely struggled through the final couple miles, but nothing too damaging to my overall performance. I felt like I crushed my true goal time of 1:35 and finished 12th overall / 3rd in my age group. 

### Post-race
Really happy with my performance! My real goal was 7:15, I just slapped 7:00 down as a stretch goal. Being so close at 7:01 was a great shock, I really did not think that was in the realm of possibility. I am hoping to continue on my two-part running goals of running sub-3 in the Chicago marathon (and qualifying for it on time first). My wife is due with our second child this month, so my racing is likely done for the year, but it was a great note to end on until 2022!

I suck at recovering from these strains. I feel like this is a weird thing to be bad at. Your body just heals itself -- right? But seriously, I'm terrible.

It usually takes me a month (sometimes more) to get back to where I was after a minor strain. I follow all of the standard advice, e.g.

* RICE the first 48 hours
* avoid stretching the area
* roll adjacent areas
* prioritize sleep
* see a running-specific PT
* take a couple weeks off
* etc

but _every_ time without exception I end up with lingering pain that has me second guessing whether it's safe to get back. ""What if it's not done healing? I don't want to rip the scar tissue and make it worse. I guess I'll just take another week off.""

I've followed ""return to running"" programs in the past, but those are geared toward grade 2+ strains and more serious injuries. It shouldn't take 4+ weeks of alternating running/walking to get back to running full time after a minor strain.

Berlin will be my first marathon, and I had hoped to go for 3:10-3:25. A pretty wide range, but I’m just trying to not put too much pressure on myself. With Berlin only two weeks away, and the most important week of work I’ll have all year (this past week) in the rear view, I find myself in a peculiar spot.  
I was going to do most of this weeks mileage from Thursday-Sunday, so I did a light and easy 3.4 miles on Thursday. Then for Friday my bosses came into town and we all played ultimate frisbee for pt. I have no recollection of this, as I apparently collided with someone during the game.  I’m told I was “conscious and aware and moving around” for the rest of the game, and even driving 20 minutes of the ride back to my apartment.

I was hoping to gain some insight from the community about whether people believe it's a good idea or even doable to run a sub-3 marathon with a hydration pack on.

I've got my marathon in just over 4 weeks and as it's been so warm throughout the past 12 weeks that I've been training, I've been using a hydration vest on (Inov8 vest with 2 x 500 mL soft flask with tubes attached) to keep my fluids up. I was aware this might hamper me slightly during training but nonetheless I've been able to do my training plan and the big session fairly well and I've been running my target marathon pace (~4:10 min/km) with the vest and water in tow. The other advantage is that the pack lets me carry my gels for the runs too (which I want to be able to do in the marathon).

I guess my question is has anyone run a sub-3 marathon carrying this type of load and if so would you recommend it? Or is it worth running as light as possible and just grabbing water at the water stations during the race?

During most of my longer, hotter runs I've been getting through all the water I'm carrying which makes me concerned that I'd need that on race day but I'm also aware that I'm probably making my life a lot harder.

I currently feel like I'm a bottomless pit and go through periods where I'm completely ravenous. I've definitely pigged out in the past and it didn't bother me, but lately it really is. I just have a fear of gaining weight and getting slower, yet I keep eating. I wish I was at home and not at this all you can eat dining hall that either has salads or unhealthy (but delicious) crap. I have no self control and it irritates me to no end. Even if I close my eyes as I walk by the desserts I just end up feasting when I get back to my dorm on the snacks my mom sent me with. I have to force myself to go to the library but all I think about is food. It's not always like this, though - this week I've been especially hungry, but it was because I restricted for 3 days following a terrible race. See, restricting food is my coping mechanism, and I'd like to change that. I wish I could just eat intuitively again and not have food occupy so much brain space.

I've always compared myself to others. Why are my legs so bulky, is that why I'm slow? I've noticed that the thinner runners are often not bothered by the heat, yet I have so much trouble moving myself along. Some girls talk about how others make fun of them for being too skinny and how they've tried all their life to gain weight and I want to to cry because I would give anything to be in their shoes. I'm close to ""overweight"" and getting nowhere with running. I haven't felt good on a run since this track season when I PRd in the mile. I just feel so sluggish and I know some of it's in my head, but I feel like my eating habits are the cause. 

Throughout high school, I went through periods where I'd ""restrict"" for a week but I never made it long enough. I'd get ""inspired"" by the weight loss stories leading to much faster times. I just can't get myself to start again because I hate feeling hungry. I get headaches. I can't think. Yet sometimes it's so tempting. No ones there to watch how much I'm eating.

Now I'm close to crying because I ate way too much today. I've normally been a pretty consistent runner but I've had a terrible season so far. I bet if I weighed myself I'd be 3-4 pounds heavier and I'd honestly not know what to do. I feel like I eat way more than everyone else. Every day I want to start over and eat proper meals and less snacks but usually it never works. I still feel guilty after every meal. 

TLDR: I am terrified of gaining weight and getting even slower.",1631248609

151,AdvancedRunning,DonalG45,Jumping rope - Transfer to running,"Curious to get some opinions/stories of results on jumping rope as a cross-training tool or a stand-in for running when a person is unable to run.

My story:
I'm currently about halfway through a 2 week period in hotel quarantine, having recently emigrated to Australia.
I had a jump rope lying around at home and brought it with me, just in case I was unable to get any other exercise equipment (originally planned to get an exercise bike for the room).
After a couple of days jumping rope, I decided to forget about any other equipment and just focus on getting better at jumping rope.
I've done a short workout most days, usually consisting of 10 x 2 minute rounds, with 1 minute rest between rounds (so about 30 mins total workout time)
During these workouts, my heart rate is averaging out to about 160bpm, very similar to the average I get on an easy run.
I've also noticed some muscle soreness (the good kind ;) ) in my calves and feet and I wonder will working these muscle groups have some good transfer to faster running where getting up on the balls of the feet is more applicable. 
It has been a while since I've done any races but I reckon I was in about 21-22 minute 5k shape prior to emigrating. I've signed up for a 5k race the day after I get out of quarantine, so I'll update this post after and let you know what difference, if any, the jumping rope has made for me personally.

Looking forward to hearing any of your stories/experience with it!",1631240408

153,AdvancedRunning,orangecatfan,Recap/Results: 'Best of' Diamond League Championships,"*\[copy/paste of a write-up I self-published a few minutes ago in case it's of interest. spoiler warning: results from this week's Diamond League championships mentioned.\]*

The **Wanda Diamond League** concluded its 2021 season this week with a two-day championship meet in Zürich, Switzerland. Across 32 diamond events, professional track and field athletes competed for championship titles, which came with a $30,000 award, a Diamond Trophy and a wild-card entry to compete in the 2022 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon. The championship meet kicked-off yesterday, Wed. Sep. 8 with seven diamond finals, then resumed today with another 25 events.

Similar to last week’s Diamond League meet in Brussels, the **men’s 400m** opened the track part of today’s program with a neck-to-neck photo finish between American **Michael Cherry** and Tokyo bronze medalist **Kirani James** of Grenada. Cherry edged out James by .01 second, clocking a time of  44.41 to grab the win and a ticket to next summer’s World Championships.

Tokyo silver medalist **Anzhelika Sidorova** of Russia made a historical showing in the **women’s pole vault**. Sidorova secured herself a Diamond Trophy upon clearing 4.77m, then continued to match each bar raise until she surpassed 5.01m, becoming the third woman to ever break the five-meter barrier.

Tokyo gold medalist and fastest woman alive **Elaine Thompson-Herah** of Jamaica lined up for the **women’s 100m**, alongside Great Britain’s **Dina Asher-Smith**, who sought to end the season on a positive note after failing to qualify for the event final in Tokyo. Thompson-Herah clocked 10.65 in a  resounding win, while Asher-Smith ran her fastest time of the season  (10.87), grabbing second place.

Following Thompson-Herah’s win, four of the fastest sprinters in the world lined up for the **men’s 100m**: Americans **Fred Kerley**, **Trayvon Bromell** and **Ronnie Baker**, and Canada’s **Andre De Grasse**.  Following recent Diamond League wins in Brussels and Paris, Kerley delivered once again with a winning time of 9.87, edging out De Grasse by two hundredths of a second. De Grasse clocked a personal best (9.89), while Baker finished third (9.91).

Both the men’s and women’s 1500m ended in showdowns between the events’ top-two ranked athletes in the world.

In the **women’s 1500m**, the event’s Tokyo gold medalist **Faith Kipyegon** of Kenya out-kicked bronze medalist **Sifan Hassan** at the finish, winning in 3:58.33. Hassan placed second (3:58.55), while American **Josette Norris** finished third (4:00.41) — a significant rebound for the middle-distance runner who failed to qualify for the Olympics after finishing 8th in the women’s 5000m at U.S. trials.

In similar fashion, Tokyo silver medalist **Timothy Cheruiyot** of Kenya won the **men’s 1500m** in 3:31.37, slightly edging out Olympic champion **Jakob Ingebrigtsen** of Norway, who clocked 3:31.45. Australian **Stewart McSweyn** placed third (3:32.14).

In stride with what emerged as the theme of the day —  down-to-the-wire-races-between-the-bests — the men and women’s 200m delivered neck-to-neck finishes that were too close for broadcast  commentators to make initial, naked eye calls on who won.

Jamaica’s **Shericka Jackson** barreled down the final meters of the **women’s 200m** with a promising lead, but was out-kicked by Namibia’s **Christine Mboma**, who won in 21.78, breaking the U20 world record. Jackson placed second with a lifetime best of 21.81. Just over an hour after placing second in  the women’s 100m, Great Britain’s **Dina Asher-Smith** clocked 22.19 and added a third-place finish to her record.

The **men’s 200m** served up a rematch between the event’s Tokyo gold medalist **Andre De Grasse** (Canada) and silver medalist **Kenny Bednareck** (USA), as well as **Fred Kerley** (USA), who won over Bednareck in Paris two weeks ago. With perhaps ‘fresh legs’ as an advantage over his main competitors, Bednareck outran De  Grasse by two hundredths of a second, winning in 19.70. De Grasse placed second (19.72), while Kerley finished third (19.83).

American **Devon Allen** — who finished fourth in the Tokyo final — continued his post-Olympic hot streak in the **men’s 110m hurdles**, winning over medalists Hansle Parchment and Ron Levy of Jamaica. Allen and Levy both clocked times of 13.06, but the American crossed the line first by the smallest fraction of a second.

Yesterday, in her most significant match since failing to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics at U.S. trials, American **Maggie Ewen** won the **women’s shot put**, grabbing her first Diamond Trophy and a spot to compete in the 2022 World Championships — a world-class competition with stringent qualification standards as competitive as the Olympics (if not more).

While some athletes ended the season in Zürich by making up for disappointments in Tokyo — whether it was failure to win, medal or qualify — several Olympic gold medalists reaffirmed resounding dominance over their respective events.

Olympic champions **Pedro Pichardo** of Portugal and **Yulimar Rojas** of Venezuela delivered commanding wins in the **men’s** and **women’s triple jump**, with Rojas setting a new meet record of 15.48m.

In the **women’s** and **men’s high jump**, Tokyo gold medalists **Mariya Lasitskene** of Russia and **Gianmarco Tamberi** of Italy added another championship title to their collections, making  uncontested clearances at 2.05m and 2.34m respectively. Lasitskene broke the meet record and set a new world leading mark.

Olympic champions **Ryan Crouser** and **Valarie Allman** of the USA brought home their first Diamond Trophies, winning the **men’s shot put** (22.67m, meet record) and **women’s discus throw** (69.20m) respectively.

Looking strong down the final homestretch of the **men’s 400m hurdles**, world record holder **Karsten Warholm** of Norway won in 47.35.

I am a M30 and have been running for a bit over a year. I just ran a 1:32 HM and am starting to look into running form &amp; techniques to improve my time.

Two common pieces of advise for optimal running from Daniel's book is to run at 180 steps per min and to breathe with the 2-2 cycle (2 steps: breathe in, 2 steps: breathe out). 

I find this breathing method SO fast and unnatural, I am wondering if you guys manage to run like this? At this pace, I feel that my breathing cannot be deep enough at all and am wondering why it is considered optimal.

Is it better to go for quick breath or deeper breath for racing a distance such as the HM?",1631223743

### Training
I had been training for a 50 miler (Overlook Endurance Runs) for September 11th which got canceled due to the Caldor fire. My training was based around this race which I assumed to be quite warm so I was doing some heat training. I found an alternative, smaller race near San Diego, that was also much longer than I was training for. 

Since end of February, after recovering from a stress fracture I held 80km/50mile weeks training for a 50k in April. Post that race I kept up 80km/50mile weeks and did my first few road races (10k in May, 5k in July) while keeping long runs on the trails. In late july/august I hit some big weeks for me (111/121/113/100km) with longer runs (but no back to backs). My longest run was 60km/37miles and a few days later did 28miles for a birthday challenge. That week was a bit too intense and I went into an earlier taper than I was expecting to recover and did 45km (with a sad excuse for a half marathon trail race 3 weeks from race day), then 53km, then 28k the week of the 100k race. I kept up the heat training into the last week before the race.

### Pre-race
Rented a hipcamp camping spot the night before about 25 mins away from the race. Woke up at 3am, had a PB and banana sandwich and coffee. Luckily had to use the restroom immediately. Drove from where we were staying and got to the parking around 4:15am. Had an ez-up and cooler that I set up for my girlfriend to hang out by. The course was 8 laps, reversed every other lap, so we could just set up camp. It was already warm at 4:30am. I started out in a dryfit shirt and my salomon adv skin 12 vest with the 500ml flasks and my candy for the first loop. There were only 13 people starting the 100k. 

### Race
There we 13 people starting the 100k and the group started off so fast! Half of the field took off down cardiac hill. I hung out with the group in the back and it felt pretty comfortable. It was slightly faster than the pace I had planned for my ""dream"" time without the heat for 14:30 pace but I went with it for a while. I was embarrassed at the time, thinking that I would come in last place. I figured that if everyone else was going at that pace that I could at least hold on to the back pack. I ended up hanging out with S for the first three laps and part of the 4th. We took it ""easy"" which was still right around the 14:30 plan that I had made. It was still reasonable cool for the 2 laps, but the third started getting pretty warm. By 9am it was around 90F/32C.

After finishing lap 3 was when the ""fun"" started. On the 4th lap I ended up switching to full sun-avoidance mode and changed to my sun shirt and handhelds. S ended up leaving the aid station earlier and I thought I wouldn't see him again. That first lap in the heat was pretty brutal but managed to make it back to aid station relatively uneventfully. The even laps were a bit easier since the time between aid stations was a bit less due to running downhill on the longer section. Then I started putting ice everywhere I could before starting the laps. The ice-buff necklace was a life saver. I also filled up my hat and my shirt with ice. It actually stayed cold for about an hour which would get my to the mid-way aid station. This format was super nice for dealing with the heat since it was manageable for about 2 hours. Next time I would have a different hat that didn't flop around so much and a lighter sun shirt. I was drinking close to 2 20oz handhelds (1 with skratch and 1 with water) every hour.

My nutrition plan was pretty simple (and cheap). Start with Scandinavian swimmers (Trader Joe's version of Swedish Fish) for as long as I could stomach them ~ 6 every half hour (100 kcals), and switch to candied gingers (also from Trader Joe's) when my stomach needed something different. I also always had half fluids of skratch (I assume this was about 350mg of sodium and 80kcals for a bottle) and half plain water. I had planned on mixing in some gatoraid but the skratch continued to taste good the entire day. The first few laps I think I ate a bit off schedule but it was at least 200 kcals/hour of food so with the skratch and random sips of coke/mountain dew it was between 250-300kcals/hour, every hour until the last 30 minutes I skipped out. At lap 6 it hurt to chew so I switched to SIS isotonic gels till the finish. At the aid station I'd sip on coke or drink coconut water and swig some pickle juice. Literally only sugar for 16 hours and I estimate I consumed between 1000-1200g of sugar (4000-4800 kcals). The first thing I did when finishing was to brush my teeth, I should have done this after lap 5!

I hit 50km in about 6:51, and finished the 4th lap in 7:13. This was now midday and there was also a half-marathon and 50k going on at the same time. There were so many people that were overheated and lots of the 100k'ers were tending to people that ran out of water or were overheated. It hit 104F/40C in the canyon at the hottest part of the day. It was super dangerous conditions and lots of people dropped or had to be driven back to the start. One person was taken away by the paramedics. Once I did the first lap in the heat though I knew that I could do it with my icing strategy. I would literally fill up every part I could put ice into and sounded like someone mixing a thousand drinks at a bar. It was ridiculous but it works. I spent way more time at the aid stations because of this but I think it made a huge difference.

All this time I thought I was in close to last place. It wasn't until lap 6 that I caught up to someone I thought was in the front pack. He was surprised to see me and said he thought he was going to get first and DNF. Turns out there was only a women ahead of him. I walked with him for a while and chatted since he was dealing with some pretty bad cramps. I went on ahead after a while and once I got to the end of my 6th lap and it cooled down, I knew I had it. The 7th lap was tough and my toes hurt but I kept moving. Running hurt about the same as walking so I just kept running. 

The last lap was wild. I got into the aid station, grabbed my headlamp and started off. I saw the two other guys behind me that were about 15 minutes back. The one guys said he was going to catch me so I ""raced"" the last lap. I was really slow down the hills since my quads were shot and my toes were bruised but ran the flats ""hard"". I kept checking the trails for other headlamps but didn't see anyone behind me. The ended up running all but the steepest hills for the final lap to make sure that I got under 16 hours. Final time was 15:54, 2nd OA and first male.

### Post-race
Somehow I won prize money for being the first male ($100). Not at all how I had anticipated the race going. Felt super nauseated and sick after I finished since I pushed so hard up the hill. I dry heaved a bunch of times  and had super bad chills. Once I felt a bit better the first thing I did was to brush my teeth. I would  definitely brush my teeth mid race next time. I stayed till all my new friends came in to finish and then headed out. Ate a small portion of pasta and a larabar and then slept (terribly).

Recovery has been great and back to running today just a few days later. Really excited and happy about my performance. It was one of the hardest and most fun things I have ever done and I can't wait for the next one.

I ran 800m in HS and got really into 5k in my 20s for a while. 5'10"" 175 decent general fitness.

You're thinking ""no way in hell,"" right? Or at least, ""half is doable but it's gonna hurt . . . full not so much."" That's what I said in July too.

But I jumped my mpw from 0-40 in 3 weeks (I'm an idiot), didn't get hurt (much . . . I'm a lucky idiot) and have stayed there, structuring workouts off JD blue plan modified for my work schedule. On Sunday I ran 90-95% effort 5k TT in 22:30. Walk recovery for a few minutes and then mile cooldown.  Full day of rest and yesterday I did my last long run before the half.

Well it was supposed to be a long run. It turned into a negative split 1:53 HM and I felt froggy so finished out 30k in 2:45. I was fasted except for two scoops of Gatorade endurance 20 min before and one Honey Stinger @ 60 minutes. Avg HR was under 160. Legs felt great and still do today.

Now I have this crazy notion that I could not only run a marathon next month, but have a shot of doing it in a semi-respectable time say 4:00-4:15. And be able to walk the next day.

Please tell me (1) I'm an idiot and to save my entry fee or (2) I'm an idiot and the best way to approach this. I was thinking just stay at 40-50 mpw but all easy runs, condensed into longer runs in fewer days.

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known (or not so well-known) workouts.  

**This week is the Threshold-Long-Threshold (TLT)**.

*History:*

Workout of Clara Peterson (coached by Magdalena Lewy Boulet), 16th at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials

*Why:*

To satisfy two workouts in one session [a long run and a threshold-paced run]! This is a demanding session, but with great benefits. The inclusion of threshold running in the middle of 20-mile runs forces the running muscles to use up glycogen stores more rapidly than they would when running easy 20 miles.

*How:*

Run 20 minutes easy for a warm-up. Then run 3 x 15 minutes at your tempo pace (15 seconds faster per mile than your goal marathon pace) with 3 minutes rest between repeats. Then run 60 minutes easy and follow that with a final set of 15 minutes at tempo pace. Conclude the workout with 20 minutes of easy running. This will provide two hours and 40 minutes of quality running and prepare you well physically and mental for marathon race day.

170,AdvancedRunning,Yaverland,100km ultramarathon - Choosing a goal time,"M35 gearing up for my first 100km race this Saturday. I need help choosing a goal time.

The course is along the Thames river from London to Henley. It is flat albeit a very gradual upward climb. It is set to be warm during the late morning and afternoon but not scorching. 

I am considering targetting sub 9 hours, which means running at about 5:20/km (8:38/mile) with a little extra time for aid station stops. This is slower than all my typical training runs except the odd lazy recover run. B goal would be to keep pace below 5:30/km.

Relevant training info:

*Currently doing an average of 80km a week, peaking at 100km last week.
*Very recently did a HM in 1:27 at a brisk pace, but not flat out. I think I could have gone under 1:25 if I had pushed. 
*Recent 5K in 18:45.
*Recent training runs include a marathon last weekend in 3:40m with around 32km at 4:50-*5:00/km. This felt ok but I was a bit wiped by the end.
* I have done a few 50km+ runs, including a 75km trail run with 1500m elevation. But the most comparable was a flat riverside 50K (my first ultra) which I did in 4hr17. This was three months ago and early into my return from injury and I feel a am a lot stronger since then.
*I had to take time out for injury late last year until around March (plantar fasciitis) and have been building back since. 
*This time last year I was running 100-130km a week. I hit a marathon PR of 2:56 on a flat course in bad conditions. Tune up races were a ten mile of 62 mins and a 10K of 36:40. Earlier in the year I did 5K in 17:50 and a HM in under 1:23. I am not at this level right now but getting back there.

I’m a 38 year old male training for my first marathon in November. I started training in June by signing up for Hal Higdon’s Intermediate 2 marathon training plan. The plan has been a blessing for me as it provides structured workout which is dynamic and helps me stay focused for my target goal of finishing the race in 4 hours. 

I’ve slowly ramped up my per week mileage, and now at 42 (+/- 3) miles a week. I’ve ran two half marathons, and a 15, 16, 17 mile runs over last few weekends. I foam roll after long runs and  stretch as well. Lately, I have this dull pain in my right leg below the knee, outer side (could be soleus or pernoeus Longus or tibial). It’s hard to point the exact source, and I can’t tell if it’s muscle or nerve. Sorry, I know this sounds awfully vague. My legs feel extremely tight, and running shorter distances has been more and more difficult. It’s taken the fun out of running/training. What am I doing wrong?

172,AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Opinions on negative splits with 5k/6k? Experiences?,"I was going to try to aim for negative splits during my next race (6k). I used to be in shape to run a 21 min 5k PR where my first mile was always the fastest around 6:35, but recently I had a horrible race and split a 6:45 - 7:08 - 10:29 (walked). I want to aim for a sub 27 minute 6k (distance changes next race) by starting around 7:15-7:20, and then working down from there. I'm going to talk to my coach, but is this too slow to start out? 

The reason I'm asking is I was looking at past results for this race where they gave the breakdown splits and it seemed like it was common for the first mile to even be a minute faster than the second. I really don't want to put myself through that kind of pain, even though I know that all my 5k PRs have been from positive splitting (yet my half marathon and 10k PRs are from negative). Everyone who finished around 26:50 for the 6k seemed to go out in 6:45 which is 30 sec faster than I was planning..... Does that even make sense? If so, I'm a little worried. What happens if I start out at 7:15 and can't really get down from there, but instead go SLOWER? How can I be patient with negative splits....?",1631030320

### Training

Training has been pretty bumpy, to say the least... I started training seriously around the start of 2021, after having spent close to a year just doing easy running and stagnating. Followed the Pfitz 12/63 half marathon plan up until a time trial in late May, where I was going for 1:25 (with a PB at the time of \~1:35). I ended up DNFing the TT at 9.5 miles; a combination of poor planning (hot sun, and a busy park as I started late), and psyching myself out. A week later, I reattempted the TT with a modified goal of sub 1:30, finishing in 1:28:02.

I was planning on taking a couple of weeks to run an ultra and recover, then heading into Pfitz 12/70 for the Manchester marathon in October. I pushed myself to do too much too soon, and stopped the Pfitz plan after just 2.5 weeks, feeling pretty burned out of running in general. Took a week or two of only running when I actively wanted to, then started again with just trying to hit around 50-60 miles per week, with two track sessions per week at a local athletics club that I recently joined, and long runs in preparation for the marathon. After the marathon I'm planning to focus on improving my 1 mile/5k/10k times for a while, so I figured I'd just enjoy the marathon and see how it went. My PB is 3:28 which was an impulse marathon extended from a 20 miler where I had no nutrition or water, so I knew I'd easily break it regardless.

Originally my target was sub 3 for the marathon, which I adjusted to 3:10 after the failed TT, and adjusted to ""get a PB"" after stopping the Pfitz plan, but relaxing the pressure on myself allowed me to enjoy training again, so I began to think about some more ambitious goals again.

In short, I had no idea of my current fitness. I thought it had gone way downhill, but I felt good hitting similar splits to when I was at peak fitness at track sessions. With the marathon on October 10th approaching fast, I wanted to race a half to see where I'm at and set some targets accordingly. I entered a purportedly flat half marathon a few miles from where I live to set a benchmark.

### Pre-race

The race was due to start at 9am. I woke up at 6am and ate a large bowl of oats with soya milk and maple syrup, with some black coffee and a pint and a half of water to flush it down. I need the bathroom a lot when I'm nervous, so gave myself plenty of time to get that out of my system before leaving the house at 7:45 for the 15 minute bike ride to the start line. Attached my timing chip and number, couple more toilet trips and a warm up, and I was ready to go. I joined the 1:25-1:30 section of the starting pen. I'd outwardly said I was just going to go for a 1:30, but was feeling pretty confident that I was fit enough for a PB.

### Race

Being a fairly small race, the start went very smoothly - arranged by finish time and socially distanced at the start, so I was immediately in a group of runners going around my pace. The start was between the Olympic stadium and some skyscrapers, so I didn't expect my watch to be accurate; I just planned to use the mile markers, start at 6:45/mile (4:10/km) and see how it went.

The course was a wiggly one, with a full half marathon packed into a pretty small park. There were several 180 degree turns, and whilst I wouldn't call it hilly, there were a good number of short but steep climbs, making it not the easiest course I've ever done. The first mile, however, was pretty flat, and I went through the mark in 6:19. Way faster than what I'd planned, but not too much faster than my dream goal of sub 1:25. I decided to reign it in and stay comfortable for now. My watch said that the first mile was short, as well, so I decided that I was likely actually on around PB pace.

After another mile, I got the sense that I'd been too cautious off the start. I came through in 6:32 feeling very comfortable, even for mile 2 of a half marathon. I'd settled into a small group, and the group ahead of us was slowly pulling away, so I decided to go with them.

Miles 3 through to 8 felt amazing. I felt better than I had at the same point in previous half marathons, and was slowly picking people off one by one. The miles kept coming up slightly short on my watch, and I had decided in advance to trust the markers over my watch, so I just assumed the wiggly route and occasional underpass had got the better of the GPS. I was flying past people though, particularly in miles 7 and 8; I knew that if the splits were to be trusted I was on for low 1:20s at this point and should smash even my most ambitious target time.

Around the end of mile 8 I started to feel the sting. I'd been gradually escalating my effort over the last few miles to pass people, so I decided to just hold on until the end now. I didn't feel like I'd really slowed down, so was surprised to see a split time 25 seconds slower than the last one at the end of mile 9. It was still faster than 1:25 pace, though, so I figured I'd just roll with it and hope I could hang on.

Miles 10 and 11 were a constant battle with myself to hold onto the pace and ignore the part of me that was saying I'd done enough and to settle for a PB. Thankfully, around the start of this part, I'd caught up with a woman who was pushing hard, and matching someone stride for stride was all that got me through this part. Mile 11 felt a bit faster, but it was at this point that I realised the mile markers were definitely off; a 5:51 would be one of the fastest miles I've ever run, and I wasn't breaking any speed records at this stage.

With 2.1 miles to go I edged away from the woman I was running with, and towards a fairly long incline that we'd done near the start of the race. Up here I felt like I was seriously fading, and I twice overtook a guy who stopped to walk for a few seconds before racing ahead of me again. Fastest run/walk half marathon I've ever seen! The 12 mile marker was just after another 180 degree turn, and I went through in 6:47.

I did a bit of mental maths at this stage (which I've since realised was very wrong) and decided I needed to do the last 1.1 miles in 7:30 to be able to break 1:25. This was going to be a push, but I just had to not fade any more. However, we were now doing the reverse of a section of the course we'd done at the start, and I knew that it was more than 0.1 miles to the 1 mile marker. Fueled by anger about the bad mile markers, I pushed around the corner and up around the stadium again.

It became clear that the last 1.1 was much further than 1.1 miles, and that I wasn't going to do it in under 7:30. I was seriously pissed off at myself now. In my head, I'd messed up the pacing and missed a good shot at sub 1:25, so I lost focus and didn't push it as hard as I should have for the last half a mile. I mustered up a bit of a kick for the last 100m, but thought I was coming over the line in about 1:26, so was very confused to see that the time was 10:24:24 as I crossed the line.

### Post-race

I crossed the line very confused and sat down on a bench with a couple of bottles of water and a flapjack for a few minutes. I was too tired to understand what had happened at this point. I was pleased with a PB, but didn't really dare to believe I'd hit the 1:25, even though my watch said I'd only been running for less than that. I cycled home with my girlfriend after a lot of water, then checked the results, and it was only then that the time sunk in. The rest of the day I pretty much just ate, had a nap, went for a short walk, and felt very pleased with myself.

Clearly a slightly inconsistent couple of months hasn't wiped out the 6 months of quality training I had beforehand. I've got 5 weeks until the marathon, and whilst I'd love to convert this half time into a sub 3, I don't think I've really done the training to back it up. I certainly perform better in longer distances (my 10k and HM times are much better than my 5k and 1 mile times), but I've not really done any marathon pace workouts in my long runs, and don't really have time to build up that endurance fitness much.

Furthermore, I've never raced a marathon. I've jogged one with friends (4:40), run one alone as a long easy run (3:28) and done a 50k trail race, so I'm fine with the distance, but have never run fast for longer than a half. Given this, and the general tendency for younger men to underperform in marathons relative to shorter distances, I'm aiming for 3:05-3:10. If anyone thinks this is too ambitious or too conservative, or has any advice for a first fast marathon, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed!

177,AdvancedRunning,xalendrio,Just finished my first Half and want to build up to Marathon,"Hello guys,

Yesterday I just ran my first half marathon in competition, after a bit more than a year of consistent running. It was my first big running objective, aimed for a sub 1h30 and did 1h29', so really happy. Above all, I just loved the experience from preparation to race day, and really can't wait to head towards my next objective. 

Actually, I already have in mind the Paris Marathon planned in early april 2022. I know it's quite a long time from now but I have some questions about my approach to this new goal.

1) I often hear that one should consider running a marathon after at least 2 years or so of consistent running. Although I am really excited about going for a 42km, I don't want to rush it and don't want it to be destructive physically and/or mentally, as I'm conscious running this distance is not harmless. And I realize I am not that experienced as a runner. Actually, I was a competitive cyclist in my youth but totally got out of sports for several years before coming back more than a year ago. So: is it too soon to think about a marathon?

2) What would be a reasonable objective given my HM time and my running experience? I think I could aim for a sub 3h30, but could I be more ambitious?

3) Most marathon training plans seem to extend over 12 weeks, that is January to March for the race I have in mind. How should I train until then, in order to begin this preparation in the best possible conditions?

4) I also have other sporting objectives for the next year. Indeed, I also got into triathlon this year and completed one short distance. I plan to race some other tris in summer 2022 and build up to Olympic distance. But I am a bit terrible at swimming and would really want to swim consistently this winter. Does it seem reasonable to pursue these two objectives in parallel, knowing that I will have only a few weeks to recover from the marathon and head towards my tri season? 

To add a few precisions, I am really willing to invest effort and time in those objectives. I already ran 4 times a week for my HM preparation, and consistently had at least 6 activities with swimming and cycling sessions.

I would be thankful for any insight",1630929036

## Training

Training for this race was a little less specific and focused than I typically like. I have raced a few times this summer, all with varying distances and difficulties. I have done a hilly trail 50km in June, a mountainous trail half marathon in early July, and a flat road half marathon at the end of July. The intermittent racing over a variety of distances didn't set me up very well to have the proper buildup and micro-cycling that I like in my training. Oh well. On the upside, I've been doing heftier long runs earlier than usual in the season because of the race schedule. 

About 3.5 weeks prior to the Marquette Marathon I had to bail on some longer workouts and long runs because of an issue in my lower calf and ankle, so in the last month-ish I didn't have a long run over 18 miles in length. My workouts under about 13 miles in length have been solid, however. Two key workouts that helped me maintain confidence in myself came \~2 weeks before the race. I did 5 x (1 mile at half marathon pace, 1/2 mile float) on a hot and humid morning. I averaged 5:38/mile for the miles and averaged 6:20/mile for the float. The next workout was 8 x 1km with every other km being 20 seconds faster. I averaged 3:00/km on the hard ones and 3:20/km on the easy ones. I felt so strong in both workouts. Light, fast, effortless. I figured that despite the lack of long runs I would be okay for the marathon. 

## Pre-race

Nothing out of the ordinary here. I woke up 2 hours before the race start, ate a few bagels, had some coffee, and rolled my muscles before leaving the house. It's best not to overthink things on race day. It's nice to live in Marquette because I got to sleep in my own bed and get dropped off at the start by my girlfriend. It was spitting rain all morning, so I warmed up in a raincoat and pants.

## Race

I haven't had this much fun during a race in quite a long time! The Marquette Marathon serves as a fund raiser for the local college, Northern Michigan University, so the race directors recruit the school's athletes to man aid stations, road crossings, and the finish line. As an NMU alum myself (I graduated in 2020), I knew quite a few workers out on the course. In fact, the lead bikers were two of my best friends on the school's nordic ski team. I train with them frequently, so the race just felt like a routine long run with them. They were cracking jokes, keeping me company, holding my bottles, and making sure I got the proper fuel from the aid stations. Having my training partners on bikes with me felt a little unfair at times, but there are no rules against stuff like this at such a small race. 

I was in the lead right from the gun and cruising pretty comfortably at roughly 6-flat pace over some rolling hills in the first 8 miles of the race. The course is exclusively on a bike path that goes from the town of Ishpeming to Marquette. It's pretty fun because Ishpeming sits about 900 feet in elevation above Marquette, so miles 10 - 17 are all downhill. You lose about 100 ft/mile over this period, so it's a nice break on the cardiovascular system but it's a little tough on the legs if you aren't prepared. I could feel my calf flair up a little bit around mile 14, but it wasn't bad enough to slow me down. 

There was only one other runner with me during the race, but he was consistently just 10m behind me (odd choice) until mile 20 when he started to fall off. The last 6 miles are perfectly flat along Lake Superior but include one \~100ft hill with about 3 miles to go. After the long downhill to reach Marquette, the flats and even the little hill felt nice on the legs. It's amazing how a slight change in your form affects your body. I did end up having a few slower miles in the final 1/4 of the race, but it wasn't enough to take me out of the race. This is probably due to my lack of proper long runs in the last month or so. I've also found that you need to actively try and accelerate during the final miles in a marathon just to keep your same pace. I was pushing really hard at this point and focusing on my form just to hold off any cramping that could happen. I love getting to this point in races. It's a single-minded pursuit to the finish line. 

I crossed the line in 2:39:08 and was greeted by a bunch of my friends who were working the event. I also found out that the winner from the half marathon ran 1:06 (hot damn!) so it was fun to chat with him for a while. 

## Post-race

Beer, shower, snack, awards ceremony, nachos, nap. In that order. The rain finally stopped by mid-afternoon so by the evening I was ready to walk around town with some friends and grab a few more drinks. Great day all-in-all!

## Training

I'm currently at the tail-end of a Pfitzinger 18/70 plan for the London Marathon.  This race lined-up nicely with the final 'tune-up' race, and was just down the road from me, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Maybe I could come in with a finish time that was a 'safe' predictor of going sub-3 at London.

I re-jigged a few scheduled workouts to fit this one in: moving the long run to earlier in the week, and hoped that having a few recovery runs later in the week would rest the legs enough that they wouldn't blow-up in the later miles.  Although I was hoping for a sub 1:25 time, I wanted to keep in mind that this wasn't my A-race, it was just an elaborate training run. No need to go all-in...

## Race

The course is a 13.1 mile loop around Southampton.  There are half and full marathons run concurrently, with the full marathon being two laps.

The course itself is fairly flat, with most of the 500ft/150m elevation in 3 climbs.

## Miles 0-3

The start was a bit of a mess.  Both the half and the full marathons started at the same time, in a massed start, with no timing pens.  I was fortunate to be near the front, but the first half a mile was cluttered and claustrophobic while the various pace groups emerged.  I spent most of the first mile swerving around people and trying to keep out of other people's way until things cleared.  I found myself in a group of people doing 6:00 min miles.  It felt comfy, but I thought it was a bit ambitious so dialled the pace back to \~06:15.  Still too fast but I was enjoying myself.

These miles took us through the centre, past the docks and into the first big climb - up over the Itchen Bridge.  Whilst not a big climb really, the bridge looms up in front of you and looks pretty daunting.

This also had one of the more surreal moments of the race: a group of cheerleaders on one side of the road - waving pom-poms and doing a routine - and a bunch of anti-vaccination protesters with conspiracy placards on the other.

I used the climb to slow myself down to my target pace of 06:20-25.  This only lasted until the peak, then I was back to 06:15.

## Miles 4-6

This section looped us past the waterfront, through some residential areas and then back over the bridge. I spent a large chunk of this section trading places with one of the marathoners - they were looking stronger than I was feeling, and I hope they kept it up until the end.

Try as I might, I couldn't settle into my goal pace. If I tried to hit it I'd either slow to 06:40, or speed to 05:50 pace.  Eventually I conceded to the momentum and decided to hold 06:15 - I'd deal with any fall-out later on. I was going to go all-in.

## Miles 7-9

The early fast miles and the heat of the day were starting to make themselves felt in this section.  It was also pretty tedious - through industrial estates and arterial roads (and another few clusters of anti-vaccination nutters) - the only highlight being a run through Southampton FC's stadium (I'm not a Saints fan, but it was still a nice experience).

I settled in with a loose group of 3-4 runners. We ate up these miles, trading places occasionally and pressing each other to keep the pace going.  I could feel the things slipping a bit, but I knew that there was one more climb to go, so didn't want to push too hard too early. These were my slowest and toughest miles.

## Miles 10-13.1

This section took us through a park alongside the river - which was wonderfully shady and breezy - before a mile-long climb and a loop back down through the Southampton Common to the finish line.

Somewhere in the park I pulled ahead of the group I was in, but there was no-one visible in front of me.  These were some really lonely miles.  The support from spectators here was fantastic and really worked wonders for keeping me going through the climb. Although I slowed, I remained in-touch with my revised goal pace of 06:15.

At the top of Southampton Common I hit that magical point where you realise that you've done it - you no longer need to keep anything in reserve.  I picked up the pace and just emptied the tanks to take me to the finish line.  Again, the support here was amazing - especially in the last few hundred metres - everyone cheering and banging on the railings spurred me to a sprint finish, despite the exhaustion in my legs.

Chip time: 1:22:38

## Post-race

Very pleased with that performance.  It bodes well for my goal of sub-3 at London.

The course itself wasn't too bad, fairly flat and fast.  However, Southampton isn't really a scenic city, so there's not much in the way of highlights to look forward to along the route.

That said, it was great to be racing again - I'd forgotten how much the crowd and other runners can help you through the tougher parts.

One more tough week of training to go, then into the taper for my goal race!

**TL;DR**

First marathon attempt: DNF. Started running for the first time two years ago. Did a 16 week training plan for the marathon which peaked at 45 mpw. Longest training run was 17.2 miles. Didn’t consume enough water during the race, lots of stomach cramping, got dehydrated, had diarrhea at mile 16, run-walking by mile 18, threw in the towel at mile 20. 

**Background**

28M, 160 lbs (73kg). I’ve always been an athletic person, but never a runner. Played baseball in high school, skied in the winters, and played pick up basketball in college and beyond. Only time I ran was at the gym on a treadmill or occasionally outside as an attempt to “stay healthy”. Of course I would go out and run as fast as I could and get tired after a mile or two and resign to the fact that I wasn’t a runner. Somehow, I caught the running bug in 2019. First run on Strava was June 2nd, 2019 for 2 mi at 8:36/mi pace (!). I remember being so winded on this run that I barely made it the two miles. Despite not knowing what I was doing, I managed to build up some endurance to the point that I could run consistently without it being a total suffer fest. 

Continued running 2-3 times per week throughout 2019 and 2020. Did not know about heart rate zones and didn’t have a heart rate monitor. Did manage to build up mileage to the point where I was running 20-30 mpw through. Wasn’t following a specific plan. I thought if I gradually increased my mileage that was fine. Would make every run of the week 5 miles, then the next week 5.5 miles, for example. Of course looking back at my paces, I was running them all at tempo because I didn’t know about easy days. Of course I got hurt multiple times in 2020 (IT band first, knee second, hip third, etc) because I didn’t have any easy days and I probably wasn’t resting and eating enough. 

Despite all this naïveté, I did manage to run my first half marathon on September 12, 2020 in 1:55 (\~9 min/mi). Did not have a HR monitor at this time. Tried to keep running after this with the goal of completing a marathon, but kept getting hurt and very frustrated I couldn’t keep up the running volume. I rested most of the winter to try and get over this nagging hip injury and at some point started watching running videos on YouTube (Sage Cannaday, The Running Channel, Nick Bare) and realized I needed to incorporate more slow days and follow an actual training plan if I wanted to build up my mileage and not get hurt. 

**Training**

Decided on the beginner-intermediate training plan from higherrunning.com because I liked Sage Cannaday’s videos on YouTube. 16 week plan starting at 20 mpw building up to 45-50 mpw. Bought a heart rate monitor, which was game changing. Started fueling properly before and after runs (Skratch drink mix on runs longer than 60-90 minutes, ate more overall to meet caloric needs). Read advanced marathoning by Pete Pfitzinger. Did not get hurt once throughout the 16 week training plan (which I attribute to proper recovery between hard runs, proper fueling, actually having easy days). 

I haven’t done an official VO2 max test, but based on my age and training I guessed my max HR was somewhere between 186-190. Aimed for an average HR on easy days of 135-40 (9:30 min/mi), tempo 145-155 (8:30 min/mi), threshold 160-165 (7:45 min/mi). 

Peak week was 45 miles, which was about 4 weeks out from the goal marathon. The training plan I was following called for a 3 week taper, but when I started following the plan I miscounted the weeks, so had an extra week towards the end. Longest run prior to the marathon (33 days out) was 17.2 miles at an average 8:49 min/mi pace, average HR 147 bpm. 

**Pre-race**

Last long run was 10 miles, 7 days out from the race. My hip was bothering me towards the end, so I decided to not run the rest of the week and give it a chance to rest. Did 2 hour-long, zone 2 bike rides during the week instead. Loaded up on carbs the two days prior (\~500g carbs each day). Woke up at 4 am race day and ate a bowl of overnight oats (½ cup rolled oats, 1 cup almond milk, a scoop of greek yogurt, ½ banana) and had a cup of black coffee. Drank 500 mL of water with 1 scoop of Skratch mix in it at 5:30 am. Got to the race at 6:15 am, did some dynamic warm up, jogged for a few minutes and did some strides. 

**Race**

Thought it would be pretty good running weather (60-65 degrees, 97% humidity, cloud cover). Based on my long runs, I was hoping I could hold between 8:30-8:45 min/mi pace for 26.2 miles. This should have been my tempo zone, but perhaps I was overreaching. I don’t know if it was race day jitters or if I was starting out dehydrated, but the first two miles of the race I was running 9 min/mi pace and my HR almost immediately was up in the 145 range. On all of my training runs, I would run my easy days at this pace and it would take at least 2-3 miles before my HR was in the 130-140s. My goal was to try and keep my HR 145 ish for the first half of the marathon, then 145-155 ish for the second half. Felt okay for the first 10 miles. Paces were slower than I wanted, but I adjusted my sights to my secondary goal which was sub 4 hours. 

Aid stations were every 2.5 miles or so. I had a waist bottle with me that had 500 mL of water and a scoop of Skratch mix (20 g carb, 300 mg sodium) in it. I stopped at each aid station and had a few gulps of water, then finished my drink mix bottle by the halfway point. Picked up another bottle of the Skratch mix at the halfway point. For nutrition I had dried pineapple rings in my pocket (consumed 25 g of carbs worth in the first half). I tried Gu gels in training but on one of two of my long runs I had some GI upset, which I attributed to the gels. My 17 mile long run I had done with natural foods (dried pineapple rings and nectarines) and didn’t have an GI upset. I was aiming for 20 g carbs/hour (80g total over the marathon). 

Around mile 10 my stomach felt kind of crampy. Was adjusting my waist belt thinking maybe it was too tight. Didn’t feel like I was able to drink as much as I would have liked because of this discomfort. Came in at 13.1 mi at 1:58. Continued on at a consistent pace feeling okay fatigue wise. By mile 15 my stomach was really churning and I didn’t feel like I could drink more of my Skratch mix but did think water sounded good. By mile 16 there was an aid station and I felt like I really had to go number 2. Had massive diarrhea for a few minutes. Realized this was probably it for my goal of sub 4 hours. Shifted my sights to just finishing the race. Continued on at 9:30 min/mi pace for another mile or two, then felt so low on energy I had to start walking. Ran 10 min/mi pace for a few minutes, then walked. Kept this up from miles 18-20 before I started to get light headed and decided it was time to throw in the towel. Called my wife to come pick me up. I had filled up my bottle with 500 mL of straight water at the 20 mi aid station and managed to drink the whole thing, but still felt light headed just sitting there.

**Post-race**

Barely made it the 5 min car ride home without passing out. Immediately laid on the floor, was shivering, and felt like absolute trash. Laid there for 2 hours or so, took a little snooze. Wasn’t feeling like I could eat/drink anything. Took a few sips of water after 2 hours and it felt okay. Tried to get up and take a shower, but barely made it 2 minutes under the water before I felt so light headed I wanted to throw up. Caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I looked white as a ghost. Laid back down on the couch for a few hours and did nothing. Probably another 2 hours after that I felt like I could start sipping water. Ate a few crackers. Managed to keep that down and felt okay. Ate some more food and drank a total of probably 1000 mL. Stood up off the couch without passing out probably 4-5 hours after getting home from the race. Drank more water and had a big dinner. Felt much better by the end of the night.  

**Thoughts**

Absolutely embarrassed by my execution of this race. Never blew up this bad on my long runs leading up to the race. I think the primary problem was I overestimated my water intake at the aid stations and didn’t compensate for the fact that it was 97% humidity. Despite it being 62 degrees at the start of the race, I was still sweating quite a bit in the first half. It’s hard to estimate how much water I consumed, but 2-3 gulps at each station (6 along the course) probably added up to 250-500 mL, totaling 1000 mL of liquid in the first half. This is lower than what I would consume on my training long runs (would usually hit about 1500 mL for a similar distance, but this was always in hotter weather, so I assumed I wouldn’t need as much for this cooler race). The GI distress was the nail in the coffin because after that I really didn’t feel like I could consume an adequate amount of liquid. Unclear if this distress was from dehydration or from something else. I didn’t feel like my heart rate ever got out of control (average for the whole run was 149 bpm). Even towards the end when I was about to blow up, my HR was only 145-150, which should be at the lower end of my zone 3. Perhaps my inadvertent 4 week taper instead of 3 cost me some fitness.

I fell in love with running over the past year and really enjoyed this training block. I always looked forward to going out for a run and felt like I hit most of my training goals. Really disappointed but also humbled by this marathon attempt. As soon as I felt better last night, I was already looking forward to getting back out there and running again. I had signed up for two marathons this fall because I wasn’t sure if COVID would lead to cancellations. The next marathon is on November 14th (10 weeks from now). I was planning on following one of the modified, 8 week plans from Advanced Marathoning for this block since it’s shorter (giving myself 2 weeks of recovery). Mileage will peak at 50-60 mpw with the longest run being 19 miles. Happy to have a second shot at finishing a marathon this season. Going to set my primary goal at just finishing the marathon this time with a secondary goal being sub 4 hours.",1630844602
187,AdvancedRunning,FLP6,Sudden strong urge to pee during hard runs. Help!,"Hey everyone! Been lurking around this sub for a while now and it's my first time to post.

As what the title says, do you sometimes experience sudden strong urge to pee during hard runs?

I'm 31[M] and I've been running for 10 years now. But just recently, during my interval sessions, I get this sudden strong urge to pee whenever I go fast in between sets. And when I stop to take a pee, it stings a bit and the urge doesn't really go away after peeing. And I feel that there's some urine left but couldn't drain it all out. 

I have already consulted with a Urologist about this and did some blood works. Based on the result, the doctor couldn't find anything that correlates and causes this urinary issue during high intensity running.. But maybe except my elevated LDL cholesterol that could have possibly contribute to the problem. But he's not really so sure.

For reference.. I consider myself generally fit and above average runner. I'm 179cm tall and weighs 65kg for perspective. 

Anyone else have experienced this?? This really bothers me alot.

Hoping to learn from someone else's experience on how to fix this problem.

199,AdvancedRunning,jstarke7311,Berlin (9/26) to Boston (10/11) Coaching Tips needed!,"TLDR: Tips for running back to back marathons in 2 weeks for injury prone runner on borrowed leg time. Finished an 18, do I taper now for Berlin to use it as training run for Boston. Tips? 

I’ll start out by saying I shouldn’t be running either of these races… I’m on a twice replaced ACL (but over 10 years and 2 marathons since then). I have been running most of my life, genes just aren’t built for it… however that may be I got a bib for Berlin last year, started training and it was cancelled, ended up getting a knee scoped and bone marrow injection last year instead, knee feels better than it did for years! I was training for about 16 weeks preparing for this years (2 setback weeks but long runs still completed at 11-13 min miles), when I received a dream opportunity to run Boston. So, as someone who is most likely not going to get a chance to see majors 5 and 6 (Chicago 2013, NYC 2018), I couldn’t pass on this. 

Anyway, had a dumb ankle injury 2 weeks back from pushing from my normal 10-12 min shorter run pace to 7-8 min. Took the rest of the week off with some pain, and then ran my 18 miler on 8/21. Couldn’t walk the next day without pain below ankle (feels like some Achilles tendinitis) After much ice, 2 weeks of rest missing my 14 miler taper long run, bike for 30 min daily last week, 3 accu/chiro sessions, I feel ready to get another long run in, if anything to build confidence mentally. I plan on continuing the accu/chiro 3x a week, torodol injection after this weekends run, and tapering dropping down to 1-2 runs a week until Berlin.

Berlin will serve to be my longest “training run” trying to save my legs as much as I can for Boston. Ice bathes and accu/chiro/light yoga daily with another massage in between.

Thoughts on the plan? Taper? How long my run should be this weekend after not running seriously for 2 weeks? Any tips would really help!",1630733228
200,AdvancedRunning,AdventureAwesome,Need Advice regarding maintenance miles,"I thrive on following a plan prior to a goal race but struggle with structuring the in between or maintenance miles before my next race build up.

For example, I will follow plan for 12-16 weeks for goal HM in the spring then take some time off…maybe a week or two to recover. My next goal race might not be until October or November so I’m always left wondering how to run in between theses times without losing to much fitness.

How should I structure my running during these off times to maintain running fitness? What strategies do others follow when competing in multiple races a year?Should I take extended time off, reduce mileage, cross train?",1630715075
201,AdvancedRunning,MotivicRunner,Tokyo Paralympic Marathon Preview,"The Tokyo 2020/1 Paralympics are quickly coming to a close, and this weekend is will be the marathons to cap things off for the athletics program. I haven't seen much discussion about para-athletics this past week, so I thought I would preview these marathons to hopefully generate some more interest in para-sport. The official Paralympics website also has a [couple](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/paralympics/sports/athletics/#para-discipline-description-athletics-marathon) [previews](https://www.paralympic.org/news/tokyo-paralympics-para-athletics-day-10-preview), as well.

**When:** Sunday, September 5 @ 6:30am Tokyo time (UTC+9) -- That's Saturday afternoon/evening for North Americans (5:30pm on the east coast, 2:30pm on the west coast) and Saturday night for people in Europe. Double check the [official schedule](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/paralympic-schedule-and-results-date=2021-09-05.htm) for the latest updates.

**Where to watch:** This will depend on your region, and whether or not you wish to use a VPN.

* **USA** \- TV broadcast on the [Olympic Channel](https://stream.nbcolympics.com/210904-olympic-channel-marathons), online streaming through [Peacock](https://stream.nbcolympics.com/para-track-field-s19-marathons) (full disclosure, I am very unfamiliar with the NBC broadcast schemes, so my links could be wrong).
* **Youtube** \- The [Paralympic Games Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/paralympics) should have a livestream. According to [Google](https://blog.google/products/search/paralympics-tokyo-games/), the stream will be available to 219 countries, so it should be accessible to most people outside the US. The stream will also be kept on the channel for later viewing in case you can't catch the races live. I've personally checked with a VPN connection to Canada and have been able to access the [livestreams and VODs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6CBAXPeBajmBZJ0XSQbsBU6y7K_D_i5M) that way.

**The course**

The athletes will be racing on the original Tokyo course that was also intended to be used for the Olympic marathons. It's almost as if the unilateral decision by the IOC to move the Olympic marathons and race walks 500 miles north to Sapporo was more about the optics of all the carnage from the 2019 world championships in Doha instead of actually looking out for the athletes.

The athletes will start and finish at the Olympic stadium, and pass by a number of iconic locations, including the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Tower, as they race through the streets of central Tokyo. The Tokyo Metropolitan government has a [good document with an overview of the course](https://www.2020games.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/course_English.pdf). The last \~5km are a steady climb back up to the Olympic stadium, so if any of the races are close that will likely be an important stretch to follow closely.

**Categories**

Because of the wide spectrum of impairments that can affect the athletes, they are separated into categories based on the type and severity of their impairments. World Para-Athletics maintains a webpage [describing all of the possible categories](https://www.paralympic.org/athletics/classification), while the Paralympic Games website has a [helpful general overview](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/paralympics/games/classification/) in case you want to learn more about how other sports handle classification. There are three main categories represented in this year's marathon.

* **T11/12** \- These athletes have vision impairments, with T11 athletes experiencing more severe impairment than T12 ones. Athletes in this category may have up to two guides, though athletes who choose to register two guides only runs with one at any given time in the race -- the guides will swap out part way. This adds an extra layer of teamwork and coordination for those athletes who do choose to use a guide.
* **T46** \- These athletes have upper limb impairments. Typical examples would be an above-elbow amputation in a single arm or below-elbow amputations in both arm. As a result, T46 athletes have to put extra effort into maintaining good balance while running, and also need to be creative with how they grab their drinks and nutrition.
* **T53/54** \- These athletes race in wheelchairs as a result of limb deficiency, leg length difference, impaired muscle power, or impaired passive range of movement. T53 athletes typically have more severe impairments from the waist down than T54 athletes. Because of the speeds they can reach (averaging 30km/hr, and maxing out around 50km/hr on downhills), races can often be strategically more similar to cycling races and running races with an emphasis on effective drafting to conserve energy.

**Athletes to watch**

With 66 athletes across all categories (men/women T11/12, men T46, men/women T53/54), it's a much smaller field than the Olympic marathons. Hopefully that makes it a little easier to follow all five of the simultaneous races as they happen. At the very least, since the wheelchair racers start a little earlier than the other athletes, they'll be well-separated from the rest of the field. For many of the athletes, these games are their first chance at high level international competition since the 2019 World Para-Athletics Marathon Championships in London, which were held as part of the London Marathon ([men's recap](https://www.paralympic.org/news/michael-roeger-unstoppable-london-marathon-debut), [women's recap](https://www.paralympic.org/news/manuela-schaer-makes-it-spectacular-six-london)).

* **Women's T11/12** \- With a 2:54:13 T12 world record set back in December's Hofu Yomiuri Marathon to better her 2:54:22 from February 2020, Japan's [Misato Michishita](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1727761-michishita-misato.htm) has the fastest PB in the field by over four minutes. She is looking to improve over her silver medal from Rio 2016 and win gold on home turf to add to her gold from London 2019. Michishita's closest competition is likely to be Brazil's [Edneusa de Jesus Santos Dorta](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1376430-de-jesus-santos-edneusa.htm), who finished behind Michishita for bronze and silver in Rio 2016 and London 2019, respectively. However, the de Jesus Santos also competed in the 1500m, taking 9th in the final, while Michishita will be coming into the marathon completely fresh.
* **Men's T11/T12** \- If this race had taken place last year, Morocco's [El Amin Chentouf](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1483958-chentouf-el-amin.htm) would be the heavy favorite with gold medals from Rio 2016 and London 2019, with the latter being a 2:21:23 T12 world record. This April, however, Australia's [Jaryd Clifford](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1415994-clifford-jaryd.htm) ""accidentally"" punched his ticket to Tokyo with a [2:19:08 debut marathon](https://runcreature.com/an-accidental-marathon-jaryd-clifford-sets-a-new-world-record-in-his-unbelievable-debut/) while pacing teammate and T46 athlete Michael Roeger. If Clifford has been able to adequately recover from his 1500m and 5000m races, where he earned a bronze and silver, respectively, could he win gold and bring back home a medal of each color from his ambitious triple? Also watch out for 2:22:28-man [Tadashi Horikoshi](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1727717-horikoshi-tadashi.htm) as he tries to win a medal for Japan after finishing just off the podium in Rio 2016.
* **Men's T46** \- Just going by PBs, this race is Australian [Michael Roeger's](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1416017-roeger-michael.htm) to lose. The former middle-distance runner (bronze in Rio 2016) burst onto the marathon scene with at 2:22:51 T46 world record in only his second crack at the distance in London 2019. Since then, he has only gotten faster and bettered his mark to 2:18:53, over six minutes faster than the next-fastest PB, with the pacing help of Jaryd Clifford, mentioned above, this April. That means it will be a tall task for China's [Chaoyan Li](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1589796-li-chaoyan.htm), the reigning Paralympic champion, to defend his title, especially with the current forecast of a [relatively cool (by Tokyo summer standards) and cloudy morning](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/japan/tokyo).
* **Women's T54** \- While she is the reigning Paralympic champion, China's [Lihong Zou](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1597967-zou-lihong.htm) has looked off of her Rio 2016 form so far in Tokyo. She got bounced out of the rounds in the 800m, and only placed 5th, 6th, and 9th in the 400m, 1500m, and 5000m, respectively. That may leave it up to her compatriot, young up-and-comer [Zhaoqian Zhou](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1597948-zhou-zhaoqian.htm) to step up and earn a medal for China. Zhou has already done well so far by winning golds in the 100m and 1500m, as well as a bronze in the 400m. A common theme among the athletes competing in the wheelchair races is competing in multiple events. If you thought Sifan Hassan's 1500-5000-10000 triple last month was impressive, then how about Switzerland's [Manuela Schaer's](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1717308-schaer-manuela.htm) 400-800-1500-5000-marathon quintuple? The reigning world champion is looking to add another medal to the two golds (400m, 800m) and two silvers (1500m, 5000m) she already has won at this Paralympics and improve upon her 6th place from Rio 2016. From an American perspective, no talk about wheelchair racing is complete without mentioning [Tatyana McFadden](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1572938-mcfadden-tatyana.htm). The six-time Olympian hasn't done quite as well as her Rio 2016 100-400-800-1500-5000-marathon sextuple, in which she earned four golds and two silvers, so far in Tokyo, but she is definitely a force to be reckoned with as she looks to upgrade her Rio 2016 marathon silver.
* **Men's T54** \- Reigning Paralympic champion, the Swiss Silver Bullet [Marcel Hug](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1521530-hug-marcel.htm), has had a golden games so far in Tokyo, with wins in the 800m, 1500m, and 5000m. Can he defend his title and make it a golden quadruple? He'll face a tough challenge from American [Daniel Romanchuk](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1662406-romanchuk-daniel.htm), who outsprinted Hug to the finish at the London 2019 world championships. At 23, Romanchuk is a quickly rising talent who became the youngest winner of the wheelchair race in the Boston Marathon in 2019 at the age of 20. Canada's [Brent Lakatos](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/paralympic-games/en/results/athletics/athlete-profile-n1521911-lakatos-brent.htm) will be another strong contender, having beaten Hug at the 2020 London Marathon. He's racked up silvers in the 100m, 400m, 800m, and 5000m thus far, so he's riding that line between being in great form and being a little overcooked with nine races in his arms between the heats and finals.

* Who are you cheering for in these marathons? There's probably someone who wasn't on my radar or left out of this preview due in an attempt to keep the length vaguely manageable.",1630710435

In the shoe shop the salesman told me that the Vaporfly isn’t really suitable for me and my pace (goal time: 3:15:00) and I should try totally different shoes. He gave me the Hoka one one and told me to race in these (better stability, better for “my style of running” etc).

Wondering if anyone has had something similar. 

I woke up the morning after a run and had some pain in my ankle, right under the bone on the outside that only hurts during max eversion (moving the toe outwards from the body. 

I knew instantly it was because I went onto a trail to make a shortcut with my Hoka road shoes and the combination of rocky upwards terrain, high stack height and the end of a long week of running made me a prime candidate for inflaming a tendon. 

Two weeks later it doesn't hurt while running at all (it never hurt while running), only hurts when I go to the very end of my eversion range of motion, and I did a 20 mile hike with 6,000ft of climbing and maybe only 4 steps on the turnaround of switchbacks actually hurt.

209,AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,I'm in need of a new mindset. Really really struggling after a bad performance.,"I put this under health/nutrition because its kind of ""mental health"" related I guess.

Anyways, I got injured February 2021 and was thankful to be able to compete in track, where I actually improved my time in the mile (6:13 -&gt; 5:43) and ended up surprising myself and PRing every race. Over the summer, I was busy with work and camp and kept dealing with minor achilles injuries which was frustrating and unsettling. I decided that I would just be thankful to run mostly or completely pain free. And pre-season went really well! I felt very strong during all the workouts. My goal was not to be a top runner on the team, but to improve and enjoy racing. I've not really seen much improvement since early high school, despite putting in training, but have been patient and just been thankful to run mostly injury free.... 

Anyways, I had my first cross country 5k race a few days ago and it was like a nightmare. After warm ups I noticed my right quad had tensed and I was already dripping in sweat. But I still tried to tell myself I wouldn't PR but it would still be OK. I came through the first mile feeling fine but struggled on the second mile. It got really painful and I had to slow down, then finally I had to stop and walk. The whole last mile was hell. I was getting passed by everybody, and began to walk/jog. I got to the section where my parents were and literally went out of the course to talk to them for like 30 seconds about whether I should drop out or not. Meanwhile, my whole team saw me do this and I was like jogging down the finish line like an idiot, but they still enthusiastically cheered me on, including my crush. I wanted to die right there on the spot. My time.... 3 and a half minutes slower than my PR. I know some of that was from walking and talking to my parents during the race, but still. 

This whole day has been terrible as well as the past couple days. I've been in a horrible mood, trying to avoid everyone on the team out of embarrassment. I can't focus on anything. I was in so much pain during that - how the heck can I do better? I've barely ate all day, which I know is the wrong way to cope. My next race isn't for a while. I have zero confidence for that.

I definitely went out fast but I thought I should've been able to hold it. I ended up walking/running the last mile or so, and stepped off the course for 15 seconds talking to my sister about whether I should drop out or finish (I know, embarrassing, right). Worse, it was the first race of the season and I haven't been able to focus on anything else. I don't know if I even want to race again. 

The next race is a while away and I KNOW I can do better, but I still lack confidence. For some more context, the pace was 10 sec slower than my half marathon race pace. I should've probably dropped out at the 2 mile mark when I began to walk, but I didn't. I am extremely frustrated about my performance and frustrated to be frustrated over this, as it's not like I was in it to win it or anything. I just thought I had trained better for it, that's all. I'm sure some day I'll look back on this race and laugh, but it's just making me sick.

211,AdvancedRunning,Albertos_Dog,"Apple Watch Discussion, and Question: What's the fastest marathon ever recorded on an Apple Watch?","I am constantly back-and-forth over whether I think the Apple Watch is a good running watch. 

On one hand, it basically can't take splits when you're sweaty, only allows the stock Workouts app to use the Always-on-Display (though soon to change), and has thoroughly mediocre (though improved!) battery life.

On the bright side - it finds GPS immensely fast (a huge benefit when you're freezing cold in your driveway), does have solid Stryd compatibility (a major consideration for me), and, with a cellular connection, and allows me to send messages while running (""are you already at the track?"" or ""I'm running five minutes late"").

There's my mini review (happy to field any specific questions for those on the fence). I ran my half-marathon PR in a Series 3, and it actually went over pretty well... though the race was basically out-and-back on Lakeshore Drive, so basically no room to mess up GPS tracking, no matter the device. I also ran the Austin Marathon in the same Watch, and found its performance to be mediocre - it totally bungled my HR, and was off of the mile splits after the first 5K (recording a total distance of 26.8, which isn't woefully terrible, but probably not correct, either).

I've tried more or less every iteration, and think the Series 6 is certainly a more than capable (if imperfect) device. I likely won't upgrade to Series 7, though I will admit I've said that, well, most years.

Anyway! Now my question, purely out of curiosity. Does anyone know who has run the fastest marathon in the Apple Watch? I actually saw some track athletes (sprint events) wear it during Tokyo 2020, but didn't notice any distance runners with one. I looked through some photos of the 2020 Trials, and while I am sure that at least someone was wearing one, I didn't find it.

It looks like my Garmin Forerunner 225 is giving up the ghost after seven years of service. I am in the market for a new GPS watch and would love some recommendations from those who keep up with this stuff.

Some relevant characteristics:

* I'm really just looking for something that can tell me how far I've run and how fast. I don't need music function or even optical HR in the wrist. 
* I've used Garmin stuff in the past but I'm not particularly brand loyal. 
* My old Forerunner had good basic functionality, but there were a few design flaws that bugged me over time. Notably, the cord would consistently fail after a few years (the plastic casing would wear out due to mechanical stress and then the wires would fray through), and getting the watch to connect with the cord cradle was sometimes made difficult because of poor design.
* I don't need any features I won't use, but I also don't want to wind up needing another new watch in two years. I don't mind paying for a quality product that will last.

215,AdvancedRunning,jimi_hendrisk,help needed for my training plan!,"Hi!

I'm a guy, 36. I'm going back to running after a while without running seriously. My long-term goal is to get ready for ultras. I'm not a particularly good runner, but I really enjoy it and I want to get better.

These are my best times (all in 2018):

* Marathon: 3h 17mn (with 230m elevation)
* 10k: 41mn-ish
* 5k: 19mn 57s (YAY! :D)

I'm currently slowly ramping up my weekly mileage, with 4 runs a week:

* Monday: ""long run"" (not exactly a long run at this point while I'm still ramping up)
* Tuesday: ""long run"" (twice the distance as Monday, and same remark as above)
* Thursday: speed work (unstructured fartlek at this point)
* Saturday: hill work (\~300m elevation so far)

Note: I have a \~120m elevation slope that I have to climb for every single run. It's at the beginning of my run, it takes me \~15 minutes to reach the top of that hill.

I'm at roughly 40 km/week right now. I'm currently increasing mileage by 5\~7% per week, and every third week I'll decrease by 2\~3%. I'll add a weekly 5th, and maybe a 6th run, once my mileage justifies it. I'm in no rush.

I also cycle a fair bit, it's my main means of transportation.

I have a Garmin watch and I always run with a HR monitor. My max HR is \~180 and try to stay below 135\~140 for my long/slow runs.

&amp;#x200B;

So I’m trying other options. I have tried the SIS isotonic which doesn’t need water but the first time I had it on a 16 miles provoking a serious emergency, like looking for the nearest bushes but luckily found a public wc (horrible experience). Second and third time I used had no issues, last time I mixed with a GU w/ caff on a 18 miles run and worked perfectly.

I have heard a lot of things about maurten so I bought some regular and some w/ caff, I’m planning to try then this Sunday on a 20 miles long run, but I’m kind of scared with having another #2 situation.

Does anyone have experience with maurten gel? Should I be worried and plan my route based on wc availability?",1630577032

221,AdvancedRunning,foofoobee,Accelerated training program to get back into race shape in 4-5 weeks?,"Hi all, long story short - I'll now be running a half-marathon race in mid October that I hadn't been training for. My last HM race was back in April and I've just been doing general training since then - following no real structured plan since I hadn't planned on any other races this year. It's mostly been an easy pace long run on Saturdays (anywhere from 15-23 km), an easy 10k recovery run start of the week, a 7-10k tempo run once a week, and then just easy/mid-pace 10ks on 1-2 other days.

The issue is that this routine has been heavily disrupted over the summer with travel and then tendonitis for about 3 weeks in my left foot. So I've lost a good deal of fitness and am just working my way back. My ""long runs"" have been only 12-13 kms lately.

I'm not worried about completing the half-marathon, but I'd like to try to at least be in the neighborhood of my last one where I completed in about 1:49. While I know that's not an amazing time or anything, it's still something I'd really like to shoot for again. Right now I'm sure I'd be way off that mark.

I wanted to know if there's any kind of condensed training plan for someone in my situation to get back into race shape over the next 4-5 weeks, without hurting myself.

For background: I'm 41/M - I typically run 4-5 days a week for a total of 55-60 km. This figure has been impacted greatly by injuries in the last month or so but I am starting to ramp back up again.",1630533494

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is the 200-200-400**.

*History:*

Used by the Northern Arizona Elite team, this workout is intended to keep the speed in the legs and maintain proper form during a marathon cycle.

*What:*

3-4x(200-200-400)

*How:*

Pretty simple. 3 or 4 sets of 200m + 200m + 400m with equal recovery jogs. Run the reps at mile pace. With 2.4-3.2k worth of speed this workout isn't too taxing on top of the heavy mileage of a marathon cycle, but it should let your muscles remember what going fast feels like.

228,AdvancedRunning,I_cut_my_own_jib,"Persistent foot pain (1st metatarsal) after using inserts for a few weeks. Never had an issue before the inserts, and looking for advice","Went to see a Physio about 2 weeks ago regarding chronic shin splints, and he suggested that I try a medium-range generic shoe insert, as he believed that the pronation of my feet were causing the stress on my shins, and the inserts would distribute the load more vertically down my shin.  We scheduled a followup but I'm having issues now and my appointment is still a few weeks out and I'm not sure what to do.

I started by just running the last mile of my runs with the insert in, except for my long run.  After a week I didn't feel any issues so I ran some short runs with the insert in, no issues whatsoever.  This past Sunday I decided to run my easy 4 mile run with the inserts in.  Felt fine during the run.  Afterwards, however, my right foot hurt a decent bit along my first metatarsal.  I could feel it when walking around the rest of the day, and a tiny bit the next day.  I chalked it up to one of those come-and-go injuries that happen all the time and are gone the very next run.

Monday was a day off, and today I ran 5 with the insole in, and towards the end of the run my foot was hurting in the same spot.  After the run this morning my foot has been aching all day, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Im leaning towards taking time off until maybe Saturday, but regardless of time off, should I call it quits on the inserts?  I've never had an issue with my feet in my life, and I'm at least slightly skeptical the inserts are good for me because I have an extremely high arch (I've always heard inserts were more for flat footed people).

Any advice?  Should I take time off?  Should I keep with my training but ditch the inserts?  I don't want to go to my physio appointment in a few weeks with a totally new injury, and this has got me pretty down in the dumps to be honest. 🙁",1630453091

234,AdvancedRunning,Sloths4sloths,Boston bound or bust?,"I qualified for Boston at Chicago 2018. I ran a 3:14:55 on consistent but low mileage training. I ran about 35-40miles/week and completed 13,15,20, and 18 mile long runs in the 8 weeks leading up to that marathon. 

I've been training for Boston since December 2019. During 2020 I had a great build up of 45 mile weeks until the pandemic hit and I cruised at 30-35miles/week for the rest of the year with minimal breaks. This year I ramped up my training. From January to May 2021 I was hitting 50miles/week and running one workout per week. These were some of my best tempos and fastest splits in workouts since college (I ran D1 back in the 2000s and i'm in my 30s now). In May I strained my groin and since then my body has fallen apart. I developed a deep pain in my right hip and achilles tendonitis on my left leg. I was running through the pain, but my achilles on my last 13 mile long run was pretty painful, like a 6-7/10. Almost two weeks ago I was doing a recovery run and my right calf seized up. It was immediate and I couldn't put any weight on my toes. So yea, I have three injuries. My physical therapist said I have to wait until I can do a SL heel raise with no pain. I'm still waiting on that. While I can't run right now, I am biking or swimming 45-120min/day.

**Training**

 In October 2019, my friend asked me to do a half marathon scheduled for November 2019. So I started running again after a long hiatus due to injury. I didn't end up doing the race. 

However,  I ended up running a 10k in January 2020 and finished around 47:44. 

I  continued training following different training plans like the dynamic training plans on MapMyRuns for the half marathon and Garmins Heart Rate beginner plan for HM. This usually got me somewhere between 15mpw to 35mpw doing base building, tempo runs, intervals, etc. Looking back on it now, I felt like my training was all over the place and I was not really improving. 

Then in March 2020, my quad started acting up after running downhill. I took a month off and just crossed-trained and focused on cross training such as cycling and elliptical.  However, the gym membership was a bit too pricey so I stopped doing that after the free trial. 

It wasn't until April 2021 where I dedicated myself to base building.  I pulled up a base building plan from high school that takes me from 15mpw to 60mpw in 13 weeks. This looks like the following (15, 20, 25, 15, 25, 20, 30, 25, 40, 35, 50, 40 and 60) 15mpw and 20mpw had two rest days and 25+mpw was only one rest day.  Almost all my running was at an easy pace in Zone 1 or Zone 2 of my Heart Rate Reserve. I stuck to this for about 10 weeks.  Pace wise this translates to about 9-11 minute miles depending on how hot it is outside. 

During the middle of week 10, I went on vacation and ended week 10 at 25mpw instead of 50 mpw. I found it difficult to get back on track. I feel like mentally I just wasn't there, my mind was still on vacation. I decided to take another easy week at 25mpw. 

At this point, Pfitz 60 mile base building plan, 38 mpw to 60 mpw over 10 weeks didn't seem so intimidating. So far I have been following the plan sticking to general aerobic and endurance % of HRR guidelines. Pace wise, I am running a little faster now depending on the heat ranging from 8-11min/mile pace. I do try and treat the endurance workouts as progressions and end the last quarter or third of the workout at a higher % of HRR. 

However, nearing the end of week one, I got an itch to race and test my summer fitness. I ran a 5k time trial about on 28 July 2021 in 22:00mins but doing a solo TT just isn't the same as a race. So I found Sunrise Stampede which would take place towards the end of week 2. I had a 7 mile General Aerobic workout scheduled that day and figured I could race and just do a cooldown to hit my mileage for the day. I figure if I am going to race I might as well do it early in the building phase. 

I used the 5k TT as a reference pace for this 10k using Jack Daniel's VDOT calculator which had me at 7:21min/mile for a 10k. 

Other than that I didn't do any race specific workouts leading up to this 10k. This is my second 10k ever so it's not really something I am familiar with and would love to hear recommendations for the future. 

**Pre-race**

I woke up drank two (2) cups of water and ate a banana. I arrived to the race location about twenty (20) minutes before the start time. Check in was fast. I did a quick seven (7) minute warm up I follow along like I would for my usual runs. Then I jogged over to the start line with about 5 mins to spare, did about five (5), one hundred (100) meter strides. Then the starting time was delayed about ten (10) minutes. So I tried my best to easy my nerves waited a few minutes before doing some more strides. I tell myself to stick to my reference pace of 7:21min/mile and if I feel good run faster. 

**Race**

The gun goes off, I feel fantastic. 

**Mile 1**) 

The race starts off with a one mile loop before turning into an Out and Back. I go around the crowd tightly grouped together in front of me. I am about half a mile in when I look at my watch and notice I am on pace for a 6:20 first mile. Instantly, I thought to myself, no way I feel that good. So I try my best to adjust and reign myself in. I somewhat manage to do that and drop my pace down to end the first mile at 6:48. I do feel like I am breathing pretty hard. My legs feel light and my shoulders feel relaxed. So I start thinking I can maintain around here. A the end of the loop I can see, the leaders are way up front, no way I am catching them. At this point, I am somewhere in the top 20 and feeling comfortable. 

**Mile 2**) 

I keep telling myself I should be aiming closer to 7min/mile. So I try to readjust my pace again but am struggling to get a feel for it. Maybe I've been too reliant on my Heart Rate Training. The pack I am running with is starting to slow down. Thankfully I readjusted my pace and didn't implode. 

**Mile 3**)

I feel good, I feel light, I feel like I can start catching up to people in front of me.  This is when the pack starts thinning out. The pack I was running with starts slowing down below 7min/mile pace. So it's time for to start catching up to people in front of me. I dropped down to about 6:51 pace.

**Mile 4**)

On the fourth mile I regret my decision to catch people so soon. I could have gone a more relaxed pace. I think t the gap between me and the next person was too big at this point in the race and when I ran out of people to catch up to and I lost a bit of motivation here. I just tried to maintain my pace after I ran out of people to catch up too. I lost sight of the people in front of me. 

**Mile 5**)

During this portion of the race, I feel like I  gained some ground on the people in front of me, I can see them again. I am motivated again but I start feeling heavy at this point. I keep telling myself to ""Run tall, run strong, breathe easy"" one of my personal mantra's. 

**Mile 6**)

I am within striking distance of passing someone again but it doesn't come as easy as it did earlier in the race. I pass the person in front of me on a slight uphill, with about what I think is a mile in race left.. 

**Last 0.2**)

Then on the final stretch the last person I passed catches up to me and then proceeds to surge past me. I am barely holding it together as I cross the line and finish at what feels like a jog. 

**Post-race**

I congratulate the guy I ran the last mile with. If he wasn't there I am pretty sure my last mile would have been slower.  I grab some of the sliced oranges and bottled water. Then I go do a ten (10) min cool down jog and stretch. Check out my splits and wish I didn't go out so fast and I kept a more consistent pace through out the race. Then think about again and I am just happy. Last time I did an actual 10k race it was 47:44 back in Jan 2020 so it's been over a year since my last race. So overall, I am satisfied with this result and hope I can stay consistent and healthy.

I am going to continue to base build. I have a half marathon scheduled on Nov 7th. which will be my second HM. Although, my first one was around 10 years ago so it probably isn't the best reference. So I plan on looking at Pfitz for key workouts a few weeks before the race and doing an actual taper. From there I plan on picking a Pfitz marathon training plan. I am eyeing the OC Marathon in May 2022 which will be my first marathon so I am excited.

I spent most of this past year base building. I am currently base building up to 60 miles using Pfitz. I am on week two (2) and wanted to use this race as a fitness check. So I wasn't doing any race specific training. However, I did a 5k time trial about a month ago in 22:00mins. So I used that as a reference pace for this 10k. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

I woke up drank two (2) cups of water and ate a banana. I arrived to the race location about twenty (20) minutes before the start time. Check in was fast. I did a quick seven (7) minute warm up I follow along to from the Running Channel. Then I jogged over to the start line with about 5 mins to spare, did about five (5), one hundred (100) meter strides. Then the starting time was delayed about ten (10) minutes. So I tried my best to easy my nerves waited a few minutes before doing some more strides. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

&amp;#x200B;

The gun goes off, I feel fantastic. I go around the crowd tightly grouped together in front of me. I am about half a mile in when I look at my watch and notice I am on pace for a 6:20 first mile. So I try my best to adjust and reign myself in. During the second mile, I tell myself I should be aiming closer to 7min/mile. Then on my third mile, I feel good, I feel light, I feel like I can start catching up to people in front of me. On the fourth mile I regret my decision. On the fifth mile, I am motivated again, I am within striking distance of passing someone again and I do. I feel terrible. Then on the last 0.2, I am barely holding it together as I cross the line. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulate the guy I ran the last mile with. I grab some of the sliced oranges and bottled water. Then I go do a ten (10) min cool down jog and stretch. Check out my splits and wish I didn't go out so fast and I kept a more consistent pace through out the race. Then think about again and I am just happy. Last time I did a 10k it was 47:44 back in Jan 2020 so it's been over a year since my last race. So overall, I am satisfied with this result and hope I can stay consistent and healthy.

* **Name:** Twilight 5000m
* **Distance:** 5000m
* **Time:** 0:19:26

* Age: 28

* Current MPW + pace: 55mpw 4wk/avg || ~8:00-8:30 GA, 7:10-7:30 LR, 5:25-6:00 VO2 max, 6:30-40 LT

Started running again in February after about six months of zero mileage. Got up
to 30mpw average by the end of May, ran 35-45 with average 37/wk June through
end of July, then kicked it up a notch and managed an average of 55mpw in August
to date.

I've been badgering all of you for feedback on 5K training for weeks, so it's
only proper I finally race one. My fitness is about where I expected it to be,
my race performance was not.

I made a race plan, completely ignored it, and blew up. Gory details below.


### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Sub-19 | *No* |
| B | PR | *No* |
| C | Race Smart | *No* |
| D | Finish | *Yes* |

### Splits

??? - I didn't touch my lap button during the race, but they were giving us
elapsed time at the quarter mile / start line. I remember coming
through 400m in 81 and one mile in 5:51.

### Training

I have been v. loosely following Pfitz's 45-55mi 5K plan with extra mileage and
workouts run by my local running store. I generally take Monday as a rest day
for mobility and PT work and run every other day.

Last four weeks' speed workouts:

1. 12x400, 75s rest: 81-85 (1 @ 75)
2. 6x1mi, 2:30 rest: 6:24, 6:03, 6:09, 6:12, 6:14, 6:20
3. 2 Sets 6x400, 60s rest between intervals + 400m jog between sets: 85-89
4. 8 x 2' 10k pace, 1' MP

Sunday Long Runs have been 15 to 18mi averaging 7:30-7:40. Outside of a
4mi mid-run tempo splitting 7:06/6:58/6:52/6:44, these have mostly been steady state
or mild progression runs.

The rest of week is filled with GA (T/Fr/Sa) and recovery runs.

### Pre-race

Ran Wednesday's workout -- the 12x400 above -- too hard but otherwise had a
relaxed week and felt confident and well-rested going into the race.

Got to the track to watch and cheer on the earlier heats. With a half hour
to go, got in a 2.5mi warm up jog and a couple of race pace 200s and 100m strides
to loosen up.

Some unforeseen rain aside, we had the best August weather for a race a New
Englander can ask for, with temps in the high 60s.

### Race

I have, and seemingly always have been, a workout hero. I have a great block of
training, go into a race thinking I'm set to PR, then go out too fast, blow up,
and limp it across the finish line. I think if I were smarter I would long ago
have looked at my performances through the years, seen the events I excel at,
and decided to gut it out at longer events where you have a better chance of
recovering from pacing mistakes early on, but no, I stick by 5K like a scorned lover.

This race continued that streak.

My heat had an 18:30 and 19:00 pacer; I lined up at the farthest end of the
start knowing I would be on the slower end of the heat. Race official informs us
it's a 440yd track, but they'll be shouting out the elapsed time at each 1/4
mile to help us pace. Checked my laces one last time. We start, I settle in a
couple spots behind the 19' pacer.

We get through 200 in 40-something, and come through the quarter in 81. Pacer
keeps going. Remind myself my race plan was to come through 400 no faster than
93 and do everything in my power to negative split. Ignore my better judgment
and convince myself it'll be fine, there's plenty of time to slow down and
recover a bit during the race.

1600m down in 5:51. Try to convince myself it'll be ok. Know in my lungs, if not
my head, that it will not be.

Lose contact with the field somewhere around lap 5. Lap 7-10 are a haze of ""do
not get lapped"" and ""if you DNF you're not even going to be able to sanity check
your workout paces"". Drag it across the line DFL in 19:25.x.

### Post-race

Check in with friends and ask my brother if knew my final 400/200m splits.
Congratulate friend on her win, and head home to pore over data in Golden
Cheetah, as if there's anything more to it than ""Don't go out too fast, dummy"".

## Conclusion

Even having blown up as badly as I did, it's still my 2nd best 5000m time and
run just days after my highest mileage week of all time. I'm confident that with
better pacing and smarter training over the next month I can still squeeze out a
PR at the second race in the series.

Advice for sharpening workouts or adjustment to training encouraged. My takeaways
were to stress longer intervals or race predictor workouts like 4x1mi w.
60s rest and 5x1200 to get better accustomed to the late race fatigue and
improve my ability to quickly lock on to race pace.

244,AdvancedRunning,JamesFattyHarden,How Quick to Return to 60+ mpw,"Hello all, 

I had a very unfortunate last ~4 months where a non-running injury kept me out for 4 weeks and then some family drama and marital porblems kept me from really returning to my previous mileage for the summer. 

Background context: I ran an average of 240 miles per month from Oct 2020 to March 2021 peaking at 72mpw, and averaging about 65mpw from Jan-March. 

Current situation: I have run about 500 miles in May 2021 - August 2021 with only 170 of those miles coming in July and August. I've only averaged 20mpw over the last 12 weeks and 27mpw over the last 18 weeks. I ran 35 miles over 4 days last week and felt pretty good. 

How soon do you think is safe for me to ramp back up to 60+ mpw? I have tentatively planned to increase my mileage like this starting this week.

247,AdvancedRunning,Fourth_Train,Is it possible for me to go from 18:39 to low 17s in one season,"I'm a high school junior (16M). In my first race I just ran 18:39, it was very hot (91°F), and kind of hilly. The 3 weeks leading up to this were my highest mileage weeks and they were 50.9, 52.7, and 55.1. The week of the race I took a break and only did 15 miles. I'm not doing any more aerobic base weeks now that we've started the season. 

My team is not super serious about xc, it's more like the people who want to work hard will have to find time to put in extra work. Our coach has us do ""long runs"" that are like 6-7 miles. Obviously I've done waayyyy more than that, our average weekly mileage for varsity runners is probably like 20-30 miles.

Does anyone have tips on how I can make my training as effective as possible during racing season. And tips for how to really drop my time so I can help my team out at state.

If other prs would be useful, my track times last year were 800m - 2:19, 1600m - 5:01, 3200 - 11:17.",1630304945
248,AdvancedRunning,ROGER_SHREDERER,Why are over-unders never really used in a running training plan? (Or are they?),"Over-unders are often used in cycling training. The definition of them is:

&gt;Over under intervals are structured tempo, sweet spot or threshold intervals** with an anaerobic effort &gt; 120% of FTP (Functional Threshold Power) for 20-180 seconds, at the beginning and end of each interval. After the ""overs"" the athlete returns to the under wattage until the next ""over.""

Now, I do realize that running and cycling differ in that running doesn't have as much surging compared to cycling. However, the main benefit is that over-unders teached your body to process lactate much efficiently, which I would imagine running can benefit from. 

Is there any reason why running doesn't use these workouts more often?",1630293342
249,AdvancedRunning,fifamahemking,How do I effectively reflect on what worked in a build to help plan my next plan?,"Not necessarily looking for an exact answer but even just some good material to help me understand what may have worked and what may not have worked as well in the block.

Back story is I just started running again in March. Did a 18 week build into a half mara and ran 1:37:20 PB

Through my block I hit a 5km PB of 20:45 as a TT, and ran a 44:40 in the race for my 10k PB.

I want to start doing my own programs to give me more purpose in running and I enjoy understanding it.

The half I did was with a coach but the workouts seemed to lack purpose and didn't pair up well with preparing me for future ones to my time goal. It was a good fun interesting program though for my first half in a year. I got through uninjured at about 44km per week and have now lifted to 50km since and felt good.

However, in building my new plan I'm not sure what to look at in order to know what was effective in preparing me for the race and what I can change going forward to trial new ideas from other coaches or what type of athlete I am and what may suit me. I was thinking of doing a plan with each of the main coaches who have written books to help me build my plan eg Hudson, Hanson, Pfitzinger, Daniels, kenovo maybe ect.

I'm a pretty experienced runner, though only through triathlon (17:17 5k, 1:23 half), and have been running trails in the same old pair of Saucony shoes for about five years. They were a very cheap buy at the time, as I didn't know if I'd stick with the trails.

My problem is that they're really, really heavy. I understand that trail shoes are never going to rival my racing flats, but these guys are definitely on the weightier side. It feels like I'm dragging two lumps of rock about on my feet!

Do you have any recommendations for lightweight trail shoes that still have fantastic grip? I wear Nike and Adidas road shoes, but have happily worn Saucony in the past. Are there any that let you skip up muddy hills at a decent pace? Are there any non-spike (my trails have rocks, tarmac and mud throughout) cross country shoes you'd recommend?

Background: 
14m, 9th grade
8th grade prs: 2:20 800, 5:24 mile, 12:06 2 mile. Important note: I didn’t run the 2 mile in track season, so that pr’s around a year old. First race of the season was a week ago, I ran a 12:09 (huge disappointment).
Training:
I run in high school xc, new freshman this year. I’ve been doing about 25-30 mpw with a good amount of speed work and a long run all summer. Long run of 7-8 miles once a week, and strides and form work pretty much every day. Not looking for training advice in this thread, I’m gonna stick to my coach.

Pre-race:

About 40 minutes out we had a 10 minute warmup jog, then a dynamic warmup. 15 minutes out, put on spikes and jog to starting line. 10 minutes out, do some grass strides to work on the start.

Race:

The race started and I was forced to get out hard due to being at a bad position for the first bottleneck. Settled in after around 400m, and held a steady pace for a while. I came through the mile in 5:43. However, I was already quite tired at this point. For the next 1200 meters I was dying, losing ground, and fighting to stay in the race. Note: The leader won by almost minute in 10:28, this was not a close race. Coming into the homestretch I could barely breath, legs were jelly, and I was fighting for every step. 2 people passed me in the last 200 for 12th overall. Top 10 medaled :(. 
Post-race (And Questions):

So obviously I had horrible pacing during this race, so that left me with a couple of questions. (sorry for bad formatting) 
1)How much of an impact could an even split have on my final time? 
2) I’m not a guy with good sprint speed, would it be a good strategy to kick into final gear with like 600 left to try to form a gap before the final stretch? 
3) Knowing my past running, what’s a reasonable goal for the end of the season? (7 weeks out)",1630187512

I want to sign up and just finish a trail 50k/31miles next May (or be overly ambitious with a 100k/60miles in June). The shorter distance has +3000m/9800 feet of evelation and a cutoff time of 12 hours. What milestones should I set along the way to see if I'm going to be prepared? How much vert is appropriate per week? 

The thing is that I'm currently a slow pavement pounder, who doesn't really have enough throttle on trails. Right now I run 70-90k per week at a comfortable (when not tired) pace of 5:37 per k. I'm training for a flat marathon in a month, hopefully with an avarage pace of 5:35 per k. /9min per mile. 

Secondly, I live in a very flat area, where all the runners share 2-3 tiny hills or one set of stairs, in order to do some amount of vert. There are dunes with sand also, yay. That is why I need to know how much hill repeats I should do, it's not like zoning out on a long run. 

Is there an estimation about how much distance and vert I should be accumulating, per week, 5 months or 2 months out from the race? 

Will just running all winter on sand, in the rain, be enough to toughen me up for a spring mountain?

266,AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Crash Training With Frank Horwill,"For those unfamiliar with the late, great Frank Horwill - he was one of Birtain's premiere middle distance coaches in the 60s-90s as the founder of the British Milers Club, and receiving credit for formulating the 5-pace theory. You can find a lot of his work around the internet, but Serpentine Running Club keeps a great collection of [short articles by him](https://www.serpentine.org.uk/pages/advice_frank.html) in an archive.

His work is, for lack of a better word, ""polarizing"" in the sport. It seems that everyone who I have spoken to about him either thinks he's a lunatic, or says that he's brilliant. The reason for this divide is usually because his training philosophy is unreasonably difficult and often looks like an injury waiting to happen. I recommend going through his articles and making an opinion for yourself though. While some may feel little dated now (they *were* written decades ago after all), his writing style is engaging and there's certainly a lot of interesting stuff in there, even if you might not agree with all of it.

One article that I want to ask about specifically is [Double or Quits](https://www.serpentine.org.uk/pages/advice_frank19.html). This article certainly contributes to Horwill's air of lunacy (and was actually the article that made me a big fan of his back when I was in college). Here he posits the idea of ""Crash Training"", described as ""the doubling or even trebling of the training load in quantity **and** quality for a period of not less than two days and not more than seven days, followed by an **equal number** of recovery days."" 

Ultimately, the idea is to induce ""super-compensation"" by very seriously challenging your body and then very seriously resting your body. So what we usually do on a micro scale (workout day, easy day), taken to the extreme. While 7 days straight of super high mileage and/or workouts sounds suicidal, perhaps there is a training benefit to smaller chunks? Other coaches have adopted similar approaches in their training. For all of the Pfitz folks in the group - correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that he has a 10k tune up with a LR back to back. Canova's ""special blocks"" are a similar concept - albeit with the workouts in the same day. Anecdotally, I personally live and die by this method in my training (not that my PRs are worth writing home about...), and have seen great success with frequent use of crash sessions. For reference, mine usually top out at 3-4 days and are done less frequently than Horwill prescribes though..

I will note by the way, that Horwill is not the creator of crash training (he credits Snell actually), but his name seems to frequently come up in discussions of the concept likely because of this article and his reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

So with the background out of the way, some discussion for you all:

\- Have you tried something similar? Do you think that the results were more, or less successful than a more traditional training approach?

\- Is there a physiological argument for Crash Training? What specific benefits does this provide that a workout day - easy day approach would not? Would it elicit any unique training responses that you couldn't get otherwise?

\- Assuming that we can get a benefit - where's the line? Can athletes really expect to double their training volume for 7 days and not get injured? What would be the cut off for ""maximum kill yourself days"" in a row?

\- What's the appropriate way to crash yourself? Frank tells us that it's a bump in intensity, but leaves the door open on the specifics. Should the daily goals simply be climbing to higher mileage? Should it be more explosive work? Do we alternate the types of workouts, or would we receive better super-compensation by stacking similar workouts (i.e. tempos or hills each day vs some combination of the two)?",1630165259
267,AdvancedRunning,ThePeeGod,What to do in a race: Push and Sustain or Sustain and Push?,"Cheers all,

I need an advice for a half marathon I'm attending in 2 weeks. I've only participated to a few races before just to finish, and I'm quite far away from the 'racing mentality'. I train for long distances, so my training is based on low-to-middle effort rather than high effort. I've added a little bit of interval runs to my training for the last couple of weeks and I see to potential in me to push things a little bit hard. My very comfortable pace is 1h50m and I do have the goal of finishing below 1h40m. Yet, I cannot help but wonder if I can manage to pull of 1h30m. I'm aware that there is a huge difference between 1h30m and 1h40m, but I feel like the race mentality is always different. There are also pacers in the race that I could follow, but I couldn't decide what my plans should be. What do you suggest, should I follow 1h30m pacers and see if I can sustain it until the end OR follow 1h40m pacers and push a lot harder towards the end. How would you approach to a race like this?",1630164074

Been using Nike Pegasus 37s since I started running and they've been kinda fine -  maybe a little narrow. However I've never tried anything else or talked to other runners so I don't know what's generally considered good/best and Google is filled with so much conflicting information and marketing BS that I don't know what to believe.

I'm in the process of focusing my efforts on a HM coming up in about 4 weeks - does losing a little of this training volume significantly affect anything?

For the other things I've cut out I had planned a 4×4min interval but I only finished 3, and earlier this week I had a 3×12min threshold but was a little slower on the 2nd and 3rd reps. I know the losses will be minimal, but I'm curious to see what y'all have to say.",1630098374

273,AdvancedRunning,vortex-street,Comparison of marathon programs,"Has anyone here tried a number of the different marathon training programs/philosophies over the years? For example, Pfitz, Hanson's, Daniels, even others like Magness, Canova, etc... I'm currently mid Pfitz 12/70 which has been going well but I've been curious about trying different methods training in the future. I feel like sticking with any of these plans/methods would get you ""good"" results, but for those who have tried several, did you find one that stood out as working the best for you?

It seems to me like one of the main differences is when to hit the speed (faster than threshold) workouts the most. Pfitz seems to add those towards the end of a plan where Hanson's or Canova seem to advocate more general speed work earlier in the plan, working towards more race-pace specific workouts later on. I can see a case for either, but can also imagine they'd lead to two different outcomes from the same athlete.

I gave Magness's book a read years ago when I was 5k training and found it very interesting. Seemed to advocate some less ""basic"" workouts to try and trigger specific stimuli, ex. blend intervals, doing runs at more than ""just"" easy/threshold/interval paces, etc. Has anyone applied his methods to marathon training?",1630062752
274,AdvancedRunning,tommsyeah,What next? Setting goals,"Hi all! 23M here


BACKGROUND:

Been running on and off for 3 years. 5 days ago I ran my first HM (it was awesome!) and ran 1h 40m 56s (4’47” min/km pace).

I ran a negative split. Went out at 5’10”-15” min/km pace. Ran the first 10k in 50’30” (so 5’03” min/km pace) and the last 10k in 45’05” (so 4’30” min/km pace). My last 5k in the race was around 21’30” (4’18/“ min/km pace) and the last km I averaged sub-4 min/km pace. 
Also, I crossed the halfway point in 52’57” meaning that if I hadn’t sped up I would have finished in 1h46min. Ran the second half in 47-48 minutes.

Leading up to the HM, I feel like I trained the bare minimum to do decently. Due to life commitments as well as me wanting to dedicate my time also to other sports (mainly rock climbing) I didn’t follow a training plan and I was never running more than 3-4 times/week in the 3 months leading up to the race. My runs were mostly easy runs (between 5’25-5’50 min/km pace) with some long runs (between 13km and 16km, longest one was 18km) thrown in every week or two. I had never run more than 18km before race day. I did not do intervals/strides/fartleks/hills (aside from a couple interval sessions in the 2 weeks before the race). I did maybe 3-4 tempos (15-18min long ones) in total.

2 months ago I ran a 5K TT to gauge my fitness (hadn’t trained for it though and wasn’t planning on running it, I just felt like it during what was supposed to be a normal run). I ran 20’59” (4’12”/km pace). 


NEXT GOALS:
After the 20’59” 5k in June (my PB in the 5k) and the 1h 40m 56s HM this week, I am wondering what I should aim for next! I would like to work a bit on 5k and 10k times before running another HM. I’m just unsure on what realistic (yet ambitious) goals I could set for myself. 


- As to 10k distance, I am thinking of running a 10k in around 8 weeks from now. What time could I aim for? I ran the last 10k of my HM in 45’05” but I wasn’t pacing myself evenly at all, as I ran a negative split. With 8 weeks of decent training (by which I mean training that also includes some speed work, and hovers around 40km/week) and better pacing, what time could I aim for in a 10k? 

- Also, what about a 5k? Considering I ran 20’59” with no speed training 2 months ago and that now I’m in better shape than I was in June, do you think it would be feasible to attempt a sub-20 min 5k in a few weeks?

&gt;Jake Smith won the Cheshire Elite Marathon on Sunday with an Olympic qualifying time of 2:11 – despite not even intending to finish the race. Smith was acting as a pacer in the race, but opted to carry on past the 25km mark. And it was his first marathon.

&gt; Jake told Runner's World UK that 'not a lot' was going through his head while he ran the race: 'I think I was just enjoying it all too much and helping the guy in 2nd. When I looked at my watch at mile 17 and saw how fast we were still going I knew I had to finish.' 

&gt; 'I just went for it and thankfully it paid off,' he added. 'It’s a long time running and if you’re too serious you don’t run well. So I was just having a good time, trying to stay relaxed.' 

&gt; **Smith’s previous longest distance was 19 miles.** According to his coach, James Thie, he ran the race with little of the usual marathon preparation or race fuel – **taking on no drinks and only one gel.**

Selected quotes from [Run Creature](https://runcreature.com/an-accidental-marathon-jaryd-clifford-sets-a-new-world-record-in-his-unbelievable-debut/):

&gt; Jaryd Clifford never expected to run more than 20 km this past Sunday (25 April). The star 1500 and 5000-metre runner was lining up at Athletics Australia’s so-called Tokyo Qualification marathon in western Sydney, not as a competitor, but as a pacer for his teammate and hero, Michael Roeger. 

&gt; At 36 km, with his legs well and truly feeling the hurt, Clifford thought his job was finally done. He slowed to a walk, and watched as Roeger carried on down the course. He eventually sat down on the ground, and for a moment, even lay flat on his back. But before he could catch his breath, his coach — who had run over to him — was hollering: “What are you doing? You have to finish this now.” And so, without a second thought, he was back on his feet, pounding the pavement, in hot pursuit of Roeger.

&gt; ""I figured I could probably make it that far without doing any specific work. We did one practice session after nationals last week, which was 3 x 2km at 3:15/km average pace. That was the longest workout I did leading up.""

&gt;""In January, I would have done one, maybe two, 30 km runs. But that’s probably the last significant long run I did. I have had some 20km tempo runs at around marathon pace. My weekly mileage recently has been probably on average between 80 to 100 km.""

&gt; ""Another thing that’s notable is the fuelling. I had two sips of Maurten at three points in the race: the 5, 10 and 15 km marks, because Philo was picking up bottles. But after Philo dropped out I didn’t have any sips of anything. I had one gel 20 minutes before the race, not much for breakfast, and that was basically my only nutrition.""

&gt; ""Coming across the finish line was genuinely one of the most insane feelings. I collapsed on the ground and my stomach — my whole body — was shaking and convulsing. It was a mammoth effort just getting there in the last 5km to finish, and then to hear I’d run under 2:20. It was just shock and disbelief. It wasn’t euphoria, it was more like, What just happened? What did I just do?""

---

**The takeaway:**

We shouldn't be surprised that elite middle/long distance runners are capable of amazing performances. Furthermore, we know that most middle/long distance runners are doing similar training, with mileage of up to 160 km / 100 mi.

I like the notion that sometimes we over-think things, that we can over-analyse, over-plan, etc.. In these two instances, with no intention of completing a marathon (and no fuelling/training plan in support), we have seen elite times and performances. In Smith's case, he won the race. In Clifford's event, he set a world record for the [T-12 athletics category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2_(classification)#Athletics).

On the other hand, it makes you wonder the times both could have achieved (and could still achieve... Clifford is competing in the Tokyo Paralympics, in the 1500m, 5000m, and the marathon!), with more specific training and fuelling. Given the times that were achieved, it is clear that both their performance ceilings have yet to be reached.

If anyone has any comments regarding their nontraditional fuelling strategies, I'd be interested to understand how they both managed given their low energy intakes.",1630022854

288,AdvancedRunning,ExcessiveMnmlsm,Fitness level required for Hansons Marathon Method training aiming at sub 3?,"Background: Male, 42 years old, recreational runner for 15+ years.

In 2019 I ran a 3:07 marathon after using the advanced program in Hansons Marathon Method.

I have had som injury problems for the last year so my run fitness is the worst it has been for many years (though I have been doing some really good strength progress during this injury period). Now I am hoping to get back into running and would like to eventually start training for a sub 3 h marathon using the Hanson Marathon Method (HMM).

I wonder if you guys have any idea of what kind of fitness and training foundation is needed for a successful cycle of the HMM advanced program with the goal of finishing under 3 hours?

I know therer are race equivalency charts but since I haven't done any races for quite som time I am looking for other kind of benchmarks like weekly mileage or specific workouts that could serve as motivation and goals for my training.",1629975574
289,AdvancedRunning,AnObscureQuote,Coe's Infamous Rivelin Valley 800s,"Likely popularized from the ""Sebastian Coe Born to Run"" documentary (or perhaps Better Training For Distance Runners by Peter), Seb's 800 meter repeats on Rivelin Valley Road are a bit of a legend. For those unfamiliar, you can find an example of him performing these repeats at about the 20 minute mark of this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5D0XzOcQkM).

Seb purportedly ran 6-8 of these repeats in under 2 minutes each, with limited recovery time between sets (he states that if he caught his dad on a good day, he could squeeze a minute and a half rest). This would be \~3-4 miles at faster than his 2 mile pace, *while running uphill*.

Observations:

\- Seb's form is nearly flawless (for him anyways) despite the gradient and his turnover is still surprisingly high while climbing as well, which I always found interesting.

\- The gradient obviously isn't too steep, but still steep enough that the car climbs over the crest of the hill to meet the camera at 20:35. So we can see that he's not running flat 800s.

Now I personally love of hill running for a variety of reasons, but I'd like to hear from you all:

\- Have you ever tried replacing any of your track workout with long hill repeats? Did you find it useful? 

\- What benefit do you think this specific workout provides over performing the same repeats on the flats (or hot take - would Seb have been faster if he trained on a track)?

\- How often would you perform such a workout compared to a track day? Would you do it all year round?

\- Where are the diminishing returns for this type of training. At 400 meter repeats? 800m? 1600m? Longer?",1629941373

291,AdvancedRunning,e7series,Advice on Half Marathon Plan for March 2022,"32 Years Old, 6'1"" (186 cm), and 170 lbs (77 kgs) 

I started running about 2.5 years ago and have continued to progressively improve upon my PB's

* 10k from 45m04s (May 2019) to 38m04s (August 2021) 
* HM from 1h44m30s (June 2019) to 1h33m57s (August 2019) to 1h28m30s (February 2020) to 1h23m37s (August 2021) 

Before this year's training block, I was not following any training block and just running by feel. Trying to get some long runs in while increasing my pace when I felt like it. However, about 3 months ago I started to follow the Pfitz 18/55 Marathon plan for my upcoming Marathon next month in September where I hope to go sub-3. 

The 10K and HM PB's were set in the middle of my 18/55 Marathon Plan. 

I'm enjoying Pftiz's plan but for my next goal, I would like to go sub 1h20m in the HM and wanted to ask for your advice on what training plan you would recommend. If sub 1h20m is not possible, then sub 1h22m would be great as well. 

* Would prefer a 12 week plan - although I could do a 18 week plan if the first 3 weeks are easy. Seems like Hanson's Beginner HM plan is like this. I will be traveling on Week 16 through 18 of any 18 week training plan
* Due to my schedule, would prefer a plan of maximum 60 mile (100 km) weeks 
* I've really enjoyed the speed training in the 18/55 plan and would prefer a plan that has this - from what I can see, seems like Hanson's plan is like this? 
* I currently own Faster Road Racing by Pete Pfitzinger and have been checking out the 12 week 31 to 47 miles (50 - 76km) plan. Seems like there's a lot of focus on longer LT runs.

### Training
This race was a tune up race I had planned for Week 10 of an 18 week marathon training plan I threw together. Haven't done much speed work or quality tempo runs since I've been trying to add on more mileage and avoid injury. Previous long run before this race was 12 miles and averaging about 25-30 miles per week. Missed like two weeks of training because I got married in July and had my honeymoon.

### Pre-race
Honestly, didn't really know what to expect! Haven't ran in a race environment that I've trained for since high school cross country (7 years ago). Haven't ran two weeks in a row since then either. Starting from scratch basically!
Woke up 1 hours before starting time. Had some fruit and coffee and drove 15 minutes to the starting line to pick up my bib. Did some light jogging and a little stretching to pass the time. Had some pretty big nerves since this was my debut back to running.

### Race
As soon as the horn went off I ran the nerves out. Had a nice jump at the beginning but slowed myself since my race plan was to coast 8 minutes per mile the entire race. My ego was really kicking my ass as other runner were passing me but it was only the first mile and had a long way to go. Felt really strong the first half. My wife and parents came out to support me but must have had problems finding spectator spots since I didn't see them until the turn around at 6 miles. Mile 9 had a huge almost spiral staircase like hill that was a pain to get up. Once I reached the top I pushed myself to try and win back some time which is where I think I made my biggest mistake. The only two people I passed after the hill had caught up and passed me by the start of mile 11. All I could do was feel myself moving slower as they were eventually out of sight. Pretty uneventful last two miles. Passed one other runner on the last mile and tried to leave it all out on the last .1 but couldn't get much out of it.

### Post-race
Finished 12th overall and 1st in age (25-29). Wasn't a very competitive event but I really just wanted under 1:45. That is just where I thought I was physically. For not being my goal race and my first race in years. I was happy with the outcome. I'm not where I want to be but I am where I expected to be. Just going to try and do some real consistent training for the Des Moines Marathon in October.

307,AdvancedRunning,Tremaklus,Really Masters (55+) Breaking 3:00 for the Marathon," 

&gt;I am currently 59 and looking at trying to break 3:00 for the marathon - and actually getting into the award categories at Chicago and Boston next year when I turn 60.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is my (somewhat) lengthy background.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am 6' 1"" and weigh around 157.  Like many here probably did as well, I started as a runner in cross country when I was 12.  I went to a very small school that did not have a track team because we did not have a track (no football team).  Our coach was merely someone who had run before and we had no formal coaching. I did some serious running after I got out of college. In 1987, I had a 17:00 5K pb, and 1:16:53 half marathon pb.  I have always been better at longer than shorter races and can generally maintaining a faster pace at longer distances than my shorter distances would predict.  That same year I ran the Columbus Marathon, but made the rookie mistake of going out at a sub 6:00 pace, died at 20 miles and walk/ran (mostly waked) to a finish in 3:05 and change. After that, life took over and my running took a back seat. Then from 2001 to 2013 I decided I was tired of being so thin (I weighed about 145 at the time). I began seriously lifting weights, got up to as high as 195, and then generally settled around 185. In 2013, I started back up with my running and ran the Columbus Marathon in 2014 with a time of 3:06:59, which I lowered in 2015 to 3:06:07 (53 at the time, averaging around 50 mpw). I ran Boston the next year, but died and the next 1 1/2 years were a waste - I had no energy and could hardly finish long runs. I finally got back on track in 2018, ran the Flying Pig Marathon in 3:09:04, which is a very hilly course. I was doing well and was set to run the Columbus Marathon that fall where I was expecting to finish (based on my training) under 3:05, but the Monday before the race I pulled my left hamstring. That then turned into a sympathetic right hip injury that I stupidly ran through for the next six months.  In May of 2019, I stumbled during a run, jarred down hard on my right leg and - OUCH - my nagging pain in my right hip became a major pain.  
&gt;  
&gt;I could not run at all for the next 4 months.  I slowly worked back up and by early this year was running long runs at an relatively comfortable pace of around 7:45 mpm.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am currently following the Hanson advanced plan in training for the Cincinnati Flying Pig Marathon on October 31.  I am in week 9 of the program and an feeling good that I am in condition for a sub 3:10 even on the hilly course.  The only tweaks I am planning is maybe bumping a couple of the long runs to 18.  My mileage averages around 50 mpw year rounds, I am currently in the 60 mpw range and I don't take days off (I have taking days off).  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is where my questions come in to any 55+ runners that have made it under 3:00.  My plan is to run Chicago in the fall of 2022 with a goal of under 3:00 that should safely put me into the award category (top 5) for the 60-64 age group, and then Boston in the spring of 2023 with a goal of under 2:56 to likely be enough to again be in the award category (top 3) in the 60-64 age group.    
&gt;  
&gt;For my next block - spring of 2022 - should I focus on a half marathon to build up better speed?  Should I do another marathon block to get under 3:05?  Should I look at a Pfitz plan rather than Hanson - in 2014 and 2015 I followed the plan from ""Mastering the Marathon"" by Don Fink - or try something else?  My 5K speed is not good - should I focus on that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",1629826759

I’m training for Wineglass on 10/3. That gives me not quite six weeks of training. Where should i focus my efforts for the next four weeks before taper? Should I be thinking of adjusting my goals?

I’ve been using a modified pfitz 18/55. Peak mileage around 45 MPW with 6 days of exercise but two are non-running for injury prevention. I have crushed the track/speed work and kept up on the long runs (up to 16), though tempos are harder bc of heat. However. I had to take all of last week off to heal some Patella Tendinitis. 

Im getting back up to speed now but likely will be dropping down to one quality workout a week until race week. That brings me to my question: should I focus on just completing my long runs and do my speed work? Or forgo speed work to do the marathon paced long runs (like the 18 mile with 10 @ MP)?

Lastly, should I start reconsidering my goals? This is marathon #3. PB is 3:03 and I am gunning for 2:57 and a BQ.",1629825583

310,AdvancedRunning,-tuna_,How slow is too slow?,"Im training for the 5k and in an effort to increase my weekly mileage I have started doing longer runs. However I live in a very hilly area (\~200 feet of elevation difference from start to finish) and because I'm trying to keep my running at an ""easy"" pace, I aim to keep my heart rate below 140 and stay in a zone where I am able to hold a conversation as I run. The problem is that some of these hills are so steep that just walking up them takes me to a 150 heart rate. (partially because of the heat)

I have read that staying at a conversational pace and in zone 1-2 of your heart rate is optimal for a base training phase, but I have also read that it is possible to run too slow during your easy runs so I assume by walking every uphill and waiting to recover below a 140 HR before I start running again is undermining my attempts of increasing my aerobic capacity on my longer runs. 

So what should I prioritize, heart rate, or running continuity? 

And is walking okay if I'm heart rate training? I mean my heart and lungs don't know if I'm running or walking, so is it all the same?",1629790862

\### Training

This race was a tune up race I had planned for Week 10 of an 18 week marathon training plan I threw together. Haven't done much speed work or quality tempo runs since I've been trying to add on more mileage and avoid injury. Previous long run before this race was 12 miles and averaging about 25-30 miles per week. Missed like two weeks of training because I got married in July and had my honeymoon.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Honestly, didn't really know what to expect! Haven't ran in a race environment that I've trained for since high school cross country (7 years ago). Haven't ran two weeks in a row since then either. Starting from scratch basically! 

&amp;#x200B;

Woke up 1 hours before starting time. Had some fruit and coffee and drove 15 minutes to the starting line to pick up my bib. Did some light jogging and a little stretching to pass the time. Had some pretty big nerves since this was my debut back to running.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

As soon as the horn went off I ran the nerves out. Had a nice jump at the beginning but slowed myself since my race plan was to coast 8 minutes per mile the entire race. My ego was really kicking my ass as other runner were passing me but it was only the first mile and had a long way to go. Felt really strong the first half. My wife and parents came out to support me but must have had problems finding spectator spots since I didn't see them until the turn around at 6 miles. Mile 9 had a huge almost spiral staircase like hill that was a pain to get up. Once I reached the top I pushed myself to try and win back some time which is where I think I made my biggest mistake. The only two people I passed after the hill had caught up and passed me by the start of mile 11. All I could do was feel myself moving slower as they were eventually out of sight. Pretty uneventful last two miles. Passed one other runner on the last mile and tried to leave it all out on the last .1 but couldn't get much out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Finished 12th overall and 1st in age (25-29). Wasn't a very competitive event but I really just wanted under 1:45. That is just where I thought I was physically. For not being my goal race and my first race in years. I was happy with the outcome. I'm not where I want to be but I am where I expected to be.

### Training
I am in a 5k cycle with some goal efforts comings up in September. Original goal of the cycle was to try and get under 15. Things were really clicking through mid-July and then some pretty bad patellar tendinitis set me back for a bit and, when combined with some pretty humid/hot weather, shattered my confidence. Workouts and mileage have been sketchy the last month with some going great and others not going as planned. I also tried a 3000 TT on the track 2 weeks ago and my knee locked up and I had to call it quits after 800 or so. All-in-all confidence hadn’t been great but I felt a consistent week or two of training and decided to give another TT a shot. 

### Pre-race
I really wanted to take the pressure off for this rust buster given the above context and because it was the first time doing a race effort since my 5k PR back in May. The dew point was also in the mid 70s and I have trouble in the heat so I decided to stay off the track and run on a course with about 90 feet of elevation loss. I also decided to have some more fun with it and try to take it out HARD and see if I could fight through some mental demons.

I woke up at 2:45 AM, crept downstairs so I wouldn’t wake up the kids, pounded some coffee, grabbed my backpack and headed out the door. The walk down to the trail is about 5 minutes so I just listened to some tunes and tried to chill. By the time I got down there I was already pretty sweaty so I pounded a Gatorade and started my warmup. 

2 miles easy, 1 uphill on the course and then 1 back down went by quickly. Before I knew it I found myself changing into my Next%2s, taking off my headphones and heading back uphill into the night to finish my warmup. I clicked off a 5:44 mile, walked a bit, did 3 75m or so strides continuing up the gradual incline of the course and then finished off my warm up with 200m or so at 3-5k pace. I walked the remaining quarter mile or so up to the start line, calmed myself down and got my farming workout programmed to take 3 1k splits ready before heading out.

### Race
I hit the start button on my watch and took off hard. I knew right away I was probably a bit quick but I avoided the urge to look at my lap pace until I knew I was about 400m in. Shit… 4:17 pace. Right at that point I throttled but just as the course flattened out for the next 400 meters or so. I cruised through 800 meters and just focused on staying relaxed before the course dropped off again for the next 200 meters. My watch beeped 4 times and then buzzed and when I looked down at my last split I saw 2:52. A bit faster than I wanted. 

I tried to just focus on staying mechanical and zoning out for the next 1k. I don’t think I even looked at my watch. This portion was a long straight with a gradual decline that went under a few bridges. It is one of my favorite sections of the trail. It was around this time that I felt myself seriously starting to feel the humidity. I cruised by the mile marker and knew I was 400 out from the next split. I went up and over a bridge and the beeping started again. Then a buzz. 3:04. I had slowed down way more than I should have.

I threw in a surge to try to get back on pace and started looking at my watch every 50 meters. I saw the avg. lap pace drop from 5:20 to 5:10 to 5:00 to 4:50 before finally settling in at 4:47. I wasn’t really tying up but I just didn’t really have the will power to go any faster than that. I was stupidly staring at my watch a ton and kind of took my mind out of the effort a bit more than I should have. I passed some weird dude walking down the trail towards me smoking a cigarette (remember this is like 3:45 AM). I thought about how weird he must think I am grunting loudly, sweating like an animal running 4:45 mile pace down a commuter bike path in the middle of the night wearing nothing but half tights. The smoke made me gag. Before I knew it I was 200 meters out and I just focused on maintaining control and finishing with solid form. No real kick to be found. I heard the final beeps and the buzz and stopped my watch a moment later. I saved the activity, pulled the splits up and did the math in my head and calculated it out to 8:55.5

### Post-race
Not great. Not terrible. Pretty much what I was hoping for. I cooled down 2 miles and walked home just as my 4 year old son was waking up. We snuck passed my sleeping wife and he chilled in the bathroom with me while I took a shower and I told him about the race. We then snuck downstairs and made pancakes.

316,AdvancedRunning,NotAtTheTable,Question around fitting a half marathon+vacay into a pfitz 18/55 marathon training plan,"Hi all,

So I'm running the San Jose rock&amp;roll half marathon on October 3rd, while also training for the Dallas Marathon on December 12th (the primary goal). This would put the half marathon on the sunday of week 10, which is a 54 mile week consisting of 

27-Sep	M	Rest

28-Sep	T	Rec + Sp 7 w/ 6 x 100 strides

29-Sep	W	MLR 12

30-Sep	Th	Rest

1-Oct	F	LT 10 w/ 6 @ 15K to HMP

2-Oct	Sa	Rec 5

3-Oct	Su	LR 20

First question, how would you shuffle around the week to best service the half marathon (read: not get hurt) while still racing this a bit as a test of fitness. Could I just do the runs as prescribed, skip the taper and then maybe have an easier week after to adjust as little as possible?

Second question is how would you load balance the week after, which currently consists of:

4-Oct	M	Rest

5-Oct	T	Rec 6

6-Oct	W	MLR 14

7-Oct	Th	Rec 6 

8-Oct	F	Rest

9-Oct	Sa	Rec + Sp 6 w/ 6 x 100 strides

10-Oct	Su	MP 16 w/ 12 @ MP

I'm thinking I should be able to just jump back in (maybe?) or maybe cut out the Wednesday 14 miler and just focus on some recovery miles or something? (I'll also be on vacation so cutting out the 14 miler would be something my wife would be excited about).

Okay one more question - should I potentially swap the sunday runs for these two weeks? Replace the 16 w/12 @ marathon pace with the half, and then do a 20 miler after I get back home?

I'm probably overthinking this a touch - two weeks where I'm still getting good mileage in and racing isn't ""lost fitness"" but I think you lot are pretty bright, so I wanted to get your thoughts on how to best optimize the plan.

On this flip side, we have LetsRun (speaking specifically of the boards, obviously). There’s some immense abrasiveness there, and you often have to wade through pages of negativity/toxicity to get to the good content… but when you find it, I think it’s much better - LRC has input from athletes and coaches of the highest caliber, and has some immensely good threads on training from runners who are seeking to be HS/college champions, professional runners, OTQers, etc.

322,AdvancedRunning,newguy3912,Question about returning from injury..,"My question requires a little back story.. so here goes.  

About 3 months ago, I was at peak fitness.  I trained super hard for a half marathon and managed to run a 1:22 (\~6:13/m).  This was the culmination of my pandemic training program, which allowed me to train basically everyday (and on some days - twice a day).  This is a VERY fast time for me.  I am also an avid cyclist and (for those who are in that world) had an FTP of \~ 4.1w/kg.

Anyway, in mid-June I got hit by a car while riding my bike that resulted in a broken collarbone that which surgery to repair.  I had to take 2 months completely off while the shoulder healed.  I started running two weeks (Aug 9).  Ran 3 miles at 8min/mile and was more sore the next day than after I ran my 1:22 HM.  I'm slowly getting back into the flow of training... but my question is, what is a reasonable time frame to return to my prior fitness?  

In my head, I had a goal of targeting a 1:22 HM in April 2022... so that's 8 months of training.  Too conservative.. too aggressive?  Those who have been through this., any training tips would also be appreciated.",1629733802

I guess I've fallen into the trap of trying to throw too many elements into my training such as incorporating form pointers from dozens of youtube videos and perhaps mentally wearing myself out from trying to run a certain way.  

For example, still don't know what the optimal arm carriage is (I'm 6'1 and have thin lanky arms) and worried that my easy day pace is slowly drifting into the 9-930 range whereas in all my prior training blocks (even with some at altitude) my easy/recovery pace rarely drifted beyond 830.

# Background

My (22 m) background in running is very minimal, but in 2020 my farthest distance was a half marathon. I had to cut it short in 2020 because I started to develop ITB syndrome. I made it a goal for 2021 to come back strong and develop a more efficient running gait. I didn't really have any sights on racing in this marathon but it was definitely in my bucket list. I continued to follow my habit of running 3x a week and up to 5x a week, and fell in love with this hobby.

# Training

My first run of 2021 was in April. The first long run was of the yearabout 10 km and that was already miserable for me. I slowly built up my mileage each week, following about the 10% rule, and my long runs became longer and longer by \~2-3 km each run. Things were going quite well for me. However, I never incorporated any strides, fartleks, etc. because I wasn't familiar with these at the time. Most of my runs were at consistent paces throughout, but I knew well enough that some runs during the week should be faster, and the majority are steady easy (hard days hard, easy days easy). Easy runs were definitely not kept easy lol, ran them at about \~5:30 km/min pace. But they did feel easy on my body. I started from 17.3 km/week, and my peak was 105.2 km/week (96.6 km and 84.1 km the previous weeks). I had plans to hold the 105 km for another 2 weeks, however, I suffered a calf (soleus) strain with about 5 weeks left until my planned race date. To keep it short, possible sources of injury are over-training, lack of sleep, and a squishy, high stack height shoe I was using on a very bouncy treadmill. I put the excuses aside and worked my butt off to rehab as safely but quickly as I could. I cross-trained with swimming and biking during my off-time, and come the 2nd week, I was back on my legs with very light running. I was surprised I was able to come back this quickly, but there was still some lingering pain so I continued my rehab with some running. I managed to bump my training and taper to 80 km/week, trusting that my aerobic abilities were well trained before my injury.

# Pre-race

Lots and lots of excitement! Planned start time was 7am. Set my alarm for 4am, didn't wake up until 5am. I ate 1/2 cup oatmeal and a banana. During the week before race day, I ate my normal meals, but ate lots of pasta and followed Coach Kyle's taper and carb-loading plan. I didn't have much water, maybe less than 1 L. I did a 1km shakeout and ate some candy 20 minutes before go time.

# The race

I was very surprised with my first split. I realized that was too fast for me because I haven't trained much at that pace. Heck, my plan was to split 4:45 km/min for my race. I stepped it back a bit and found myself even splitting 4:25-4:30. This is when I decided that this is what I'm going to hold and stick with how my body is feeling. During the race, my body and mental was holding up great. I had my uncle supporting me on a bike so he passed me the bottles. My first drink (water) was at about 2 km and I continued with sips at about every 4 km, sometimes at shorter intervals. I switched to Gatorade at 10 km. First nutrition (sour watermelon gummies) was taken at 8 km. I used gummies because I was too cheap to buy and train with gels. Nutrition plan was to take in carbs every 5-6 km afterwards. My memory is a bit short on the exact details. I started to take in my uncle's gels (Huma) at kilometer 25. I didn't experience much cramping throughout the run. I had browsed on Reddit that the ""wall"" is at about the 30 kilometer mark, and I was very wary of that haha. Mediocre fatigue was felt  at kilometer 34, and that's where you can see in the splits I was starting to hurt - I couldn't take my mind off the finish line!

# Post-race

I was so so so thrilled with how the race went. My mind was flooding with thoughts and emotions because this has been a rollercoaster for me. Running has carried me through some hard times so I'm very grateful I was able to achieve this. I wouldn't say that my body was absolutely destroyed, just some minor stiffness throughout my legs. However, I have a baseball sized blister on my heel. Very excited for continuing with this hobby. :)",1629677276

Today I had a 10k and went out too fast - when I got back to my car my CGM showed I’d been high sugar throughout. This wasn’t my only problem, but was definitely one of them. I find this especially hard in the morning, because if I take too much of a bolus I know I’ll be hitting a low. But if I eat too much my belly will be full and impact a hard effort.

Anyone here who’s had to develop strategies for this?",1629649469

336,AdvancedRunning,j_hx_w,Reacclimating to running as an ex-runner,"Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. I was a decent (for my state) distance runner in high school (4:44 1600, 16:19 5k), but then I stopped running after I graduated. This year, almost 10 years since my last high school XC race, I started to run again. I was running 1-3x a week for 4-8 miles per run, around 8:00 min/mi pace. I saw very gradual improvement in that my pace started getting quicker and I was able to incorporate some long runs too. 

Now 3 months of running have gone by and one day I decide to push the pace on 12 mile long run, and I end up averaging 6:45 min/mi. I was really shocked because I never imagined I would ever get back into semi-decent running fitness again, especially so soon.

I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience before? Is there any research that indicates people who’ve achieved certain levels of fitness at some point in the past can regain that fitness faster than someone who has not held that level of fitness before?

And for more context, in the 10 years I stopped running, I’ve been relatively healthy (+15lb my high school weight, mostly muscle) but have done no cardio exercise, only light weightlifting (~3 years) and boxing (~2 years).

Final thoughts: after that 12 mi long run, my legs were extremely sore for a few days and my IT band, arches, achilles, and shins were very irritated. I was probably close to getting injured, so I guess I find it surprising that my mind was able to push myself to go at a pace/distance that my physical body clearly wasn’t ready to do. I wonder if this is another common phenomena ex-runners experience: your mind thinks you’re still the fast runner you used to be, so it defaults to pushing your body at your old pace?",1629635190

338,AdvancedRunning,djc0,Running while dealing with ongoing chemo … looking for shared experience and training advice/adjustments,"I know this might be a bit of an unusual post. But I’ve been on chemo/immuno drugs for the past ~2 years now, along with a stem cell (aka bone marrow) transplant last year. But throughout working hard to keep my running up when I can. 

It’s hard to find people going through similar experiences and how they adjust and cope. Recovering from the more serious treatment aside (the SCT was about 6 months), the side effects from some of the drugs/drug combinations have played havoc with my max HR, overall HR, oxygen transport/breathing, recovery/sleep … not to mention overheating (even when the weather is cold). Training has had to change (along with my expectations). 

For me I’m managing lenalidomide, daratumuamb, and dexamethasone on a daily/weekly basis. Before all this I was running 3000-4000km per year and have done 15 marathons. Losing all that base was hard but I’m so far back up to over 1000km for the year so far. My easy pace before was around 5:45/km with average HR 140’ish bpm, now ~8:00/km at ~155bpm. Max HR changes depending on drugs and dosage, but can go from ~180bpm to 165bpm over the course of a month. It’s weird. 

**I would love to hear other’s experiences and how you adjusted and changed in your training.** And what you accomplished in spite of the challenges especially.

### Final time: 18:15

The Opaskwayak Indigenous Days Foot race is an annual race held during Opaskwayak Cree Nation's annual festival in northern Manitoba, Canada.  It's a small, very loosely organized race, but because the race is sponsored by the band, there are insane cash prizes to be won, and for the past few years I've been running in this race annually as a side hustle.  I won the 2018 and 2019 races (2020 was cancelled), and at that time the race format was a road race of about 14 km in length.  This year, likely because the festival was sort of thrown together last minute, they held it on the local track and made it a 4800m race, and instead of a mass start, they did separate heats for age groups and genders (under 17, 18-50, 50+, male and female).  First prize for this race was a cool $800.

### Training
I didn't do any specific training for this race, I'm currently in the middle of a home brewed Chicago Marathon training plan, running 55-65 mpw with one weekly workout (some variation of either lactate threshold intervals, critical velocity intervals, or a tempo progression run starting at marathon pace and finishing at 10k pace), one stride session, and a long run, running 7 days a week.  Lately been running one or two days of doubles just due to family and other commitments.  I wasn't even sure that this race was going to happen until about a week ago, and the 4800m track race was totally unexpected, but I rolled with it because I knew I was in good shape and also the 2 time reigning champ so still a favourite to win.

### Pre-race
I was a little bit more nervous than usual about this race, as I haven't run a track race since high school (and back then I was not competitive), and I am far less dominant at shorter distances, being more of a long distance specialist.

Then life threw a couple curve balls at me.  On Thursday by 3 year old daughter caught a stomach bug and spent most of the day throwing up.  I came home from work and consoled her by cuddling with her and napping with her for most of the day.  I thought it a bit odd that I spent about 5 hours in the middle of the day napping, and felt more tired than usual.  Then on Friday I woke up and realized I also had the stomach bug, and spent most of the day flat on my back between trips to the bathroom.  I didn't eat much more than half a bowl of oatmeal and a popsicle that day.  I had to let my 119 day run streak die, that gives you a bit of an idea of how rotten I felt.  By Friday night I was starting to feel a bit better, although pretty weak and my back was pretty sore from laying down all day.  I wasn't sure if I would even make it to the race, let alone race to anywhere near the best of my ability.

I woke up Saturday not feeling sick, but my back was in a real state.  Looking in the mirror, my pelvis was lopsided and I couldn't bend to my left.  When I tried to put shorts on, I almost fell down when I tried to lift my right leg.  I was pretty certain my right SI joint was seized up, but the race wasn't until 2 in the afternoon and it didn't feel inflamed, just really tight so I spent most of the morning stretching it out.  Did a 2 mile easy shakeout run and it didn't feel great and I felt like I was running lopsided, but I felt like things were starting to slowly loosen up.  Luckily, by the time the race rolled around, I was mostly loosened up, and all I had to worry about was whether I had it in me to put out a 5k effort after being sick the day before.

The track we were racing on was not in great shape.  It was mostly gravel but overgrown with weeds in several sections, and there were a few exposed rocks that they were kind enough to spraypaint for visibility.  I had meant to run the track on Thursday or Friday to get a feel for it as I had never run on it before, but obviously that wasn't in the cards.

I sized up my competition before the race started - it ended up being a pretty small field, only 6 racers in total.  Of those, only 2 other guys looked like they would pose a challenge - one young guy with a rainbow coloured afro, and a blonde guy my age who looked to be in decent shape.  My strategy as discussed with a few running buddies would be to stay near the front of the pack for the first mile or two and then pull away for the last mile.

### Race
The start of the race consisted of all of us lining up at the red spraypainted line on the track while one of the race marshalls said ""okay, on your marks..."" and the other race marshall abruptly yelling ""go"" without warning.  Rainbow Fro and Blonde Guy took off at blazing speed and my initial reaction was ""uh oh, they're going to make me work for this"".  I let them take the lead and followed them within striking distance at a somewhat unsustainable pace, but I had a feeling that this might be inexperienced pacing on their part.  After about 500m my suspicions were confirmed, Blonde Guy fell back somewhat abruptly and by 600m I was in the lead and creating separation.

I maintained a workmanlike pace for the next lap or two.  I wanted to set the tone for the race and make anybody who wanted to hang with me uncomfortable.  I resolved to not look over my shoulder, but to continue at the pace I was at until I could see Rainbow Fro on the other side of the track from me, which would indicate a comfortable 200+m lead.  I lapped my first competitor before the 800m mark, and by roughly the fourth lap I could see that I had the cushion I wanted and I could see Rainbow Fro's form was already starting to break down a little.  At that point I was pretty certain I had the race in the bag barring some misfortune, and I eased off the effort just a little and cruised for the rest of the race.

I think by lap 7 or 8 I had lapped the entire field at least once, and I was happy to note that I was feeling pretty decent.  Running more closely to my 10k pace but I was happy with that considering how messed up I was the day before.  I sped up for the bell lap just because I could and finished the race with about a 600m lead for a comfortable win and a relatively easy $800 in my pocket.

### Post-race
I hung out at the finish line to cheer in the rest of the field, we exchanged some back pats and I chatted up a few spectators who were pretty impressed with my performance.  Did a photo op with the Chief and he presented me with a cool little trophy and an envelope full of cash.  Then I hopped in my truck and changed into my baseball gear and went and played in a baseball tournament.

There you have it.  Hopefully I'm feeling good enough tomorrow to get back into my regular routine again because I've got an 18 mile long run planned.

346,AdvancedRunning,bluearrowil,Are you in the middle of 18-week Pfitz and you're missing runs? You are not alone.,"**TLDR: Missing a couple runs (including longs and workouts) isn't going to destroy your marathon. Listen to your body, if you need a day or two off, take it. Adapting your schedule is part of creating a successful performance.**

Been seeing some posts from some of the community training for Chicago and Boston that's been worried about missing runs, feeling dejected, and not feeling 100%. You are not alone.

When anyone sets out their training calendar, we never prepare for missed runs, unforseen calf tightness, the cranky IT band, sudden loss of motivation. But it happens to everyone. 

Pfitz isn't designed to be easy, the book is literally called ""Advanced Marathoning."" The second block is notorious for being the hardest block. A month ago you might have held marathon pace for 10 miles and now you can barely hold it for a couple minutes. What happened?? What the fuck is going on??

You're searching the subreddit for answers. You're binging papers on dry-needling. Maybe those normatec boots might actually do the trick.

What's happening is you're at your limit and you need to start setting boundaries for yourself. Are easy runs getting harder and harder? Are you barely walking? Now is the time to take a day off. Maybe two. There's a fine line between general training fatigue and being on the brink of injury / overtraining. And trust me, if your gut and your legs are telling you that you need to skip that 20 mile long, listen.

**Personal Anecdote Section**

Last race I trained on Pfitz 18/85, I created at table of what I put down below. In block 2 I missed 20% of the miles including an 18 mile marathon pace long and 6 mile LT workout. I thought I was fucked. Total mileage missed was 73 miles in the block. I had soleus issues that I babysat for weeks.

The goal for that training block was to take my marathon PR down from 3:03 to 2:55. I ended up running a 2:54. It's ok to miss runs.

**Simple Advice: Keep a training journal**  
Write down somewhere at the end of your runs how you feel, good or bad. You missed it? Why? You feel better today? Great write it down. That way next time you train for a race and you start feeling like shit, you can go back and read in your own words and thoughts what worked and didn't, and how you overcome.

Also you don't need those normatec boots.",1629481910

Am 33 year old male runner - plan averages 65km a week and peaks at 75km. Have run a 3.15 marathon but that was 3 years ago and due to kids have dropped a fair bit of fitness and carrying an extra 10-15kg. Aim for this HM is to run 1.45 but if in shape would like to do quicker… 
Am probably in about 21 minute 5km pace currently.
12 week plan that is basically broken down as 
M - Long Run - builds up to 32km
T - Recovery - 4-5km
W - Aerobic 7-10km
T - Session day (what I want ideas for)
F - Recovery 5km
S - 6-7km with a couple of tempo km’s
S - Rest day

So for the session day generally want a workout that is about 10-12km - I do a 2km warm up and a 2km cool down.
So what I currently have in there:
- Yasso 800s
- Fartlek
- 4’/1’
- Hill repeats (the hill I use climbs about 50m over 600m)
- Tempo (5-10km at goal HMP or faster)

In the past have utilised the following too:
- Mile/KM repeats
- Mile breakdowns

So yeah - would love any fresh ideas for a session",1629466112

Second interval was 7:20.  Not horrible.

I was curious to hear how others who have done this like to prepare or any general advice they might have. **I have NO expectations for timing with either race. They are simply for my enjoyment.** 

For some background: I’m a 26F and have been running since I was 14 years old. I’ve run 10+ half marathons, 1 “ultra half” aka a 15-mile road race, 4 full marathons and 1 trail 50k. During training I usually run 5x/week and do strength/mobility work 3x/week with two full rest days. My weekly mileage varies depending on the distance I am training for. Let me know if there would be any other information you might find useful! Thanks",1629302083

I usually have a towel and sometimes even bring clothes to throw on over my running clothes but it doesn't seem to be enough.

I'm in Austin, TX and obviously have to run in hot and humid conditions throughout a large chunk of the year and frequently drive to different locations to do training sessions or long runs, but afterwards, it's so hard to keep the sweat off my seats and I don't want the smell to linger.",1629300680
360,AdvancedRunning,nabuss11,Hanson Strength workout confusion,"32M, 60-80 MPW. First half of this year I followed the Hanson's Half Marathon Method plan en route to running a 1:08 HM. Once I got to the ""strength"" workout weeks, I was caught off guard by how hard they were. First week is 6x mile @ 10 seconds faster than target HM pace, so I was doing them around 5:05/mi. The longer workouts (3x 2 mi, 2x 3 mi) were killer. 

Fast forward to now, I'm following the Hanson (full) Marathon Method and plan to run Boston, target 2:25. First strength workout is the same 6x mile, at 10 seconds faster than target *marathon* pace, so for me about 5:25/mi. This workout was an absolute cakewalk, afterwards I wondered whether I read something wrong. 

So why the big difference? The ""speed"" workouts from Hanson are very similar between the half and full plans, and the tempos are adjusted for the full plan by being slower but also longer. The strength workouts just seem... easier? Recovery between intervals is similar. Wondering whether I should adjust or just focus on getting a quality long run/workout in on a regular basis; I did find during the HM plan I was pretty wiped from the week and the long run was the thing I'd cut back on to recover.",1629299236

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is 10k Overdistance Intervals**.

https://www.podiumrunner.com/training/workout-week-10k-overdistance-intervals/

*History:*

Ryan Carrara, coach of New Balance Boston, has his athletes do this workout late in the season (4-5 weeks out from goal race).

*Why:*

10k's suck. They consist of the pain of a 5k for double the distance. This will help train you to reign in that sucky-ness. 

*How:*

Warmup + 4x1:00 @ 3k pace w/1:00 recovery + 4x1.5 miles @ 10k pace w/3:00 rest + 4x1:00 @ 3k pace w/1:00 recovery + cooldown. It's like a reverse ice cream sandwich! A sushi roll if you will.

*What:*

The idea is that you will get the feeling of the last bit of a 10k but not the recovery time needed post-race due to the generous rest portions. Try and complete the workout on the surface that your goal race is on (road on roads, cross country on trails, etc).

*When:*

About 4-5 weeks out from a goal 10K and should be done in an environment that is specific to the event you’re targeting",1629294035
363,AdvancedRunning,ruinawish,"Strength training for runners: a primer, based on contemporary research","While working on the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/wiki/faq), I came across this 2019 infographic called ['Running myth: strength training should be high repetition low load to improve running performance'](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/54/13/813.full.pdf) from the British Journal of Sports Medicine (funnily enough, I've previously been treated by one of the authors involved). It isn't a systematic review/meta-analysis in itself, but presents a few findings from studies in the last few years (in particular, this [systematic review by Blagrove et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889786/pdf/40279_2017_Article_835.pdf)).

While the infographic, and the studies it cites, are well worth a read to understand why strength training can benefit runners, it addressed a few talking points that are often raised on the sub, of which I'll list a few here:

* **Completing endurance type exercises (e.g. 3 sets of 20 reps or more with light resistance) has been reported to be less effective than heavy resistance and explosive resistance training in achieving benefits to running performance. Examples  of heavy resistance exercises commonly utilised include barbell squats, deadlifts, steps- ups, lunges  and calf raise variations.**
 
* **Completing exercises with moderate resistance, for example, 60%–80% of 1 repetition maximum for 3–6 sets of 5–15 repetitions has been reported to benefit performance. For distance runners, training to repetition failure is not recommended.**

'Lift heavy, low reps' is a recommendation that has frequently been mentioned in previous discussions on strength training on the subreddit. However, Blagrove et al., (2018) found that the studies that utilised low reps (3-5) at loads &gt;80% of 1RM ""did not observe superior benefits compared to investigations that prescribed resistance training at moderate loads (60-80% 1RM) and higher repetition ranges (5-15 repetitions)"". 

Similarly, squats and deadlifts are frequently mentioned on the sub, but step ups and calf raises are rarely brought up (the latter usually only mentioned when preventing/managing injuries... the infographic's author mention that the the role of strength training in injury prevention is not well understood).

* **While the addition of two to three supervised  strength sessions per week [will benefit?] (*incomplete text in the PDF*), initially focussing on a periodised heavy resistance training programme is recommended.**

This recommendation once again comes from Blagrove et al., 2018. The emphasis on heavy resistance training is based on studies that suggest ""an advantage long-term in... reducing injury risk and eliciting a more more pronounced training effect"". In addition to heavy resistance training, the authors also discuss other modalities such as explosive resistance training, and plyometric training, acknowledging for the non-strength trained runner, ""any novel strength training stimulus is likely to... induce an adaptation in the short term."" However, no actual practical recommendation is made on what the periodisation should look like.

* **There is no one size fits all approach when it comes to strength training for   endurance runners. Exercise  selection, weight, sets, reps and recovery all depend on the individuals’ needs, injury history, goals, ability and training experience.**

I think this is one of the more important points when it comes to strength training, and a reason why specific strength training questions will usually see a range of answers. The sub seems to see a lot of crossover with users from power lifting/weight lifting backgrounds, and their recommendations/suggestions will very much be based on their experiences with strength training.

* **It is recommended that runners seek the assistance of an experienced health   professional or strength and conditioning coach to ensure they start out safely and   get the most out of their strength training program.**

As with above, you can collect a range of ideas from strangers on the internet, but you won't have anyone tell you whether you're doing an exercise correctly, or how an ideal strength training program can look for you. For example, one of the first questions a physio/sports clinician will ask you when prescribing interventions is: ""Do you have access to a gym? What equipment do you have at home?"". Accordingly, a strength training program can be developed with the resources available to you.

* **Careful programming should allow at least 3 hours recovery after high- intensity running before completing strength training, and at least 24 hours recovery  after strength training before a high-intensity running session is scheduled.**

This covers another frequently asked question on the sub: 'When should I do my strength training'?.

---

In my scanning of contemporary academic literature on the topic, I have not been able to find anything suggesting that one perfect strength training protocol. I imagine it doesn't exist, because there's so many variables when it comes to the exercises, or the characteristics of the runners themselves.

The goal of research studies is usually to find a cause and effect relationship. While systematic reviews then provide a higher level of evidence, being based on multiple studies, it still leaves us with broad findings such as ""completing  exercises with moderate resistance, for example, 60%–80% of 1 repetition maximum for  3–6  sets of 5–15 repetitions has been reported to benefit performance"". Thus, I think this is where having advice from a professional sports clinician/coach is valuable, to interpret the evidence, and provide an intervention best suited to you.

Keen to hear your thoughts on the topic, and if you've come across any resources that support or contradict the ideas presented in this infographic.

Personally, I'm interested to find more information about how exercises involving bodyweight (e.g. [Myrtl routine](https://runnyday.in/myrtl-routine/)) and core strength (here's a [2009 study for example](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2009/01000/does_core_strength_training_influence_running.22.aspx?casa_token=V81OYydxZxsAAAAA:Y1Ye5WDeAv3ztNO8B27hkSgoa4DDnerrElsl2lc8ysU_AGnyjZa2EDEMif4_3xDpqGG5hcukyRF5qfsYBYji6IbMNw)) can fit into a strength training program, beside resistance training and plyometrics.",1629293490

366,AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,Are my Hoka's &amp; orthotics causing my injury? Random foot problems flairing up....,"In February 2021 during the end of the run, I had shooting left heel pain out of nowhere. I tried running the next day and was in absolute agony. I couldn't even walk back because it hurt to push off my foot. However, it almost didn't hurt at all when I wore flip-flops, only closed backed shoes. I never got an official diagnosis, but I suspected insertional achilles tendonitis or bursitis. I also nordic skied and was running 10ks and halfs before all this, so my coach suspected switching from the rigid ski boot to my running shoe caused the injury.   


I took 3-4 weeks off (still biked) and the pain was sort of gone. It still hurt a bit to wear a running shoe backing. I tried on a pair of Hoka One One's with orthotics and I was shocked. I ran pain free! Sometimes I could still ""feel"" it but there was no pain. I had one of my best track seasons and ended up PRing in meets. I'll say that my Hoka's saved my track season lol.  


Around June I started noticing my left heel/achilles becoming stiff (this time higher up) and I chalked that up to not stretching as much. I switched to a new pair of Hoka's and kept the orthotics and then started noticing my RIGHT heel felt a little stiff (crap). It even began to pop during runs and when I pressed down on the tendon, I felt a bit of pain. Seemed like classic achilles tendonitis, just my luck. This time in my ""good heel."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Every run since July something hurts in my feet (though nowhere's near the pain I experienced in February). The bottom of my right foot, my left calf, the top of my right foot, my left heel, my right inner ankle (I hope to God it's not posterior tibial tendonitis - it started a couple days ago). It's not in my head, but I know in the past I ran through little twinges here and there, but these feel a bit more significant, though I could be wrong. When one foot hurts somewhere the other doesn't and vice versa. There is no ""good foot"" anymore lol.  


Luckily these ""injuries"" haven't caused me to stop running though I've debating taking time off and had to ice frequently. It doesn't help that I worked a lot as a cashier on my feet standing in one spot all day. I've been an absolute pain to deal with according to my family, even though I've tried not to dwell on injuries and jump to worst case scenario. But it's frustrating. I'm not 100% pain free and I'm not sure if I ever will be. It sucks. I know I could just take time off but my season starts in 2 days and it's not like taking time off for a couple weeks will even resolve things. It's likely like I'll need more long term time off and then start all over again. Sigh.  


I've been lucky to be injury free so far. I did once run through a week of plantar fasciitis, and a month of weird foot stuff last summer. Both went away and never came back. Up until my injuries I was running in Brooks and loved them. I don't really think they contributed to my injury. Some people pointed me towards a more stabilizing shoe, but I usually had neutral. For three years I once noticed every time I bent down to tie my shoe, the bone (my tibia?) slightly above my inner left ankle hurt (but it NEVER hurt to run and nothing ever happened - it's gone now). Now my inner tendon bone above my ankle hurts on right side, too..  


But the other day I tried running in a Brooks pair (stabilizing) to transition out of Hoka's and the outside of my right ankle by the tendon hurt, so back to adding in orthotics and eventually just switching to Hoka's again it was. Any recommendations on how to proceed? I feel hopeless and luckily I will have a trainer to talk with. I don't want to do longterm damage, but since running doesn't seem to be worsening it (?) is there any way I can attempt to get rid of it? Sorry for long post.",1629240286

368,AdvancedRunning,Ethnadar,summer improvements + goal reevaluation,"At the beginning of summer I got tested at a sports clinic, and my stats were average at best. My VO2 Max was &lt;50 and my lactate threshold pace was 7:30. 

I’ve always been a “work as hard as I can at every moment” person, so I was reluctant to hear that in order to improve my 5k the most, I needed longer and slower runs. Most days I wouldn’t even be under 8 min/mile. Don’t get me wrong, some days I would do some faster work (2x2 mile at 6:30 pace with 90s break).

Anyway today was my 2nd test, and here are the results:

VO2 Max - ~62.3
Lactate threshold pace - 5:40

I know that my numbers aren’t INSANE, but I would still like to say that I’m proud of myself for coming this far, getting faster, and most importantly, being a LOT better at injury prevention. 

 Since the first test, I’m about halfway along the timeline until my state cross country meet, and my goal is to win. Currently in my district and state (Iowa 2a), anyone under 16:30 is a contender for winning, so low 16s is my goal. 

I’ve had the confidence all summer, but now I feel I also have genuine potential. 

This is my 2nd post in this sub, the first is me explaining my goals (albeit in a much more desperate manner) and every reply I got was extremely helpful, I’ve been injury free since that post and I would just like to thank everyone who suggested ideas, I now know the importance of stretching and recovery. 

I’m using these posts mostly as journal for myself to explain where I am and how others at the elite level react to how my training is going, so if there is anything for you to add that to think could benefit me, please, speak up!

369,AdvancedRunning,hayfeverrun,Chasing injuries around the same foot for almost a year,"Curious if anyone has had experience with and/or links to good resources to understand cause-and-effects behind different foot injuries I've been chasing over the last 9 months.

First, I thought I had plantar fasciitis (I probably did, as my foot cramped in the plantar fasciitis area in a run, and I had been exhibiting the classic signs of waking steps in pain, albeit more like 1-2/10 versus stabbing pain) 

So, I largely ignored it but switched to cross-training and lower volume. Eventually, I was told by a doc I probably have insertional Achilles (about 3 months ago)

More recently, after a silly day of spiking my volume, I developed a case of peroneal tendonitis. It was self-diagnosed, but the signs were clear and far more disruptive than the earlier 2. Unlike the earlier 2, where my foot was probably exhibiting warning signs but wasn't actually causing any problems, this one did not allow me to even walk for a few weeks (and I'm still rebuilding).

More importantly, these have all been on the same foot (right).

**Questions**

1. Do these seem related? If so, is there something I'm doing that's leading to these? Any targeted remedies? (have tried the ""basics"" like foam rolling, stretching, particularly around the calf muscles, but haven't really found any systematic tight spots)
2. Would love a sense check on my doc's usual advice (who is a runner as well) - which is usually to rest, ramp slowly, and don't worry too much about 1-2/10 pain unless its getting worse",1629231954

So I feel like it's worth the trade off but does anyone know how quickly bones can bounce back? I'm in my 20's by the way, supposedly the prime of your health.

379,AdvancedRunning,Dat__,How to adjust marathon expectations based on first HM time trial?,"Yesterday was the midpoint of my Marathon training which was my first half marathon time trial which I ran in yesterday in 1:44. I initially set a goal of sub-4 which looks like is already doable based on this result. I’m 26M 5’11” 160lbs training for my first marathon in October, following the Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 plan with a few more miles per week and 40miles cycling per week for cross-training. No injury/pain concerns at all yet. Before starting the plan I did 3 weeks of 20 miles per week to get a feel for the mileage, as I’ve only been doing casual ~5-10 weeks before that for about a year. Looking back I should have built more of a real base before starting, but that’s besides the point.

Now it’s looking like I may be able to strive for a bit better time than just sub-4. Considering that I did &gt;85% of my training in brutally hot/humid summer temps, and that I have 9 more weeks in the plan (which is backloaded with higher mileage) leading to a cool fall race in October, how should I *generally* update my pace expectations for the marathon accordingly, and/or how should I analyze my HM results to make the most impactful improvements in training going forward?

[Here are my splits for the run, along with HR data for the same splits](https://imgur.com/a/Atnx4oG). I felt it went better than expected and didn’t have any huge struggles during the race.

12 hour trail race coming up in southern Louisiana in two weeks which marks today as my first day of taper. It will be a very hot day (as they all are) on a technical trail. 

From my reading, adaptation to the heat happens “relatively” quickly over the course of a few weeks and since it’s the most difficult race specific hurdle that I will face, would it be wise to do the taper runs outside in the heat to keep/gain my heat tolerance or would it be better to use the taper to fully recover by staying indoors and avoiding the heat?",1629126514
381,AdvancedRunning,DickensofDetroit,Base Building post-HM,"29M, began running in late Nov. 2020.

Started with Active’s Couch to 5k program, the 5k to 10K program after that, then signed up and trained for a HM. Just ran my first half in 1:50:19. For the half training, I didn’t follow a super-specific plan. Peak mileage week was 28 mi, but overall average mpw throughout the plan was in the low 20s.

I’d like to build my base up to 50 mpw over the next several months and have identified the Pfitz 45 mpw base-building plan as a place to start. That plan starts at 27 miles - is that too high based on the average mpw in my half training? Should I do a few weeks of lower mileage before jumping into the base building plan?

Over the last year and a half or so, I've had numerous mileage ramp ups in an attempt to improve and get back to my HS level of fitness (See my flair for my HS times).  I always seem to get my mileage up to around 25-30 mpw, and then my shins start to break down.  Every time.

People always mention shoes when talking about shins, so I'll say I have a high arch and I alternate between 2 pairs of Hoka Clifton 8's.
 
About 6 months ago I decided I was sick of the injuries and felt I was always doing things a bit too aggressively, so I was going to ramp up so slowly that it was physically impossible to get hurt when I got to the dreaded 30 mpw.  I started with 3 runs of 3 miles per week and did that for a month straight, and then ramped up over 6 months from there.  I was adding, on average, 1 mile per week to my weekly volums.  Every other week, I do a long run, and on the ""off week"" I do a longer-but-not-super-long run.

Currently I'm at this point:

&gt;Long week:  6, 3, 4, rest, 10, 4, rest

&gt;Off week: 6, 3, 4, rest, 7, 4, rest

Again, this was built up to slowly over the course of 6 months, and I've held my mileage for a month at the above schedule.  Sure enough, after 1 month of training at this mileage, my shins started to break down and started hurting.  I'm simply baffled at this point.  Not only have I been well UNDER the 10% rule, I'm also taking a week completely off every 5-6 weeks to fully recover.  This isn't even high mileage, this was a recovery week for me in high school. 

I also walk a mile or two every day in minimalist shoes around my neighborhood, sometimes even walking in just my socks.

I'm looking for advice on how to proceed from here.  I honestly have no idea what else I can do.  I eat healthy, I get lots of sleep, I have a midfoot stripe and I maintain right around 180 steps per minute.  Am I just screwed to never be able to get in any sort of good shape because I can't up my mileage?",1629090847

So I've kind of been looking at this thread for a while and I'm so jealous of everyone here. I see so many people being able to run amazing distance with times and stuff and I desperately want to do that but I can't. I know that this is a thread for super advanced runners but your help would be greatly appreciated  So basically I started running March of last year. I was 140 lbs and I just wanted to incorporate healthier habits into my life like eating healthy and giving my body much needed activity. I wasn't doing C25k; I was just running at whatever speed outside. Fast forward to November/ December 2020, I became really insecure with my body and started calorie counting up until March 2021. I was eating 1600-1700 calories a day while running 4 miles three to four times a week and also doing like an hour of weight training and dropped down to 116-117 pounds. I was sick of counting calories so I stopped before my lacrosse season. Fast forward to now, I can only run 2-3 miles (even sometimes, my runs don't even feel good like my legs get sluggish and I feel tired). I run at a relatively okay pace. Right now my time for a 5k is 27:13, my 2 mile is 17:21, and my 1.5 mile is 11:42. But I cannot run more than that or else my legs start feel tight and I get side stitches or my body makes some other excuse to stop running. I am in good shape, on the skinny side with a two-pack, some arm and leg definition, but my athletic performance is struggling. I also haven't been seeing any progress in my arms when lifting weights like I'm getting slightly stronger but my arms still look the same. My legs usually feel super tight after a gym session and I'm slowly losing my passion for running when I really do love it. I just want to be able run more and I feel like something in my body is just not agreeing with it. Now I only run 2-3 times a week which I don't know how to feel about (my dad was a competitive runner and says that running a lot at a young age will have an effect on your knees so that's one thing).I feel as if I eat enough a day, but sometimes I find myself limiting myself or choosing the lower calorie option, but I don't track but know I'm eating around 90-100g of protein a day.

a) Keep going with the 18/55 plan I'm on right now, and just ride the fitness gains I'm inevitably going to get from that;

391,AdvancedRunning,TheAnonymousUsername,"Is the often debated “anabolic window” relevant to runners? And if so, does cooling down chew into it?","For anyone unaware, my (relatively simple/uninformed) knowledge is that the anabolic window refers to the 30-60 minutes post exercise when the body is most primed to build muscle, making it an ideal time to consume protein and carbs. And after that timeframe/window, the body is much less primed to build muscle (basically you get less bang for your buck as far as muscle growth if you have protein 2 hours post workout instead of 30 minutes after).

I know cardio is a catabolic activity, but my (again, somewhat uninformed) understanding is that post exercise the body is in an anabolic state.

My question, in regards to running, is what if you’re doing some type of marathon session that has a super long cool down (like 6-10 miles) where you’re running a hard session in the first quarter or half of the run, and then running the second half of your run easy on worn out legs.

Does the anabolic window start once you finish your hard effort/session or does it start once you finish your run, even if the last 40 minutes was easy jogging?

393,AdvancedRunning,MrDrProfBrad,"Long-term, probably self-induced changes to appetite during long runs","General background: I (26/m) have one marathon under my belt that I did in April and am planning to run another one late this fall. Before training for my first marathon I had a solid 20 mpw base and peaked mid 30s. Now, I have a solid mid 30s mpw base before starting training for my 2nd marathon. 

Long run nutrition background: While training for my first marathon I only ate protein bars during long runs (12-20 miles) until the last couple weeks when I started trying beef jerky too. Once I started doing long runs again after the marathon I mostly ate beef jerky and dropped the protein bars, not because I couldn't tolerate them but just because I liked the beef jerky. A couple weeks after I started adding dried fruit to my long run diet, again just because it tasted good. Fast forward 2-3 months and now after not eating protein bars during long runs for all this time it feels like they are the last thing I'd want to put in my stomach during a long run. I carried one with me during my 12 mile run today but I wanted nothing to do with it even as I became hungry in the last few miles. 

ALSO - my general diet has stayed the same throughout all of this. Although now I only eat 3-4 large meals per day where before I snacked throughout the day.

Question: have I unintentionally manipulated my long run appetite? Could I go back to protein bars (not that I really need to) if I forced myself? Could I get myself used to eating absolutely anything during long runs so long as it gives me good nutrients/fuel? Has anyone else experienced something like this?",1628974606

## Training

I haven't had a ""training plan"" per se since getting back into running literally the day that COVID shut down in-person classrooms at the preschool I was teaching at in March of 2020. Prior to that I'd done a few 10K, 15K type ""fun run"" events every few years, but no serious running with regular 40+ mpw months since two years as a college track team walk-on in 2007 and 2008.

I got up to a regular \~70 mpw for most of the spring of 2021 with two pretty successful trail ultramarathons -- a 3:59 finish marred by a course navigation DQ, and a slower but first overall finish on one out in Long Island. I nabbed a HM PR in a solo effort at 1:27 in there, too, and threw in a couple solo marathon-length FKTs for good effort.

I picked up a little IT band niggle in early June, though, ending a \~120 day running streak and putting me onto the Peloton to spin for a bit. That, strength work and some easy reintroduction of jogging got me back into running \~20mpw in about a week... just in time for my wife and I to pack up everything we owned and move from New York to Oregon via a U-Haul truck.

July was pretty sloppy, some base miles at a slower pace than prior to my IT niggle, a tiny bit of speed work, gradually working up from June's 20mpw back to 50. I finally felt ""back"" with a solid 14 mile long run at a respectable 7:30 pace two weeks ago, leaving me reasonably confident for the local running club's 30K.

## Pre-race

Nothing too special. I did find a hell of a price on Vaporfly 4% Flyknits at a Nike Outlet, and took them for a one-mile shakeout on Friday. Based mostly on that 14'er from late July, I figured I could reasonably hit \~7:10 pace for the race and a \~2:10 finishing time, maybe closer to 7-flat with good company and conditions. I passed on my evening bourbon for a couple days prior to race day, got a reasonable amount of sleep, picked out my favorite 2"" purple shorts, and was good to go on Saturday morning.

The race has both solo runners and teams for a 3x10K relay. At the start I recognized one sponsored-by-Brooks local hero who I figured would crush the solo (which he did), then was left to roughly guess who else I might see in the \~2:10 range based on... IDK, body composition and running gear. It's even trickier than usual because I see one kid who looks like a solid local XC/TF high schooler... on the same relay team as his 50 year old dad-bod dad. Whatever, time to run.

## Race

Sure enough, Brooks guy takes off at the gun, followed by a different teenager relay kid who I assume is badly overdoing it (based mostly on his cotton tee). I'm third behind them, with one or two dudes not too far behind when I glance over my shoulder. Our area of the Oregon Coast has an omnipresent wind out of the north for most of the year -- it's milder today, but still at our backs for the first two or three miles that roll downhill. Mile one... 6:40? Hmm. Effort feels reasonable and maintainable, I'm sure it'll even out. Followed by 6:37... good still...

Middle of the third mile, the Brooks guy is already out of sight off the front. The cotton tee relay high schooler is within 50 feet and looking miserable. There's Jason right behind me, then apparently nothing within sight behind him. OK, so it's time to hold with Jason or face what'll probably be 16 solo miles if I let him get ahead.

Sure enough, cotton tee fades out behind us. Mile three with Jason comes by at 6:21 -- uh oh -- but he doesn't hold that for too long after the split and we settle back into 6:40's as the 10K mark comes up.

The course turns up into the (still mild) wind and onto some rolling hills around this point. Three or four times I find myself putting 30 or 60 meters on Jason on a shortish climb, only for him to make it back up on the descent and flats. I've got no particular interest in trying to drop him; we're still in the 6:50's on the rolling sections, way ahead of my goals, and still feeling sustainable. 20K in \~1:23. Around here I ask him what he was trying to finish in; he's definitely looking fresher than me, but I don't know if he misheard me or what because we go into a short chat about hometowns. Whatever.

The race was advertised for relay teams as saving the third 10K for the ""hills lover"", but it's really pretty mild. On one of Jason's turns to lead the way for a still-flattish section near mile 14 he kicks into 6:15 pace and I get worried but decide to stick on his shoulder --  whatever the reason was, it doesn't last for more than a half mile or so, and we're back to comfy in the 6:40's range.

Mile 16 has a net gain of \~150 feet with a little rolling; I split a 7:30 and build my biggest lead of the day over Jason for second overall, but don't really have it in me to start a kick for the last 2.5 and sure enough he's right on my shoulder.

There's one last notable bump as we take a bridge back into town -- and for this climb, he's right on my shoulder. The bridge and its narrow sidewalk ends, and Jason takes off right before the turn into the finish area. I split 6:15 pace for my last 1K but Jason gets me for second place by probably 20 seconds as I finish in 2:05:41. Brooks guy first overall by a solid 20 minutes, of course.

## Post-race

The usual postrace BBQ, water, beer and such. I meet a local Olympic Qualifiers-level race-walker who was first overall in the women's 30K with a comfortable-for-her jogging cruise, pet some dogs, and head home to write up this pile of words.

I'd be lying if I didn't think about stretching my 6:45 pace over a full marathon and BQ'ing. No real idea if I want to fly cross-country for a race in 2022 -- leaning ""no"", but it's bouncing around my brain at least. I've actually never run a sanctioned marathon, so at least training to get a sub-3 somewhere local would be a nice goal. And maybe following a more structured training plan to get there...

* 1 long, 13-22 miles (same pace)
* 2 hard, 3mi WU/CD + 3-4 mi tempo (9-ish) or interval, like 3x4 min with 5min recovery (9-ish)

My thing is I often become food obsessed and can feel lightheaded throughout the day due to my deficit. I average about 2000-2200 calories a day. 

I lift 6-7 days a week, PPL. Minimum miles running is 4, and I’m going to be slowly increasing that overtime. I’ll be cycling and swimming on my days I don’t work. I’ll be really active, and would much prefer to feel good rather than so “off” while running a deep deficit. 

I don’t want to do this wrong, and it seems like I should be eating more, but I don’t know if I should just deal with it and push through. This is part of a verbal process, but I’m also looking for help and insight since like I said I am new to racing and training more like an athlete. I only lifted before. 

Hope this all makes sense and I look forward to any help!",1628915382

405,AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Running and Weight,"Hey all, some of you might remember my post [earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/kuvtnb/does_anyone_else_just_hate_dealing_with_weight/) lamenting the interplay between running and weightloss. Its been a while, and I wanted to share an update on my situation and some thoughts on the process. 

Since that post I've lost about 12 pounds, and I'm currently hanging out around 150. For a 5'8/5'9 guy I could probably cut a bit more, but I'm pretty well built and I think this is as far as I want to go from a health perspective. My big breakthrough was just learning to fall asleep without worrying about how much I had eaten that day. I don't have any big tips or tricks here, for a long time sleeping with a deficit was a problem and then it wasn't. I was able to get more stringent about IF and the deficits followed naturally. 

The cut generally was not linear, I'd drop a few pounds, plateau, then drop several more. I did not count calories and continued to run around 50 mpw. I'm not sure if my workouts were impacted, but as I got below 155 I did notice a bit more lethargy and maybe reduced recovery. Its hard to know, because this corresponded with some pretty solid training and the Summer heat. I absolutely had some shitty workouts in there but also some super solid ones. 

If you're looking for motivation, I've absolutely set PRs and I can see my easier paces dropping pretty precipitously, about 30 sec min/mile faster even with the heat. Some of this is going to be down to an explosion of aerobic fitness that I think has come from a year of solid base building, but def some of it is the cut weight too. 

I would say though this is not a process that's intrinsically safe or healthy. I definitely think more about how/when I eat and have developed a propensity to undereat a bit. Weight loss trains you to habitually eat at a deficit, and its a pattern you need to be prepared to arrest when you start to get close to your goal weight. I can absolutely see how someone would blow past their initial goal target and get into dangerous territory. Looking better and running faster are great but its super easy to conflate both of those with weight loss, which is not sustainable at all. 

All and all I have mixed feelings on this. Running faster is great, but I do think losing weight as an athlete is a bit more dangerous than folks give credence too. Most people at least know about the physical risk, but I think there are very real mental health issues that can develop as a result of an extended cut like this and if you're considering it I'd advise you to be very honest with yourself about motivations, goals, and habits. I've seen multiple athletes succumb to REDs over time and its not pretty, most of them haven't really recovered

For those of you who've cut a bunch of weight, how has keeping it off gone? I'm down about 20 pounds in the last two years, and going from 170-&gt;160 seemed super sustainable. Should I expect the same here? Do you still watch your diet? I think one of the hardest parts so far has been arresting the cut back to a sustainable level of eating, hard to change ingrained habits like that. Any tips?",1628880177

409,AdvancedRunning,koteko_,Did a LT test in the lab,"I've long been interested in the physiology of running and how it applies to training, and the road to understanding is still long. But the relationship between lactate and HR has always been a curiosity of mine, and I finally got a proper test done instead of endless approximations.

# Premise

\- I have Forerunner 945 that I've set to use with Heart Rate Reserve zones, having an actual maxHR and everyday recalculating the zones based on resting HR (depending on fitness and circumstances, it can be 55 to 70; but it's usually just around 60).

\- From 5K, 8K and 10K races/TTs, I had already guesstimated my LTHR at 179-180bpm but didn't have the confidence to build my zones over this before testing it in the lab

\- I don't have an HR strap so I've never tried Garmin's LT test. I've done time trials but I can't, say, run 30 minutes at a consistent pace. Any race or time trial I attempt, will be a bit chaotic in pace - I start fast, then succumb a bit, then surge back in the last Ks/laps. So Joe Friel's tests were also out. However, see above.. 8K and 10K races for slower runners, can help pinpoint the LT. For faster runners, 15K and HMs will be overall better indicators.

# How it's done

The test, for those that don't know, is performed like this (there are probably variations):

\- you get on a treadmill (with an HR strap) and run at a baseline for 5 minutes (7 km/h)

\- you stop and a doctor takes some blood from your earlobe (totally painless)

\- you start again, at 9 km/h for about 3 minutes, and get another sample

\- same process for 11, 13 and 15 km/h

At this point they have 5 HR values, and 5 lactate concentration values. They fit a line over the HR points, and an exponential curve over the lactate points, and then interpolate the corresponding HR values at 2 mmol/L (aerobic threshold or AeT or lactate inflection point, when lactate is about double than the basal concentration but it still doesn't accumulate if you keep intensity fixed) and 4 mmol/L (anaerobic threshold or AnT or lactate turnover point, above which lactate will keep increasing even if you stop increasing speed).

# Results

In this way they get **HR @ AeT** as well as **HR @ AnT.** I got **159** and **179** respectively. Now, these are the zones I currently have configured on my Garmin, they are classic Karvonen zones applied to HRR:

&amp;#x200B;

|Max HR: 196|Resting HR: 60||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Z1|128|140.6|
|Z2|141.6|154.2|
|Z3|155.2|167.8|
|Z4|168.8|181.4|
|Z5|182.4|196|

The end of Z4 is pretty close to AnT, and the end of Z2 is pretty close to the AeT. So I've been training ""correctly"".

Other interesting tidbits:

\- my optical wrist HR was more stable in the last, 15 km/h step of the test, than the provided HR strap. For the lower zones, they were in sync. This means I can trust my 945 a lot (which I already suspected).

\- Garmin's LTHR Zones, if I plug 179, show 159 as the upper end of Zone 2 (which is usually where one expects the AeT). I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or if they actually chose some very good zone bounds. Comparatively, 80/20 calculator gives me 161 as Z2's upperbound.

\- the test costed like a new pair of running shoes, but the ""retest"" after 1 or 1.5 months is free. I'm **very** curious to know if after intense training, the HR at AeT and AnT will change, or only the pace. And how will this related to resting HR and the corresponding zones? We'll see :)

\- I don't think I'll set my zones to LTHR for now, until I'm sure about how it changes over time. With HRR, I **see** resting HR going down over time, as training intensifies, and I change my zones accordingly. With LTHR, I still have no clue about the dynamics over weeks and months and training.",1628869418
410,AdvancedRunning,yerbertMYfeartsRt8sy,"Question about HR, perceived effort, and hill training","Background: 31F.  I've been running since high school, but have had to take time off here and there due to endometriosis, surgeries, really bad IBS, and other random life things.  I used to be moderately fast (1600m|5:45, 3200m|12:08, 5k|20:20, HM|1:45:00ish), but those times have gone up significantly since my glory days.  My goal now is 1:40:00 HM before I hit 40-- I call it ""40 by 40""-- and it's very long-term because I expect chronic illness / life to get in the way periodically.  Some recent times were roughly 4k|20:00, 10k|55:00, HM|1:52:00.

I've been running consistently for over a year now and I'm currently at 40k a week over 4 days, plus 2 strength/easy cardio days, and 1 day walking/hiking.  I increase mileage by 25-30% each month, hold it for a month, drop 10-15% for a week, and then bump up again.  (I'm loosely following Jack Daniels, and everything is religiously mapped out in spreadsheets, down to what percentage of weekly mileage is spent on tempos, intervals, long runs, etc.)

I live in a ""hilly"" place near the Alps, so most races on my radar the next few months have some up and down.  This past week I ran a hill work-out on a 9%-grade, 300m-long hill.  I warmed up 2k, ran 10 reps with zigzaging jogs back downhill, and cooled down 2k.  It was warmer than usual and muggy in the woods, and it felt absolutely brutal.  Miraculously, I wasn't sore the next day (thanks, I think, to lots of strength-training and hiking), but my body felt heavy.  I had trouble sleeping the night after the workout and the following day, but it may also have been heat-related.  (Top floor with no AC, yayyyy.)

My Fitbit isn't 100% accurate at higher heart rates, but my perceived effort was 9/10.  My resting HR is 57, and I think my max HR is about 190, so 90-95% effort puts me at 177-183.  My Fitbit recorded consistent peaks of 179 during each effort and valleys at 130 in between.

Should I have allowed my HR to drop so much between efforts?  Was I potentially pushing my heart too hard during efforts?  I have some innate anxiety about tough work-outs-- like a fear that I won't be able to catch my breath-- and sometimes it's hard to tell if the heart-pounding breathlessness is panic, or what I should be feeling.  I think my HR dropped so much between efforts because I would need a few seconds to psych myself up before the next round.

I'm planning to repeat the workout once a month before my main race in November.  I also alternate intensities each week, e.g., next week my interval work-out will aim for 85-90%.",1628848555

414,AdvancedRunning,IR995,My view on Aerobic development,"I'm halfway in a 16 week training block leading to my first 100k mountain race.
It's going to be my first 100k, and because of how hard the course is, focusing 99% on easy/steady longer workouts seemed like the way to go as I sat down tailoring my plan.
I don't like to follow generalized training plas, because I have found success with how I write down my own plan, based on the pros taken from authors and coaches like Daniel, Lydiard, Magnes, Roche and the list goes on.
I mostly race in the mountains and on pretty hilly terrain, but what I found interesting is that I do NOT see the progress I was expecting to see when I started the plan.
Why do I think so? Well mostly because of the plan and outcome of a previous mountain marathon with a lot of D+. 
Back then, due to the winter snow in the mountains, training on specific terrain was limited, so I was kind of forced to train on flat roads despite racing in the mountains. Of course, it's not like I didn't go out on the trails, but I'd say 6 of my 10 weekly runs were on flat roads, sometimes even more, and the obes I did on trails were with much less elevation gain than my race.
For this race I decided to try and train Every. Single. Time. on terrain simmilar to my upcoming race.
BUT! Keeping the effort/Heart rate (measured with a chest strap) on trails is far more difficult than on a flat terrain. For example: I could go out for a 1hr tempo effort run, right? On an out-and-back course I could do an uphill-only run at tempo effort, but then when I needed to come down from the hills I simply could not keep the same effort because if I could do that, I think there's a fair chance I'd end up with injuries. 
My point is that I think it's more important to log in more TIME at a specific effort od HR, rather than just distance.
Now why is that? Uphill running is more demanding than running on flat terrain. Why don't I see the same and Better progress then?
Well in my opinion it's because of how much time one is actually able to stay at an effort, when training something specific, rather to just add miles of which half (for me at least) would be at HR/effort so low that I would never EVER have when running on flat roads.
What's your take on this? I'd like this to become a more in depth conversation in the comments, and not just a long post like this.",1628801479

426,AdvancedRunning,flipswhitfudge,Need help designing the endurance discipline for my team track and field project.,"I'm designing a more team-oriented format for track and field, with the goal of increasing participation in the sport and making things more interesting for the casual viewer. There are 6 disciplines, one for each major event group; sprint, vertical jump, horizontal jump, throw, hurdle, and endurance. 

I'm making a ""sportshall"" and an outdoor version of this team format. The sportshall version is to increase accessibility (not every school has a track), but the outside version is supposed to be the standard.

For the sportshall endurance discipline, I based it on the Yoyo pacer test [Yo-yo IR1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo_intermittent_test)
because it combines elements of endurance and popular team sports like basketball and soccer, improving the likelihood of recruiting athletes from multiple backgrounds. In this discipline, each team fields 6 runners who all undergo the yoyo test at the same time. When a runner reaches their limit, their distance is recorded and converted to points (every discipline is calibrated so 150 points is a good high school level performance in each discipline). Each 100m is worth 1 point. I'm satisfied with this design for the limited space of a sportshall, but I want to do something more track-based for outdoors.

So far the idea is to basically do competitive interval training. So there would be a target time and all athletes in the field would try to complete a lap inside the target time. After a short rest they would go again, and this repeats until none of the athletes are able to complete the run inside the target time anymore. Every lap completed by a runner contributes points to their team total. There would be pack tactics as runners try to take the inside lane and waste the other team's energy. 

The problem is I'm not from a distance running background so I'm not sure what the target time should be, how long the rest should be, or if any distance runners would actually enjoy this. There are also time constraints, as the plan is to have each event go one by one and have the whole thing last 2-3 hours. It's important not to have events running concurrent because I want each discipline to have its time to shine, and everyone's focus on those athletes. Because of this, it's ideal that the endurance event doesn't last much longer than around 30 mins. The target population is high school level athletes/ club athletes.

I just got back from my first trip (up in Colorado) and I wasn't able to do much running due to the really high altitude (9000+ feet) and I got pretty bad headaches whenever I tried to run. I usually only made it 1-3 miles at about 30-70 seconds slower than usual easy pace.

So I am basically one week untrained and in three days I will be leaving for another week and I will not have the ability to train. When I get back I have one day until XC starts. What I am asking is: how much fitness will I lose? and how quickly can I gain it back if I lose it?

I want to be in great shape when the XC season starts because there are tryouts and the meets start within a week or two.

433,AdvancedRunning,Fabulous-Mistake151,Race prediction from this sub?,"Took some of 2019 - and most of 2020 off from running and had a PR of 1:17:12 In the half. I was running around 50-60 mpw when training. It was during a Boston training block. I have a half coming up In a month and want to repeat that time. I started in January, but have been averaging 40 mpw since then, with a few 50s. If training goes according to plan I’ll be hitting 60s for the next 4 weeks, no taper for the race, cause I’m in another marathon block. The race is exactly 1 month out and I’m curious if anyone thinks it’s reasonable for me to run that same pace (5:53) again for the half I have coming up. I’ve been completing all the workouts. Had one week with a hamstring issue, but it’s been resolved mostly.

Are there any key workouts that would indicate anything or can I rely on some muscle memory to help me out?

Workout Examples I’ve done recently 

I did an 8 m temp at 6:12, and it didn’t feel terribly difficult. It was supposed to be a MP workout. 

Also I did a 4x400, 10 min tempo, 4x400, 10 min tempo, 4x400. 400s we’re around 1:17 avg. Tempo was around 5:58-6:00. Again not terribly difficult.

Lastly 12x1k @3:30-3:25 with 1 min rest between reps and 3 min between sets. 

I have a workout today that is as prescribed…

Run 15 minutes @HMP (3 min standing recovery)
Run 10 minutes @HMP (3 min standing recovery)
2-4 sets of 5 min @10k (3 min standing recovery between each)

Any ideas what I should run this workout at to set my HMP?

&gt; (1) The biggest benefit of heat acclimation may be plasma volume expansion. Just as altitude stimulates your body to produce more red blood cells, heat stress stimulates your body to produce more plasma. The result is a greater cardiac output, and higher VO2 at a given effort level. In the New Zealand study, resting plasma volume increased by 4.5%, even though the the athletes had very high plasma volume to start; in the Oregon study, plasma volume increased by 6.5%.

But outside of running, I have been thinking about breathing quite a bit: In yoga, you're often told to inhale through your nose and out through your mouth. They also talk about deep breathing / belly breathing / diaphragm breathing. 

I recently read the book ""Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"" and the major thesis of the book is that inhaling through your nose is better, though the author is talking about day-to-day life, not running in particular. 

I also heard about Wim Hoff though that book, and found this [interesting breathing exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) on youtube. 

Watching the Olympics, it got me thinking about how athletes seek to maximize and hone every aspect of their body and technique, and so I wonder if elite runners do anything different breathing-wise...

I'm pretty much a self-taught runner, so I never had coaches or anything in track or cross country, because I didn't do those in HS (I was a soccer player).

472,AdvancedRunning,Lou_Garet,Need advice on getting sick in prime training weeks,"Sitting here writing this after what was supposed to be my last long run I’m my marathon training block, 3 weeks out from race day. I had 23-24 @ 7:15ish/mile on the schedule and was hoping to be feeling strong and confident. In reality, I just barely squeaked out 14.4 @ 8:10 and was absolutely falling apart at the end, going well over 9:00/mi for the final couple. 

Last week I came down sick with what I think was a bad cold (got the Covid test and it came back negative). Symptoms just seemed to linger all week but I managed a 6 and an 8 miler towards the end of the week. Today I was hoping to at least get 15 in and get back to feeling relatively normal again. From the start I was fighting it to try to hold decent form and keep the heart rate down. Just still felt off but was hoping my body would get loosened up  and start rolling along easy. 5-6 in I felt ok and held around 7:30 pace but it fell off from there. Slowly bleeding pace until the wheels fell off around 12-13. Jogged it home feeling completely discouraged. Goal time for race day was 2:55. Right now I’m seriously debating calling it off completely. 

So the decision now is where do I go from here. Do I keep grinding it out? Do I just take rest days until I’m back at 100%? Adjust the goal for the race? Any advice appreciated",1628353709
473,AdvancedRunning,robert_parkr,Running plan for 3 days a week,"Hi, 

I am 48 y/o and started running in September 2020. In November 2020 I got a degenerative median meniscus tear. My physiotherapist advised me to only run three times a week for the longevity of my knee.

How much I can maximum run each day if I run only 3 times a week without increasing my risk for injury? 

I wanted to do the red plan of Jack Daniels but that has 4 times a week running as a minimum.
So I am thinking of a week A and week B. 
Week A: two easy runs of 1 hour and one long run of 2 hours. 
Week B: two runs with a mix of easy runs and threshold/interval runs and one long run of 2 hours. 

Does that make any sense?

My goals are to increase my fitness and to stay healthy and fit while I get older. 

I train also 3 times a week with kettlebells.",1628349312
474,AdvancedRunning,dontinterruptm--,Competing with General Anxiety Disorder,"Hey all. In recent months I have been dealing with lots of anxiety and OCD-related issues, and it has created this negative feedback loop with my running. I’ll have an upcoming race, then I’ll get nervous about it, and the anxiety will cause me to have diarrhea and stomach cramps to the point where I cannot—or can barely—compete. The other day I got through a 5k but was stuck in the bathroom constantly the rest of the day.

I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has ever gone through something similar, and, if so, how they dealt with it? It’s been a few months now. Thanks in advance!",1628349081

Garmin says my hr should be below 158 for an easy run. But I hear the talk test and I didn't have anyone to run with tonight, so I was just going by my breathing. I figured so long as I could breath through in and out only through my nose, it was an easy pace. 
I was still breathing easy albeit deeply through my nose. But heart rate kept creeping up to 161, even whole breathing easy. I was running about 9:30 pace. 
So I decided to test the breathing test. I just kept running faster while I could still breathe easily through my nose. Mile 5, I ran at a 8:30 pace and was still breathing in and out only through my nose (I was breathing faster through my nose, but never felt like I wasn't getting enough O2). 
My heart rate was about 175. This happen to anybody else?
How do you guys judge easiness to keep your easy runs truly easy?

I live in Louisiana and the humidity has been absolutely brutal lately, so I’m tempted to do the workout on the treadmill, but I’m worried this won’t adequately prepare me for the race. I’m pretty sure that I won’t be able to complete the run in 80 degree, 100% humidity weather (before the sun comes out); but I’m certain I can hit goal pace on the treadmill and still feel like I’m getting work in. I need help deciding if I should do the long run on the treadmill or outside.

Pros of doing the workout on the treadmill: I have no doubt I can complete the workout at goal pace; it will still be a little warm in the room where I run; I want my legs to get used to running 6:25-6:30/mile pace for longer periods and I don’t think I can get this kind of turnover in this weather; I can simulate Boston’s hills on the ‘mill

Cons: for some reason my brain tells me I’m cheating because I probably couldn’t complete the workout outside, even though I know it’s 100% only because of the weather.",1628271689

492,AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Persistent Injury Weakpoints,"Hey all,

So to clarify for the mods, I am not asking for specific injury advice although I will share the area I've been dealing with. I'm more curious in folks luck dealing with their ""injury weak points"", or in other words the parts of their body that always seem to get hurt first. After several years of running you've probably run into one, generally for me they show up when I'm adding lots of elevation or fast mileage. I've tried all the basic protocols and none of them have been the ""easy fix"" they can be for noobs, and I wanted to get an idea of what those of you that've been successful have done to finally see the back of these persistent weak points.

To clarify a bit, my ""weak point"" is generally my Left IT band. I haven't had to skip a run for injury in over 2 years, and I haven't actually had my IT-Band be aggravated to the point of missing a run in something like 4. However, occasionally I'll feel the tightness in the lower knee pop up after speed workouts or tough long runs. It doesn't seem consistent or follow a pattern, and a series of weightlifting programs, SAM/MYRTL type routines, gait fixes, and weight loss haven't had it gone for good. 

To be clear, its gotten massively better. However, my ideal goal would be to get this feeling essentially the same as the rest of my legs. At this point I'm wondering if the cause is either

1. Some complicated biomechanical issue that hasn't been addressed by any of my routines or mobility work
2. Being caused by some non-running habit that's unduly stressing out the left leg. 

\#2 might seem a bit wonky or a bit of an excuse to some folks, but I have made lifestyle changes before that have had seen the back of several issues. Just for example, I had some persistent pain in my right hip that my doctor hypothesized might be due to hip impingement. Cue a high grade existential crisis over the future of my running. After about a year I realized the wonky angle in my car's driver seat was probably fucking up my hip. Now I drive sitting on top of a pillow, and problems are solved. 

So I'm curious, have you been able to permanently ""fix"" a consistent weak point of yours? If so, what was the fix?",1628214152

496,AdvancedRunning,hail0049,Need advice moving forward.,"Hello everyone,

This might be a bit long, so I appreciate your time.

Background: I am a 23 year old male. As for my running history, I ran one season of track in high school where I ran a 5:28 mile. Did not have any formal training at that time, and did not pursue running again until August 2020.

I started running again at the end of last August, as mentioned before. I began training using the Jack Daniels Running Formula (5k/10k plan), and went through a base phase of 6 weeks of light running, calisthenics, and strides. I ran a 2 mile time trial in 14:08 (roughly equivalent to a 22:30 5k). I began incorporating repetition workouts, tempo runs, v02 max workouts (such as 5X1000m, 4X1200) and ran 20:43 for the 5k at the end of October. I continued this training, and built my mileage to around 30 miles a week, and ran 19:56 for the 5k at the end of November.

After a grueling winter, I ran a 18:55 5k pb in March of this year. I stopped running in April due to a nervous breakdown, along with my Hashimoto's Thyroiditis symptoms worsening (it's an autoimmune condition). I switched to biking instead as I felt it was not as intense on the legs and I am getting treatment for both aforementioned health issues. 

In mid July 2021, I resumed running again and was shocked at how much fitness I lost, considering I was still physically active through cycling during my 2.5 month period away from running. I was barely able to run a mile at 6:25 pace. I resumed my training plan (adjusting paces of course) and ran a 20:49 5k on July 28, two weeks after than 1 mile run attempt.

I have a goal to run under 18 minutes for the 5k (maybe around 17:55-17:59) and under 37:30 for 10k before my 24th birthday in early December. If I were to achieve this, it would make me happy in ways I just can't explain. I am willing to work hard and be consistent again to achieve this goal.

Now for my questions

1. Is this realistic? If so, how should I pursue this goal (Considering I have put in a lot of mileage in my legs over the past year along with my decent progression).
2. I have only been relying on the Jack Daniels Running Formula for training.

### Training
Lifelong runner who quit for a year and a half after college. I have done basically nothing but base building since January of 2019. Since then, I've faced setbacks and injuries which prevented me from getting properly into a 5K training plan. Over the last year though, I’ve established a baseline mileage of 20-25mpw and have been following Pfitzinger’s Faster Road Racing, so I do a long run and strides or a tempo each week. No 5K specific workouts though. I kept telling myself I wasn't ready or hadn't done enough training to race a 5K, but really I was probably just afraid that I wouldn't be happy with whatever time I was capable of doing, or that I wouldn't be good enough compared to my past self.

I was going to start a 5K plan in June, but I had a flare up of ankle pain, took a week off, and cut back my mileage. I got a bit tired of continuously having to push my racing back, and I was dying to see what I am actually capable of these days. In October 2018, just before I officially got back into running, I managed to knock out a 19:30 5K, so that is where I set my sights.

### Race Strategy
I wanted to make sure I was in control the whole time so I aimed for an even split for most of the race, and whatever I had left in the last mile/half mile I would just put it all on the line. I set a pace target for somewhere between 19:00 - 19:30 pace to allow me to adjust my pace depending on how I was feeling at mile 1 and mile 2.

At mile 1, I wanted to be somewhere around 6:00 - 6:10, without going out too fast. At mile 2, I was hoping to be around 12:00 - 12:20. If I felt good, I would aim for 18:00 or faster for mile 3. If not, somewhere around 18:15-18:30 would be good. And then hopefully I'd have enough gas in the tank at the end for a kick.

### Pre-race
Woke up at 6am, threw on my clothes and shoes (no spikes just my regular ol’ trainers), packed a bag and drove over to the course. I have type 1 diabetes so I also had a sugary drink after I woke up to raise my blood sugar, since running always brings me low. I felt incredibly nervous most of the time I was getting ready.

When I got to the course, I warmed up for 10 mins, starting out at an easy/recovery pace and slowly working up to tempo-ish pace towards the end. I did some dynamic warmup stretches, knocked out a few strides, and got on the starting line. My fiance generously agreed to my race official, so she gave me my commands and started her watch.

### Race
Went through 1K at 3:40, a bit fast but I was feeling good. I tried to reel it in a bit and settle into a 3:48km / 6:07mi pace. 

My 2K split was 4:05 on the watch, but the area I was going through was pretty wooded so I think the GPS could’ve lost me for a bit so it might have been a bit faster.

I am fully expecting this to end up on r/RunningCirclejerk: my 3K split was 4:02, but I was in trouble: I suddenly felt like I desperately had to use the bathroom. My pre-race nerves had prevented me from taking care of that beforehand. I had to actually stop for 15 seconds or so to get my bearings, but the clock kept ticking. I was feeling really dejected at this point but I convinced myself I had to keep going even if it wasn’t a perfect effort.

At 4K my split was 4:04, and again I felt my body rebelling against me, so I had to stop for another beat. It was really discouraging but I made myself give whatever I had left for that final kilometer. 

I managed to make it across the finish line, and my fiance timed me at 20:00.04. Incredibly disappointing to be just 0.05s short of my most conservative goal, but all things considered, not terrible. I knew I had a lot more in me, and if I wasn’t running solo and I didn’t face those other issues throughout the time trial, I probably could have hit 19:30 or faster.

### Post-race
I was pretty dejected immediately after I finished. I drank a bit of water, hit the bathroom, and went on a 10 minute cooldown jog. 

I came to terms with what happened and told myself I can and will do better. Not every race is going to be perfect and we’re all going to have bad days, but it’s better to get out there and have a shitty day than not get out there at all. So overall, I’m glad that I went through with it, and I’m excited to try it again.

### What's next?
Probably going to continue building my base for the next month or two, hoping to establish a baseline of 25-30mpw. I am signed up for a 5K race in mid-November, so I want to transition to a 5K training plan with at least 8-10 weeks to spare before that.

501,AdvancedRunning,PM_ME_WARMASTERALFYN,How do you run fast for yourself?,"I ran a relay race today. It went very well, and I had a great time. I realized at the end of it, however, that I probably could have been less cautious with pacing my legs of the race. Specifically, I felt as if I was hesitant to push myself hard in the last leg of the race.

This seems to be a pattern for me: during track I'd routinely fall 20-30sec/mi pace slower than what I knew I could run. I feel as if I am unwilling to push myself hard in races.

Do you all have any advice to manage this? My current idea of what to do is that if I can push myself really hard in practice I can do the same in races. Any other ideas?",1628138911
502,AdvancedRunning,northernguy,Run/walk specs,"I’ve been testing out run:walk alternating, a la Higdon, and plan to try it in my next marathon (my 16th). Do other folks here do that? What has been your favorite ratio of walk to run times? Also, do you try to speed walk or just relax on the walk part?",1628118557
503,AdvancedRunning,Emil_1996,Some questions about what shoes to get,"So I have this problem, that my right foot is 1 full EU size bigger than my left foot, so 46 for my right and 45 for my left. It's also ""fatter"" on the height and who knows, it might as well be wider too cause it fits much, much harder than my left foot.

With my current shoes, that needs replacing, I literally have to wear 2 socks on my left to even make it somewhat similar, but it's still tighter on my right foot.   


I need new shoes for powerwalking/running and I don't know what to get, I got wide feet and I tend to walk a bit on the outside of my feet, so I need something that helps me stabilize my feet, as otherwise they tend to hurt sometimes when I run. 

Are the Nike Pegasus even an option for my wide feet or should I forget about them? They look nice and that's something important for me too, I don't want any boat looking shoes, I like them slim.  


Thank you.",1628117913

505,AdvancedRunning,GoyathlayA,Would someone like Kipchoge crush the ultramarathon times/distances?,"Looking at some of the record breaking ultramarathons, the people who ran them have good, but not elite marathon times. Obviously there is a lot more money and fame in marathons compared to Ultras, so the best genetically gifted distance runners are probably not doing Ultras. My question is if Kipchoge's 26.2 mile running ability would transfer directly to 50, 100, etc distances.

Our Principal Sponsor, John Hancock, would like to extend a bib to you for having one of the closest times to this year’s official qualification cutoff.  We’d like to celebrate that outstanding achievement and invite you to toe the line in Hopkinton this October. (Please note entry into the 2021 Boston Marathon is $230.)

 

We recognize that running this year’s marathon puts you on a shorter training regimen than usual. However, if you would like to participate, we will promptly share registration details. The deadline to register is approaching, so please advise on your decision by Monday, August 9.

We hope you will join us in Boston for the 125th running of the Boston Marathon. Congratulations!

It isn’t painful to touch and no swelling at all is visible. What exercises can I do to get back to running? In the mean time I’m going to swim to (hopefully) maintain my fitness— what are some good workouts that can simulate tempo runs and other summer-type workouts?,1628081062

We've only had like 15 days to train and via training I realized we'd probably be lucky to hit 65s and 75s, respectively. Do recreational runners or non-college athletes participate in these meets?

I’ve gotten by with some basic glasses with silicon nose pads, but they’re pretty much toast, and in general we’re horrible with sweat.

515,AdvancedRunning,NotTheTrueKing,Is there room for improvement for a low-mileage runner?,"I used to run back in high school and never was able to scale up my mileage much due to injuries and breaks for various other reasons. In my last season in junior year, I did 20-30 miles a week (generally on the lower end) and ran a 5:28 mile after 2 months of training off a month's break. I'm wondering how much room for improvement I could possibly have with my PR's taking into account my mileage (I'm still in my 20's so I don't think age would affect me too much). 


For additional context, I ran for a bit a year ago after another lengthy break (4 months), before lockdowns, and hit a 5:52 solo time trial mile off of inconsistent 20 mile weeks that I did over a period of 3 months. I'm guessing that effort would be closer to where I am right now (not training).",1628040946

520,AdvancedRunning,bigdog108277,Is this overtraining syndrome?,"I am a avid marathoner/ultramarathoner who has a coach and runs 40-60 miles per week on average and I typically do 2-3 marathons annually plus 1 ultra. I am getting older as I am in my mid 40’s and I seem to have hit a wall in the summer heat. I have been doing this for years so I thought I knew what it felt like. However, recently I have lost over a minute on my easy pace and some times struggle to even run a mile without my heart rate sky rocketing. I went to the doctor and had a full battery of blood work done and everything was normal. My coach had me take 4 days off but it did nothing. I feel ok when not running, it is just while doing the thing I love. Top end speed has also disappeared. I struggle to even reach the paces I ran whole marathons at just a few years ago.  I have dropped out of my 100 miler at the end of the year and feel totally devastated. Any thoughts?",1628016754

Does anyone have experience carrying single stick packets and mixing those with water at aid stations? 

I’m prone to cramping so tailwind will be ideal given higher sodium/magnesium per serving. Something I need to practice during my training runs.

Any guidance or thoughts will be appreciated.",1628007457
524,AdvancedRunning,No-Pressure7867,What do I need to break 2 in the 800m and 4:30 in the 1600m?,"&amp;#x200B;

Gonna say this will be a long read, I'm sorry but there's a lot I need to say.

I'm an HS runner (16M) going into Junior year and XC season is about a month away. I improved by massive amounts over the spring, going from 5:28 to 4:52 in the 16, 2:24 to 2:09 in the 8(ran this time on a track that was basically half concrete, teammates said that would've been 2:08-06 on a better track), and 11:40 to 10:59 in the 32. I credit a large amount of these improvements to being a lot healthier and improving my mobility/flexibility after having \~5 months of injury total beforehand. I've made it a personal goal to make it to states in the open 8/16, which in my region is a 2:00/4:30 respectively. I'm still not sure if those are actually my best events or if I still have a bad aerobic base from my injuries, which weren't very long ago. This is where the 5k comes in. I've always had a very mediocre time (19:20), and I'm not sure if I'm just naturally not wired for endurance (I do heavy positive splits in all my races, the 2:09 was 60-69) or if I'm just lazy with my aerobics(like mile reps, long tempos and long runs), which my teammates have told me, but I always make sure to feel like I'm working like I should when I do them, e.g I felt out of breath going 8:00 for an 8 mile long run, which is awful in my team. So that makes me wonder if grinding for around sub 17 in the 5k will give me enough endurance to be able to hold the paces needed to break 2 and 4:30. Another thing that I've been trying to do is getting back into the weight room. I've done it before in the summer of 2020 before my first injury. However looking back on it I was doing it very incorrectly, this time I'm incorporating things like plyometrics and more stability exercises, and doing more quality than quantity in lifting, but I'm not sure as to how I should structure myself there, a high schooler designing workouts makes for a pretty disorganized schedule.

TL;DR Got a lot faster after injury, want to get faster but not sure if my aerobics are holding me back and how to incorporate lifting/plyometrics progressively and safely.

What do you think? Sorry if the post is so long",1628005700
525,AdvancedRunning,StrangeMorris,Tiredness after higher intensity runs,"How do other busy individuals deal with being tired after more intensive runs? I eat well and get the best night's sleep I can. I'm sure having kids has something to do with it, but it's annoying because it makes me want to not push myself hard because I don't want to be tired the next day.",1627998613
526,AdvancedRunning,DunnoWhatToPutSoHi,Perhaps not an advanced question - but regarding nutrition,"So, if anyone watches youtube of like distance runners triathletes etc you see them taking all these supplements. Say nick bare - strong greens, reds, joints etc etc. 

My question, as an average runner looking to to do my first marathon in October (preferably under 4 hours) would any of this kind of stuff be useful or is it just them trying to sell stuff for themselves or sponsors? My diet incorporates plenty of vegetables etc (and chocolate unfortunately, need to lose a few lb but that's another story). Losing weight would do more for me than any of these supplements no doubt about it. But could something like strong joints alongside the diet benefit me in anyway or is it just people trying to sell things?

Alongside that if anyone has any suggestions of anything that would actually benefit your average runner fire away and it'd be much appreciated. I take electrolytes during long runs, protein powder from time to time &amp; a multivitamin but that's about it.

I’m trying to figure out how to differentiate creating workouts for 5k runners when contrasting 5k goal pace workouts vs. v02 max pace (3k pace). 

For example:

2(3x1k with equal rest between reps) 5m between sets at 5k goal pace. 

Or 4x1 mile at 5k goal pace with equal rest as a peaking workout.

I looked up some info online about correct bar position, and got better at it, but as soon as I increased weight, it hurt again. Any tips from a skinny person?

530,AdvancedRunning,cauthon,How long to safely/conservatively train from nothing to a half marathon?,"Hi,

I'm 31M in a bit of a unique situation. I ran cross country/track in high school, mostly gave it up in college, and have been running off and on for the past 6-7 years. I most recently ran 20-25mpw in 2019-2020, with some intent to build up to a half.

I had heart surgery this April to address a congenital defect, which obviously put my training on pause. I've been working with cardiac rehab for the past month to safely resume exercise, and I'm currently doing about the equivalent of the first week of couch to 5k (~20min of 60-90s intervals on a treadmill). 

I'd still like to train for a half, and I'm curious how early would be reasonable to run one if I'm primarily interested in completion rather than time. (I'm curious from a running training/injury perspective, not a cardiac/medical perspective - I'm planning to stay in touch with rehab and they've been supportive of me resuming running.) I've thought about continuing with the C25k equivalent for the next month or two, then jumping into Hal Higdon's novice base + half plans, possibly targeting a mid April 2022 race. Would that be a reasonable goal, or should I give myself more time to build base to avoid injury? 

I've taken breaks from running before, but never for so long, and I always had other forms of exercise so I could jump back into running a few 5ks a week without much trouble. Restarting from scratch like this is new to me. I'd really appreciate any advice, I'm primarily interested in figuring out what goals make sense for me and resuming a training schedule without injury. (And if this isn't sufficiently ""advanced"" for the subreddit please let me know and I'll post elsewhere.)

Thanks!",1627937910
531,AdvancedRunning,ngomaam,Product Review: District Vision Junya Racer sunglasses," [Junya Racer Black, D+ G15 — District Vision](https://districtvision.com/products/junya-racer-black-d-g15) 

Just wanted to offer a brief review of these sunglasses. Aside from the style (which is subjective ofc, but I think it looks very good but in a more conservative way I guess - I have a smaller oval face), these are the best sport sunglasses I've tried. Granted, I haven't tried a lot (Goodr, Oakley, some random Amazon brands), but I have no complaints with these at all. Super light and zero bounce when running at any pace, have never had to even slightly adjust once I put these on. They fit over my beats power beats pro headphones and does not interfere with that hook, nor does placing the frame arms on the headphone hook alter the stability or position of the glasses. I'm also asian, and there's no ""asian fit"" offered here, but it fits perfectly over my flatter asian nose. The lightness and flex also make it very comfy to wear on your head or over a hat. 

Have not experienced any fogging at all, although I don't live in a humid area, but it has been more humid than average lately, and my last run was ran in about 60% humidity. 

I also use these for cycling, and again, no complaints there at all, with the same pros listed above. I haven't tested the durability of these but I can't imagine these not lasting forever with proper care. 

My complete head kit: Satisfy running hat, beats powerbeats pro and these shades. It's an investment but it has been completely worth it imo.",1627936521

I'm confused by this, but maybe I'm overthinking it. Would you interpret this as a recommendation for a 2 mile warmup + 2 mile cooldown on top of a 10k race?

I am due to run London Marathon in 9 weeks. So, what would you do to get to the start line in as best shape as possible? I wanted to run a PB effort and I have a soft PB of 3:03, off minimal training. I am 40-50 mpw when in a marathon cycle.

So, **defer**? (The defer guidance is due out on 17th August. Although I have a GFA place from 2019, so am not hopeful this will be an option to me).

**Rest** and take another week off and do an 8 week plan.

541,AdvancedRunning,eled34,Looking for encouragement - NYC Marathon,"Hi All,

I’m looking for some encouragement/guidance on goal-setting for the NYC Marathon in November. I ran it in 2018 as my first marathon and finished in 4:46. 

Since then, I caught the bug and have been through 3 years of running, averaging anywhere from 20-70mpw generally. Ran 3 marathons independently in a six month span while backpacking in 2019 and have spent 2 summers training heavy in FL/TX heat. I’m ignoring the times from the 3 marathons, as I had no aid stations and was firmly bonking by the second half in all of them (all run in 70-80+ degree heat too).

I’m looking ahead to November and would be so pumped if I could shave an hour off my original 4:46 time. I comfortably ran 10 miles this AM in 80-90+ degree heat with hills mirroring the worst of NYC at a 9:06 clip, staying aerobic (Z1-Z2) for the whole run. Am fairly confident I could hit 1:45-1:50 if I pushed maximally on a half in perfect conditions right now, just don’t want to get hurt trying.

Do you think the 3:46 time is achievable? Any encouragement would be awesome, thanks!",1627858396
542,AdvancedRunning,moose_truce,Top of the foot pain for the last 6 months,"In mid March, I started to develop a top of the foot pain on the right side of my mid left foot, around the first and second metatarsals. It's a pain which is more like tightness, feels like there's almost excess tension that needs to be released. I've felt this before and usually just roll my foot on a tennis ball to massage and stretch it out. This time around it hasn't worked. I adjusted my running schedule until completely stopping on march 30. 

I've seen 2 podiatrists, have had multiple x-rays, and an MRI. Nothing obvious shows up on any of the readings. One podiatrist says it looks like a sprain and could possibly be a stress fracture; he also said my 2nd and 3rd metatarsals are too close together and my 1st is a couple of millimeters shorter than it should be. The other said she didn't see any signs of fractures. We all kind of agreed that it might be extensor tendonitis but nobody has given a straight answer. 

Leading up to the pain, I was doing a lot of treadmill running. Probably 20-25 mpw on the tread and another 10-20 on the roads or trails. 

My feet are pretty flat. My favorite shoes are the Saucony Kinvaras. I don't use inserts; I did cave and pay for orthotics which I haven't received yet. I've been running since I was 18 and now am 26. I'm a slow runner (around 10min pace average), weekly mileage varies (anywhere from 30s to 50s usually, sometimes more if I'm training for a race). I like to run ultramarathons but haven't since covid started (last one was September 2019, 100miler). 

In hopes of fixing this issue I used crutches for 3 weeks, which did relieve some of the pain. But it's still there and just continues to get worse as I use it (started walking dogs about a mile a day a week ago, have since stopped). I'm thinking about crutching around again but it's been almost 6 months of no running and minimal walking. Really not sure what else to do to make it better. Any recommendations? Would a stress fracture or extensor tendonitis last this long? 

 I'm starting grad school in the fall and will not have enough time (or good enough insurance) to see more doctors.",1627848593

After stepping away from racing I started heavy lifting for aesthetics for ~10 years and gained a significant amount of mass.

I’ve been putting more of my focus on marathons the last 2 years and I honestly think that endurance training will benefit my health and lifestyle more in the long run as opposed to excessive mass.

I’ve been on a strict diet and running 60 - 80 miles a week over that last 2 years. I did lose a lot of weight initially, I look very lean/cut, but I’m still 30 lbs over my old racing weight. I’ve hit a plateau in my weight loss and my running progress probably over the last 6 months.

I’m obviously not gonna starve myself or put myself in an eating disorder as that would be terrible for my health.

547,AdvancedRunning,gimlidorf,Jack Daniels 1500m to 3000m plan,"Hello all,

Just curious to know if anyone has used the JD 1500m to 3000m plan

I'm 33M casual runner. 5k pb 19.15. I've upped my mileage from 30km per week for many years to 60-70 over the last 12 months with long runs of 18-25km. 

I quite enjoy the faster shorter distances and the speed work which goes with it so I thought I'd give it a go. 

I have two questions in particular.

1)The first 2 phases of JD's plans have alot of 200/400 reps where the goal is to run fast to improve techinque/economy. The recommended time is about your 1500m time. (Or whatever is in the Vdot table). Is there any harm in running these faster? (Kinda fun to go a bit quicker!)

2)JD recommends long runs upto 25% of mileage. This is common thing in many of his plans from what I can see. With 70km this would be upto 18km long runs. If I feel fine doing longer runs (usually 21-24km every second week) is there any down side?

Thanks

548,AdvancedRunning,FigDramatic,"Anyone else lean, but weights a lot","This is going to be a dumb post, but its something that's been rattling around my brain for a long time.

I am 6ft tall, but I weight 185 pounds. I know BMI is flawed, but that puts me in the overweight category. I do actually feel heavy when I run and I suspect my weight could be a (even if small) factor in injury or muscle fatigue.

Here's the thing. My waist is 31 "" and my abdominal muscles are visible. I don't have much fat around my gut area, its only if I sit down that I can pinch some stomach. The same with my arms and legs, no visible fat. Everyone I run with comments about me being lean and looking in shape.

I often put on my wifes t-shirts by mistake and she weights 110 pounds.

I am a high mileage runner (well high for me), I always hangout around 50 miles a week.

I do very little weight lifting and have no past as someone who focused on developing muscle. My cross training is on a bike (when I don't run I do an hour or so on zwift with a smart trainer).

This is not even a calroies in / calories out question. I can limit calories, but then I notice my training trends down and I just don't feel great. Starving all the cold just that little bit easier. My diet is vegan. I mainly eat sweet potatos , brown rice, veggies and bananas. I replaced peanut butter for PB Fit (a powder with the oil removed).

Meanwhile I know guys who are 155lbs as a natural weight and I can't see a lot of difference in their frame size. Yet I am carrying the equilvant of a 16kg kettle bell.

I guess I just need to live with this and shut up / put up. But I needed to rant and see if anyone finds themselves in the same situation.

Let's be honest, if this is the total of my problems I am doing OK, but hey, I love running and like you all I look for anything which will see me improve.",1627796604
549,AdvancedRunning,homechefdit,Should I include super easy miles in weekly mileage?,"I'm training somewhat loosely for a virtual marathon. My plan was to run about 50 miles per week including a long run on Saturday that maxes out at 22 miles. I'm planning on running the marathon at \~9 min pace, most of my training is at 10-10:30, except for a track workout. It's my first marathon in a while but I've trained with a plan like this before, and am reasonably confident this will get me there. 

  
However, my daughter signed up for a half marathon and I decided to run with her during her training for company. She runs at approx 14-15 min pace all in (with walking as needed). Her plan goes from 15-25 miles per week. 

  
My question - should I include the runs with her in my 50 miles per week? They're easy pace, but a lot of time on feet. Today, for example, I ran 8.5 on my own, then 6.5 with her. Should I count this as a 14 mile run, less than 14 or (based on time on feet) more than 14?",1627792139
550,AdvancedRunning,Acoww123,How do I get back into running?,"Hello all! Sorry if the formatting is strange as Im on mobile. 

To make a long story short, I started running high school xc/track about 5 years ago, due to the Pandemic(and being sick the last week high school was in session with covid-like symptoms) I lost my last track season and honestly all motivation to run. I was never a D1 athlete at the sport but I always managed to do my distance runs and finish races with times I was proud of. 

However, ever since the pandemic between the covid 15 and the freshmen 15, Ive found it increasingly hard to get back into running shape and the old way of training I used to do doesn’t seem to be cutting it with keeping me motived to continue trying. I want to be able to run at least my peak 5k time by the end of the year (25-7/7:30/7:30ish) but I struggle finishing 2 miles at sub 19(8:30ish/10:30ish). Im honestly just feeling defeated and need some advice as to where to start. 

My old schedule was M-F. 
Monday: long day: 5-8 miles
Tuesday: easy medium-3-4miles
Wednesday: medium hard 4-5miles
Thursday: Track workout: 3-4miles fast paced.
Friday: medium day 3-4
Saturday: maybe a race if not no run
Sunday: no run ever. 

As Im still a full time student and have a part time job Id like to keep a similar schedule of M-F but once again Im not sure where to start. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you :)",1627782021

553,AdvancedRunning,benfullofswag,Questions about Daniels Half Marathon Training,"Hi everyone! I'm currently training for a half marathon using the Jack Daniels ""alien"" method (basically one T run per week, and alternating between one R/I run and one L/M run every other week). I like it because it allows for so much flexibility, but because of that flexibility I have some questions. 

1) How much to build up? I'm currently running 35-40 mpw. Not sure what to aim for as a peak, or how to strategize getting there. Does peaking not matter so much in training for a half as opposed to a full marathon?

2) How much to taper? The plan only has one week of taper before the race. Is that enough, or should I taper more? Does this also not matter as much in half marathon training?

3) I'm planning to do a tune-up 10K six-ish weeks before the HM. How should I pace myself for that? Should I go all-out (to update my VDOT score/change workout paces accordingly), or should I practice HM pace?

4) I'm also having trouble setting goals. My original hope was to go sub-1:30, but I recently did my first ever 5k-focused block of training and smashed my PR by over a minute (new PR 19:03). That was just before this HM-focused training block, and I used that time to calculate my VDOT paces, which suggest that 1:30 is very achievable for me at my current fitness level. 

For reference, my previous HM PR was 1:37 (part of buildup for a marathon in early 2019). During lockdown, I focused on building my aerobic base, and I've averaged 25-35 mpw over the past 18 months (all-time peak 48 miles). This is a lot more consistent mileage than I've ever done before (probably closer to 10-20 mpw for a couple of years), and I feel like I'm in the best aerobic shape of my life. Hoping to push myself in this upcoming HM. 

I really enjoy reading other people's experiences on this sub. Looking for any/all advice you have on my #breaking90project.",1627756601

555,AdvancedRunning,Hrdrock,Race Day Fluids,"Coming up on my first marathon in 4 weeks. I ran my first half marathon last year. The course was a repeated loop without designated aid stations, but I was able to drop a few bottles at the start/finish line and thus run bottle free. The marathon I’ll be doing next month will have a total of 12 aid stations with Gatorade/water at each. For my training runs I’ve been carrying a water bottle waist strap and consume anywhere from 500 mL for 8-10 mi up to 1.25 L for 15 mi runs. Judging how my training has gone, I’m assuming I’ll perform best in the marathon by consuming 1.5-2 L of total liquid over 26.2 mi. Id prefer to run without a waist strap, but I would like to make sure I can reasonably consume that much liquid just from the aid stations. 

How do you simulate this in your training? Take a water bottle but only drink every 3 mi to simulate the distance to each aid station? Also, thoughts on consuming Gatorade day of the race when I use Skratch drink mix for training?",1627740302

558,AdvancedRunning,_Vexation_,Goal setting for junior year.,"Hi y’all,

I’m just looking for what goals I should set for this cross country this year. I have three years running experience and am currently a 16 yo junior. I’ve only run in the summer one year before this summer at around 45 MPW with a max of 50 and then around 20-35 mpw in the season with two workouts intervals etc. This summer I’ve run 500 miles since the beginning of June or around 60 MPW (all in singles) since then and (unlike last summer) planning to keep this up for the rest of the season while including workouts (800 repeats 400 repeats tempos etc) just like in years before. My soph year PRs are 5k 17:29, mile: 4:55, 800: 2:09, 2 mile: 11:02 (5k split), 400: 56 high depending on race. My frosh year PR was 19:30 and we didn’t have track. What do y’all think I should set my goals for the 5k this year? Hoping for sub 16:15 or sub 16 but that may be a stretch and I’d like input. My most impressive workout last year was probably 8x800 with one minute rest in average 2:35 on sand of that makes any difference. Also recently (within the past week) did a half marathon easy long run average 7:20 pace while keeping HR at 160 if that makes any difference either.

559,AdvancedRunning,ChrisHeinonen,Pfitz 18/70 speed work,"I start the 18/70 plan next week for CIM (43 years old, sub-3:00 is the goal, but staying healthy is the main goal) and have a solid base of 45-55 mile weeks the past few months. But I also am going to go run Fifth Ave Mile in six weeks as part of my work team as we try to defend our title in the media mile against Runners World (thankfully during the recovery week of Pfitz). So I want to try to keep some speed work going the next 6 weeks to do that, as I've had to skip it the last three years due to injuries or COVID.

I was considering throwing in some speed work on one General Aerobic day per week (not replacing LT work or anything else) and not doing a ton of distance (1.5-2 miles maximum) for the speed just to stay fresh. Switching to 12/70 is an option, but seems worse. Or should I just hope I keep my mile fitness (5:11 earlier this summer) and follow Pfitz to focus on CIM, though I'd rather perform well at 5th Ave Mile than CIM I think.",1627690707
560,AdvancedRunning,UnnamedRealities,Evaluating time trial progress - weather adjustment?,"TL;DR: Do any of you apply a weather adjustment to normalize your time trials for monitoring progress and adjusting pace targets for workouts? In particular I'm interested in adjustments for mile and 5k time trials - anything from rough adjustments that are rules of thumb to fancy formulas and charts.

I'm training for a November HM (and December trail 50k) and I'm trying to run time trials every 3 to 5 weeks on the same day around the same time, but that's not always feasible because of rain and life constraints. One time may be right around sunrise when it's 69° with 80% humidity and overcast. The next time it might be 85° with 65% humidity mid-morning with no clouds. Worse still, I usually run 2.5 miles to get to the track - it's a nice warmup, but I'm going into the time trial half-soaked instead of dry coming out of an air conditioned building or vehicle.

What adjustment approaches do you use to normalize time trial results for distances like 1 mile and 5k?",1627686857

2) Rock the Endorphin Pros for the full 18 miles and let it ride baby.

572,AdvancedRunning,MrDilkington1,I'm at the end of my tether. I'm looking for knee recovery success stories. Please help.,"I'm not searching for medical advice, please don't bombard me with ""see a PT"". I'm simply searching for mental relief from my despair. I've never been so wrecked as I am right now, and not just because I cannot run but the running really saved me from my current situation. 

I've seen multiple PT's and nobody has an answer for me.

I started running about a year ago and worked my way up to about 30 miles a week. I did my first 30 miler after about 6 months of training and I did a 50 miler in January. This was all very quick, and with improper form and excessive training on rugged terrain and trails combined with increasing my mileage from 30 to 50mpw in addition to steep hill training, I got injured. Big surprise. 

The injury is just a niggle. In both knees. In the medial area in the groove between femur and tibia. It might be my meniscus. It might be the plica. It might be the MCL. It might be the pes anserine bursa. It might be a different bursa. It might be the boogeyman. No idea. Nobody has an idea. The MRI has no idea. The X-ray doesn't either. The PT's have ideas and have no shame in hiding the fact they don't know which one it is. But they'll carpet bomb me with a range of exercises, which I have done with rigorous and meticulous focus. 

The injury started 3 months ago. I've been strengthening my glutes, my quads, and my hamstrings. Especially the quads and medial glutes. I've been foam rolling and stretching in addition to focusing on my hip flexors.

My legs are stronger. My anterior pelvic tilt is much less. My knees....are STILL complaining. If I run 6 miles a week, they complain for days. They don't like squats, or deadlifts either.

I really am not the wisest person in action, I think this is because of my mental health issues, poor self-esteem, and neurotic disposition to kicking the shit out of myself and forcing myself to work to a standard. It's very unhealthy and I've learned my lesson.

IF THIS THING PASSES,  I'm just going to build up 1 mile per week, and in 50 weeks ill finally, be at 50 miles per week. But I fear that it may never pass. What if this is permanent? Are my knees permanently damaged? There's nothing on the scans so it's not as serious as a tear....nobody seems to have an answer and I cannot describe the rage and frustration I feel about that. 

I want to be an ultra runner. I would like to achieve the 100 miler, the 200 miler and run in beautiful places around the world. I'm even learning Spanish so I can permanently live there because I think the running locations are just amazing. I love running, but I'm afraid that I've ruined myself.

With my depression, poor position in life, and just generally terrible mental health I'm in a pit of despair. It's becoming perfectly clear that my running dreams are shattered, but I hope this is just the illusion posed by my disastrous mindset.

Please. Someone. Someone experienced knee injuries or something. Someone who fell into the same traps as I have and fucked up the same way I have. What did you do? Did your knees get better? Did you come back stronger and achieve the things you wanted?

Are 3 months a reasonable time for irritation of the plica, or irritation of the meniscus, or irritation of the pes anserine bursa, or some variant of PFPS, or some issues caused by poor knee tracking to recovery usually? Or is it perfectly normal for this span of time to elapse and still be struggling?

Just please someone tell me a positive fuckin story I can relate to...

Thanks if you got this far, sorry for causing your eyes to go into the back of your head too.",1627496703

My problem is the mental game, I'm trying my hardest to leave my ego at the door, but my heart rate is super high even at a 9:30+ pace on my easy days and I'm exhausted.  I did my longest training run this weekend so far 13.1 miles at about a 9:30 pace and just feel super defeated.  I try to go early in the morning, but I still work east coast hours, so I log in at 6:30am.. it's not always possible!

How can I adjust my training plan to meet my new environment? I feel constantly out of shape and I'm worried I'll just keep pushing myself harder and harder and continue to be disappointed. I appreciate any links to training plans or articles about training at elevation.  I'm extremely competitive and goal oriented so this has been a tough training cycle for me.",1627493521
574,AdvancedRunning,blxcklst,Salomon vs Camelbak hydration vests for long trail runs?,"I'm looking to buy a hydration vest that can be used with a bladder, for 30+ mile (ideally up to 50/100 mil distances but I've got a 30 mile mountain race in 2 months so primarily for that!) trail runs, usually quite hilly so it's at least 6 hours at a time (my 30 miler will have aid stops every 10 miles but i'd rather be overprepared than under).

I'm guessing the most popular advice would be Salomon Adv Skin 5 or 12, but at the moment I use Camelbak Octane Dart for my training runs up to 20 miles and I'm loving the bladder set up, although obviously not enough storage space for other things - Camelbak Circuit 1.5 L seems to be like an obvious upgrade.

Is there a reason why Camelbak hydration vests aren't that popular, am I missing something? How good are Salomon bladders when used with Adv Skin 5? Do they leak at all?

Bonus question for women: has anyone bought either Camelbak Circuit 1.5 Women's, or Salomon Adv Skin 8 (the one designed specifically for women's build) vests? Would they be worth investing? I'm usually a bit wary of any unisex gear or clothes because of different fits!",1627492370
575,AdvancedRunning,brwalkernc,Workout of the Week - Yasso 800s,"Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent  specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas:

* A new workout
* An oldie but goodie workout
* Nailed a workout
* Failed a workout
* A race report that doesn't need its own thread
* A question about a specific workout
* Race prediction workouts
* ""What can I run based on this workout"" questions

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is Yasso 800s**.

*History:*

Invented by Bart Yasso, a writer for Runner's World.

*What:*

Yasso 800s in theory are supposed to predict your marathon time: your time in minutes and seconds for a workout of 10x800 meters with equal recovery time is the same as the hours and minutes of your marathon time. 

For example: 10x800 in 2:45 per rep with 2:45 recovery should mean you can run a 2:45 marathon.

*When:*

Pretty obviously it is for marathon training. MacMillan recommends doing two or three Yasso 800s spread out through your marathon cycle. The creator of the workout says to start several months out from your marathon and work your way up from 4x800 to 10x800, peaking 2 weeks before the goal marathon.

________________

*Note that this is just a theory. I'll be honest - I've seen more people claim is doesn't work than those that claims it does work. But hey, on the bright side it still gets you 8k of speedwork! And if you do try it out, let us know how well it predicted.*",1627479724

&gt; The U.S. Center for SafeSport has barred coach Alberto Salazar permanently from track and field citing sexual and emotional misconduct, according to its centralized disciplinary database on Monday.

&gt; Under SafeSport rules, Salazar has 10 business days to request arbitration, which would be conducted by an independent party. SafeSport declined to comment on Tuesday.

This has come in largely under the radar as there doesn't appear to have been an announcement, just an updating of his database entry. It appears to be independent of his doping ban but Mary Cain went on record with how bad her personal experience under Salazar was.

So I just completed my first marathon over the weekend (4:44). It was nothing fast or fancy but my goal was too cross the finish line and I did just that. My question was, I was planning on signing up for a trail marathon in October and was wondering is this too soon to get back at it? This whole week has been dedicated to recovering (stretching/rolling out etc) and next week I planned on going on a few light runs at super low intensity.

Klecker finished a strong third in the 10,000m at the U.S. Olympic Trials last month to make his first Olympic team. He ran ridiculously even splits, going out in 13:58ish &amp; coming back in 13:56ish for his final time of 27:54.90.

This is pretty much his entire build.

Ritz started coaching him on the Week of May 25 and you can immediately see his fingerprints on it. If you don't know, a famous workout that Ritz loves is the ""Ritz Fartlek"" or the ""Double Ladder,"" where it goes 1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2-1 with equal rests. That workout crushes mere mortals, but Klecker does it as part of a 15 mi morning, followed by a 5 mi double.

More recently I started running again. I am on week 4 or 5 of my 18 week marathon training, with the race in mid October. I’ve done many half marathons, too many shorter races to count, and 2 successful marathons with a pace I’m very happy with, so I’m an experienced runner. 

For this race I am focusing a lot more on healthy eating, recovery, and drinking less. 

I’ve never lifted weights during an intense running schedule, and I’m not so sure its a good idea. 5x5s start every session with squats, which I’ve cut out completely. 

Has anyone done any sort of complimentary lifting program that doesn’t detract from; or better yet: enhanced your running? If the answer is simple “don’t do it” use your off days for better recovery and stretching, that makes total sense to me.

590,AdvancedRunning,consolationLog,Choosing a target marathon time after two new PRs,"Hey guys,

I started \[30M\] running about 2 years ago and only the last year and a half of that has been consistent 5+ days/week running. Once I had an aerobic base that allowed me to run almost everyday without feeling like death, I started doing Hal Higdon plans then Pfitzinger. Recently though, I've just been running 6 days a week, repeating something that resembles mid-plan Pfitzinger with most runs being about an hour at easy pace, with one tempo workout, and finishing with a Sunday long run of 2-3hrs. I hover anywhere from 50-70 miles a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[ran my first solo marathon in 3:27 in April\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mkp58e/first\_ever\_marathon\_32752/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mkp58e/first_ever_marathon_32752/)) then did a 30 miler in May for my 30th birthday at a slightly slower pace. Recently in the past two months though, I've made some major lifestyle changes that have resulted in what feel like massive boosts to my fitness: I quit drinking caffeine and quit smoking weed. Both have been major vices in my life and somehow, I was smoking everyday while building fitness the entire time. I even ran the 30mi high as hell!

&amp;#x200B;

After the mild withdrawal period ended, I attempted a 5k on the track with the intention of trying to hold onto 6min/mi pace. To my surprise, I ran a 17:49 and stuck to 5:45/mi pace with no issue. It even felt like I had left a little in the tank, but I was more than happy with the result. Two weeks later, I decided to try a 10k (again on the track) and held a pace just above 6min/mi for a time of 37:43. 

&amp;#x200B;

I intend on running my first official marathon in Napa Valley, USA in March which has a negative net elevation and seems like a PR friendly course. Originally, I thought that based on my April marathon I would attempt to stick to 7:20/mi pace, but after these last two efforts, I feel like I may be selling myself short? To give a little more perspective, I ran a 23mi long run yesterday at 7:53/mi (stupid and unnecessarily long for a training run, I know) with my HR in zone 2 for 80% of the run. My ultimate goal is to qualify for Boston which seems to require something like 2:52:00 for my age group. 

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely don't expect to run that fast anytime soon but would a sub-3 outing my first time out be unrealistic? I see people in this sub with slower 5k/10k times who have comfortably cracked 3 hours so that seems pretty encouraging to me. The Jack Daniels training calculator estimates a 2:54 marathon time based on my 10k PR, but that sounds ambitious as hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I've built up a lot of faith in my body/legs and believe that with more consistency, I can achieve a lot more. I sort of have a chip on my shoulder after years of squandered potential smoking weed and wasting time. I quit cross country in high school after making varsity Freshman year, and the memory of that brings me a lot of shame. I recently looked up the collegiate times of my former teammates who I was naturally faster than back then, and they set PRs in the sub 15min range for 5k and sub 32min for 10k. I know this probably sounds dramatic, but I'm on a personal mission to make the most of the waning years of my youth.",1627353087

I'm a former powerlifter with a few years of decent running experience behind me. My running has improved drastically but looking back it's pretty pathetic for the amount of work I've put in. For example i hit a 19:16 5km 3 years ago running just 25km a week with a heavy emphasis on speed. I Pb'd about 6 months ago with 18:16, i went for a 5km today and hit 20 minutes. I weigh less and have ran substantial blocks of training with anywhere from 70km&gt;120km a week. I run every day and stress about this a lot. The amount of work I put in feels incredible and to regress is so de-motivating. 

I have tried a mixture of high mileage/easy miles ect...and am a bit lost on what to do now. The general advice i read on here is ""do more easy miles"" but i've done that! I mix up easy runs with threshold runs and then speed work, my program ""seems"" to be pretty good. I've read marathon training and jack daniels formula. i just don't know where i'm going wrong.

The outlying factors for me (compared to the average distance runner)

1 - i weigh about 200lb (this is mostly muscle, i used to train for bodybuilding/powerlifting for 10 years)

2- I still train with reasonably heavy weights (probably a 500lb squat, 400 bench and 550 deadlift). This likely adds to my fatigue

Based on the above info what are your initial thoughts? My mental health isn't great with this to be honest, all i do is think about running and training. When you try so hard (run every day/doubles alongside weights and regress it's hard to take.

This will be my first time trying Pfitz AND my first ever marathon. My goal is to run sub-3, and I know I have the speed, but I need some more endurance. I was preparing for 18/70 last month, but I got sick (not covid) and even after I got better, training has fallen off because of work, vacation, and laziness.

I tried the first week and the HM pace run was on a very hot day in the sun, and I just couldn’t do it.

Some background about me, I started running again last year after not running regularly for about 5 years (I ran track and cross country in high school). I have since built up to running about 40 miles per week (with a down week of 20-25 mpw every 4th week). Truth be told, I haven't really been doing a lot of workouts or speed work. Every so often (1-2 times per month) I'll run at a medium effort for 3-5 miles (which for me is about 7:15-7:30 pace), but all of my other runs I do at an easy effort (usually 8:45 - 9:15 pace). I do, however, live in a pretty hilly area, so my easy runs on flatter surfaces are usually around 8:20 - 8:45 pace.

A couple of months ago I ran my very first half marathon. I didn't follow a training plan or anything (just the training I mentioned above). I ran it in 1:38. Miles 3-6 of the race were on this really uneven trail with a lot of big rocks and roots, so that made my legs burn like crazy. There was one steep hill after that portion, but the rest of the course overall was pretty flat.

Given those circumstances, I'm curious as to how much time I'm capable of dropping. I know the only way to find out is to continue running and give it time, but I'm curious as to what you all would predict. I would love to run under 1:30 one day. Do you all think that is possible?",1627265554

Hoping I am using the correct flair and in the proper subreddit for this type of question :)

I started running in August 2020.

I've done a 5k, 10k, and half marathon (end of May2021) all solo.

During this time, I've picked up a Garmin watch, handheld 18oz bottle, and a Nathan 5k belt that held my phone. 

The belt has now started to tear so I am possibly looking for a pack/vest to accommodate the longer miles I will be running in the future months. 

I have recently been running about 15-20miles a week, and will be picking that up as I am training for a couple half marathons in Sept/Oct.

I am looking for a pack/vest that holds \~50oz, that way I don't have to rely on family during my training. 

A big requirement for the vest/pack is its able to hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

First of all it looks like that the easy runs does not match up with their description of an easy run. In the plan you would be running 10min/mile, while the actual pace should be half a minute slower than your marathon pace, so 9min/mile. 

For the long runs it's the same story running above 9min/mile while 9 min/mile should be the speed. 

I did change the speed of the tempo runs as well, as I felt the times displayed in the schedule felt too easy.

Feel free to comment your opinion on this training plan. Maybe you tried it before or maybe you suggest a better alternative training plan.",1627234290
604,AdvancedRunning,Wolverines_Nan,5k Progression and some tips I've picked up on the journey.,"A mix of a race report and some tips I wanted to spread:  


I'm 29m and 6 years ago I ran my first 5k race at a Parkrun in 22:39.  
I'd already been training for about 6 months for it but was 23 and had never run before that other than to catch a bus. My girlfriend's dad ran a 16 min 5k that I thought was superhuman and I had it in my head that you had to run as a kid/ teenager to reach sub 17 territory. 

6 years later, I just ran a road 5k race in 15:35! 

So the first thing I wanted to say is that you don't have to be running as a kid to reach those sort of times. You just have to stick with the training for a long time.  
It's amazing how much our bodies can grow and adapt!

I do intervals once a week, workouts like 6 x 1200 with 200 jog recoveries, 800's at target 5k pace with 200 recovery as my favourites, occasional hill sessions and a 5 mile tempo run every few weeks with a long run on weekends ranging from 13 to 20 miles (Mostly 20 miles).  
I would speculate though that more than the specific workouts, it's consistency, weekly miles and running over time that's where the improvements have come.   
I was running about 35 miles a week to manage 18:50 5k's. I was still doing the workouts and intervals but done my easy runs a lot faster in comparison to my race pace than I do now. (Easy runs were about 7:45-7:25 pace looking at my Strava while nowadays they're about 7:40 to 7 min pace).  
That's probably why I used to get injured so much. I've had ITB injuries putting me out for 4 or 5 months at some stages, sciatic pain that put me out for an entire summer and all sorts of ankle pains and niggles. I used to pay for physios, foam roll and all that stuff but I found if I got the same injury twice, both times I'd recover in the same amount of time, whether I got sport massages and ultrasound things that are supposed to get more blood to the muscles or if I just rested and did nothing.  
So nowadays if I get a niggle, I just rest for a few days. I think listening to your body is something that you learn over time. I read in a running science book that the reason behind a lot of injuries is that our muscles recover and grow quicker than our tendons and the tendons are the bits that get the typical injuries. So after upping your milage or training, your muscles feel like they can handle it and are doing fine but your tendons haven't kept up and get injured. So the point I got from that is to remember even if your muscles are feeling great after upping your training load, you don't know how far behind your tendons are so give them a rest.

I was hovering around 60 miles a week to go sub 17 and also run a 2:51 marathon.  
Now I'm more around 70 miles a week with some weeks at 85.   
I used to take rest days once or twice a week but I can handle a lot more now and work in months rather than weeks, so I'll have 3 weeks intense and then a recovery week of a few rest days and only about 50 miles and find that really works well for me.

Some other weird tips I've picked up are things like getting the maximum boost out of caffeine.   
So I read that our bodies grow stronger tolerances to substances like caffeine, where if we take it all the time, we don't get as much of a hit from it. Google told me it takes 2 weeks to lose the tolerance so if I've got a big race on, I'll completely avoid caffeine for 2 weeks (You have to watch out for chocolates and drinks that sneak it in) so when I take an energy gel an hour before a race, I get a massive rush, like my head's blasting off my body.

I know a lot of people that take beetroot shots before a race as well for the boost it gives but you can get a bigger boost if you take it for the whole week of the race. I drink a glass of beetroot juice every night; you get used to the taste over time.

I've found that to get quicker, you just have to devote more of your life to running. When I started, it'd just be half hour to an hour a few nights a week, building to an hour every night and now a point where the runs are an hour and a half but then you have half hour of strength training 2 or 3 nights a week, doing squats, hip thrusts and calf raises, time to prepare proper food (Which you should do anyway I guess, even not running) and 9 hours of sleep a night where I used to not bother about how long I slept. Basically running is like anything, where the more time you put into it, the better you'll get and there are no cheats or ways around that. 

So I think the best lesson I've worked out for improving running and maybe any hobby is to give it time, and the more time you devote to it, the better you'll get. Just stick with the training and it takes years to really improve, not months like I used to think.

Hope this helps to buy someone an extra few seconds in an upcoming race!",1627217166

606,AdvancedRunning,CrazyLegzDT,Running &amp; Keto,"So to preface, I've just picked up running again about a year ago, after a long layoff, and I've been doing a pretty solid keto diet for almost 6 months. I've got more energy than I ever have and my training is going extremely well.

I see a lot of advice on this forum and online in general about ""carbing up"" and replacing carbs post run. This isn't  new to me, I ran XC in high school and would always load up on pasta the night before a race.

This is an obvious contradiction though, and while I do intake some carbs, naturally through some sugars and starch, I definitely don't go out of my way to overload on carbs anymore. No pasta, no bread, no fast food, limited starch, low calorie/sugar sport drinks and grapes to refuel, a little CBD to take the edge off.

Is anyone else a keto-runner? Are there some positives or negatives? Anyone have any studies they could share in this regard? I guess I'm fishing for some research articles/personal experiences about this topic. I know sugar and glucose is the first thing to go but without having a ton of that in my system and running on ketones, how long can I realistically last? Is a ""keto marathon"" a possibility? Are there specific gel packs for keto runners? Should I still carb load before a race? My transition from glucose to ketones is working well during exercise (I think? 🤔, Lol).

I did a 15 mile run this morning and haven't had any solid carbs in about 2 weeks... Felt great, ran about 8:30 pace and finished really strong. I know there's a ""personal"" aspect to this but would you think my wall is coming soon after 15 miles? I see the majority of marathoners say around 20 or 22 is when they hit the wall.

Any advice, suggestions, comments would be appreciated. Thanks all!",1627152172

609,AdvancedRunning,NBeeLange,Big Toe Injury Experience,"Just a little background: I am a 29yo male who has been active my whole life. I love long distance hiking, rock climbing, and just being highly active. For the past year and a half I’ve taken a serious liking to running. I primarily run on trails, with eventual goals of mountain/ultra running in the future, gradually increasing my max distance, basically expanding on my biggest hobby of hiking. I have worked my way up to the point where I could comfortably run 30-35 miles per week, with the majority of it being on trails with a good amount of vertical (usually aim for 200ft/mile). As of now my longest run had been a 16.5mi trail run, and my current goal is a 30mi run through the NH mountains.

Around March I started dealing with some shin pain. I continued to run through it, however it continued getting worse as I continued to do nothing (as expected). By May I had to cut a 5mi slow recovery run short and walk home due to the pain. At this point I decided to take a month off for rest and re-evaluate. 

After the month off I felt great, and got back into a 15-20 mile/week schedule, avoiding road runs altogether. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, the pain was back nearly as bad as it was previously. At this point I went to PT to try and see mechanically if I was doing anything wrong. This is where I found out that I had a serious lack of mobility in my right big toe, and they believe the lack of mobility is causing a large amount of stress to be “relocated” to my lower leg. This was confirmed even more recently when I went to an Orthopedic surgeon for a true diagnosis. It was found that I possibly have some arthritis in my right big toe, as well as “hallux limitus” (in other words, limited mobility due to the reduced cartilage).

This was an absolute blow to me. I am going to see more specialists to try to get a solid plan of action, but something like this was completely unexpected. As of right now I am basically feeling as though my long term goals are shot, as my body simply won’t allow it. 

A part of me feels like I am overreacting, but movement is basically my whole life. Does anyone have any experience with this type of injury/ailment? I would love some first-hand info. Will I basically be limited the rest of my life?",1627138988

&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; **Background:** Recent studies in rodents indicate that a combination of exercise training and supplementation with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors has synergistic effects. However, there are currently no human clinical trials analyzing this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Objective:** This study investigates the effects of a combination of exercise training and supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the immediate precursor of NAD+, on cardiovascular fitness in healthy amateur runners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Methods:** A six-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm clinical trial including 48 young and middle-aged recreationally trained runners of the Guangzhou Pearl River running team was conducted. The participants were randomized into four groups: the low dosage group (300 mg/day NMN), the medium dosage group (600 mg/day NMN), the high dosage group (1200 mg/day NMN), and the control group (placebo). Each group consisted of ten male participants and two female participants. Each training session was 40-60 min, and the runners trained 5-6 times each week. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed at baseline and after the intervention, at 6 weeks, to assess the aerobic capacity of the runners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Analysis of covariance of the change from baseline over the 6 week treatment showed that the oxygen uptake (VO2), percentages of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), power at first ventilatory threshold, and power at second ventilatory threshold increased to a higher degree in the medium and high dosage groups compared with the control group. However, there was no difference in VO2max, O2-pulse, VO2  related to work rate, and peak power after the 6 week treatment from baseline in any of these groups.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusion:** NMN increases the aerobic capacity of humans during exercise training, and the improvement is likely the result of enhanced O2  utilization of the skeletal muscle.

Paid to get the test done at a local sports clinic. Seems my lactate levels spiked but then went down afterwards, is that normal?
https://imgur.com/ltsNUwN

Lactate gets up to 7.4 at heart rate of 162, which seems very low to me. For reference, I'm 27M, run my easy miles up to HRs of 153-155 and am conversational at that pace. The tester goes on to do 3 more intervals of 3 minutes with slight increases in speed, all of which show the lactate levels to be from 1.7-2.9 meaning they dropped back down from the initial spike. The way they explained it to me is that after I hit my threshold my body began to flush the lactate. Isn't Lactate Threshold by definition the point at which your blood begins to accumulate lactate at a faster rate than it can get rid of it? Please help me interpret this. Thanks.",1627076800

I did cross country and long/mid distance track in freshman year but wasn’t able to do these last year due to covid so I had to run on my own. Unfortunately I was extremely inconsistent and often went entire months without doing a run.

I’m starting to run again and I’m wondering how high my training volume should be. Most of my cardiovascular endurance is gone, but I’m assuming that since I consistently ran at some point that my muscles and tendons are still able to take on more load than someone who hasn’t run before.

As a side note, I’d also like to ask if it’ll be easier to regain my cardiovascular fitness than it was to initially gain it, or if it’ll take just as long with just as much training. 

Is it safe for me to increase my training volume faster than a beginner would up until it matches my old training volume? Or should it be increased at a similar pace due to how long my break from running has been?

Other information to note while answering: 

My previous peak MPW during cross country was roughly 25-36 miles per week. Unfortunately I don’t know the exact number.

627,AdvancedRunning,Humanoid-v1,"Does everyone hit a ""wall"" in a marathon?","In the two marathons I've ran, I've hit a wall by the 20-23 mile mark whereby either my legs feel significantly heavier (i.e. harder to maintain a regular stride length) or I have to slow down significantly to avoid cramping (e.g., from 7:10min/mile to over 9min/mile). To use physics jargon, there's an obvious ""phase transition"": one minute I'm feeling completely fine, then the next my legs are crashing. Physiologically, I guess this is due to glycogen depletion, like a gas tank going from non-empty to empty, which forces the body to switch to metabolizing fat, which is much less efficient. (I did take enough fluids and nutrition during the races: 5 clif gels, with water/electrolytes handed out along the course). However, looking at some of the race reports here, I often see people post marathon splits that are almost constant all the way up to the 26.2. So I'm wondering whether everyone will hit a wall in some form at their marathon pace and just have to learn to run through it with sheer mental fortitude, or whether one can avoid the wall completely with sufficient training?

To give some context, I ran both of these races with insufficient preparation: my training maxed out at 35mpw, I had injuries (stress reaction) that forced me to stop training almost entirely in the 5 weeks leading up to race day. Also, I was sleep deprived the week before one race due to caring for a family member at a hospital. Maybe it's all these circumstances that led to the wall, not that the wall is inevitable.

Somewhat related, it seems the issue doesn't appear in half marathons. In a recent HM where I also ran with barely any training (&lt; 10mpw), I could hold 6:35min/mile for the 13.1 and only felt limited by my lactate threshold and respiratory limits when I tried to speed up near the end. Whereas I can't even hold 7:10min/mile for 26.2.

630,AdvancedRunning,thaquestion,Hood to Coast Question(s),"We've got a team headed out at the end of August for HTC this year.  Looking at past results, we'd like to finish in the top 3 in our division and are pretty confident that is viable with current fitness.  We've won a few other relays in the past, but this is obviously a different animal.  


We've recently heard some different things from some runners that have competed on teams that have taken a more casual approach, and these things have caused a bit of concern, so I figured I would jump in here and ask some questions, as I'm sure there are some in here that have taken a more competitive approach to the race.  


The major question surrounds exchanges.  How bad are they, and are did you find yourselves in situations where you couldn't get to the next exchange in time?  If that situation did occur, we're you able to work around it?  I know that there is a rule about dropping runners off within 500ft of an exchange, but, let's say traffic was stopped a half-mile out, would it be wise to drop your runner off there and let them warm-up over that 800m?  Did you use vehicles over and above your vans to leap frog runners?  I've read the handbook, and I know there are a ton of rules around vans, so I'm not sure this is even legal, and I want to make sure we follow the rules explicitly.  


In your experience, does HTC start like other relay races with the fastest teams going off last (we've heard otherwise)?  Do things typically bunch up in the middle of the race as they do in other races? 

Were there any other situations that you would recommend we be aware of?

631,AdvancedRunning,ER24,Looking for advice on safely returning from a quad strain,"I strained my right quad on June 25th from overtraining. It was fairly mild, I was still able to walk, and didn't have any pain at all within two days or so. I took 12 days off while doing mild stretching, body weight squats, and light band work. After returning I did three short (2.5-3.5mile) slow runs on three consecutive days. I felt completely fine, took a rest day on the 4th day, then did 3.5 on the 5th day and 5 on the 6th day. After the 5 mile run, I did feel some discomfort (2/10) and decided to take 1 more week off. The week was up today and I did a very slow 2.5 mile run. Felt completely fine during the run, but I feel a bit of tension in my quad around 4 hours post-run if I plant my foot in a certain way. It isn't constant. 

It's now been 27 days since the initial injury. I was planning on doing 3 runs this week with rest days in between each, but I'm slightly off put by the fact that I do feel 'something' in my quad after today's run. Is there a point where discomfort is normal when starting to run again after injury, or should things essentially be 100%?

634,AdvancedRunning,Ethnadar,Looking for guidance injury prevention from intense workload -,"Transfer post from r/running (sorry I'm not the most skilled with Reddit)

Background: 18 y/o M running about 35-40 MPW usually around 7:30 pace, but goes closer to 6:30 pace on workout days. It has been this way the entire summer. My current training plan that I am on is a slow buildup into my season where I am expected to be around 16:40, but I want to be much quicker.

Alright so let me start things out with the goal, in about 3 months is the state qualifying/state cross country meet, and my goal is to win state, which for my class, is around 16 flat. Currently, my PR is a 17:30, which was enough for me to qualify as a sophomore, but due to an injury from over training my junior year, I failed to make it past districts. As you can imagine, this was one of the most humiliating moments of my life, as the district meet was held in my hometown, and all of my friends and family watched as the star runner of the town failed to make state in front of them.

I came out of that season with a burning sense of motivation, and I decided I was going to win state no matter what. Over the last few months I have visited extra coaches, with expensive training plans, but I still don't feel like it is enough. I've tried changing how I breathed (nose-only to limit air intake, therefore making my lungs more efficient) and even considered buying a weighted vest, just to get stronger. I have set up tape around my school's entire track at specific spots that at the right cadence, will set me up for around a 4 min mile pace (for speed work). However, with the little amount I feel I have done \~30 miles/week. I still can feel myself getting injured, I can feel that even now I have brought on some runners knee, even sitting down to type this is making my knees ache, even so, I know that this is the LEAST I will be training over the next few months - no matter the pain that I will go through, as long as it makes me believe I am getting stronger.

The main goal here is to get as fast as I can without getting injured, but I know my body is not able to handle the same load my mind can, and I know for certain that this season will go either 1 of 2 ways, I get injured, and it is a repeat of my failure last year, or I am state champion.

I'm willing to put in the work, I will do anything, but there is only so much my body can handle compared to my mind. I do practice good warm ups and cool downs, ice, and stretches. It makes me so frustrated that I don't think I can reach my goal over something so unfair as an injury. I've been eating much better and getting close to 120 g of protein a day, so I must know, is there ANYTHING that can help me to reach my goal and prevent me from destroying my knees? No matter how the season goes, I would rather train too hard and get hurt, than train too little, and not redeem myself.

Any help is great help. BE AS BRUTAL AS YOU WANT.

637,AdvancedRunning,the_el_tortuga,Where should I set my expectations for the fall?,"Here’s the deal: I have sort of an unusual story with the sport &amp; as a result I have no idea what expectations are realistic when a (generally) post-COVID world arrives and I start racing regularly this fall.  

I started running in early September of 2019 as a college sophomore (then a 19 y.o. male), training for a half marathon.  I managed 1 flat mile in 8:51, and I nearly passed out at the end.  At that point I hadn’t played a sport since JV boy’s volleyball, and my only conditioning was some occasional rock climbing/backpacking.  

Ran my first half solo in May 2020 &amp; barely managed a 2:15.  Trained all summer &amp; by the fall I was consistently putting in 30-45 mpw.   Lowered my half PR to 1:53 that December.   In spring 2021 I set my sights on the 5k but - despite consistent weekly milage between 30-50 w/ two workouts &amp; a long run each week, I couldn’t drop my 5k PR lower than a 22:27 (though it’s worth noting I never really got to taper for a race).  

This summer I’m running 6-7 days a week, on track to average 40-60 mpw, and I feel good despite working a job on my feet and an icky VA summer.  I’m doing 1 hard workout + a long run every week.  Easy pace somewhere between 8:30-9:30, based on the heat. 

This fall, I’ll get to run my first-ever (NIRCA) XC season.  I’ll be a 21 year old male with some solid milage under my belt, and I’d love to break 20 in the 5k.  Is this an attainable goal?  If not, what seems more reasonable?  I’m not afraid to work my ass off, I just have no real reference point for what to expect.

_________________

This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts.  

**This week is Squires Long Run**.

*History:*

This series of long run workouts was created by Bill Squires, legendary coach of the Greater Boston Track Club (of which Bill Rodgers was a member). These workouts were designed to simulate the latter stages of a marathon.

*What:*

Insert a number of surges right smack in the middle of your long runs. Squires suggests surging for anywhere from 30 seconds to 12 minutes—the shorter the surge, the faster the pace.

*How:*

Pretty simple. *Competitor* recommends inserting a bit of structure to the surges. Here's their example over a 10-week period (final Squires Long Run is 3 weeks out from the marathon):

* Week 1: 15:00 easy, 6 x [2:00 surge @ 5K effort/8:00 easy], 15:00 easy [90 minutes total]

* Week 3: 25:00 easy, 6 x [4:00 surge @ 10K effort/6:00 easy], 25:00 easy [1 hour, 50 minutes total]

* Week 5: 35:00 easy, 6 x [6:00 surge @ half marathon effort/4:00 easy], 35:00 easy [2 hours, 10 minutes total]

* Week 7: 45:00 easy, 6 x [8:00 surge @ marathon effort/2:00 easy], 45:00 easy [2 hours, 10 minutes total]

M, 27, 65-70MPW. 11 Weeks out from first Sub3 marathon attempt. Previous PBs 1:24 HM, 37.29 10k, 17:39 5k (Time trial not official).

Sunday long runs are picking up around the 16-22 mile mark over the next couple of weeks with blocks of marathon pace in them but what are your go-to mid week sessions. 

For example for the next 2 weeks my sessions are 8x1k at around 5k pace and week after is 5x1 mile trying to match pace. Reasoning behind prescribing these kind of sessions is to improve lactate threshold and get used to running harder than marathon pace. 

Should I be looking to increase the volume of these sessions over the next couple of weeks maybe more aimed at HM pace for example 4x2 miles, 4x3 miles etc or is it good to maintain the kind of intensity.

645,AdvancedRunning,knandraina,Training Marathon,"Hello team,

I hope you are doing well. I plan to run a marathon next year (it will be my first time). I've started to run at the beginning of the year. I have been mainly running small distances (5k). 

Since mid-April 2021, I decided to buy a watch, a Polar Vantage V2, to see how I improve myself. While it is not 100% accurate, it gives me a rough idea of where I am.

A few days ago, I did a test to calculate my max heart rate. It is at 188bpm. Then I applied my different heart zone.  
Zone 1: 119-132 ;  
Zone 2: 133-146;   
Zone 3: 146-159;  
Zone 4: 160-173;  
Zone 5 : &gt; 173

Then I started to do my training in the city I lived. It is pretty flat, and I ran in Zone 2 between 5.30min/km to 6.15min/km. I had a really high (between 61 to 65) Index Running. While I know I shouldn't follow it religiously I like to see how I evolve over the long term through it.

Then I moved out from my little city, and now I live in a city where there are uphills. Indeed, it is not possible to only run on a flat surface. While I like it, if I want to stay in zone 2, I need to walk. A lot. Yesterday I did a run,10k at 6.30min/km, with a lot of walking when there were big uphills.

Of course, my Index Running is far lower than what it used to be (53).

Here are my questions, is it still relevant to stay in zone 2? Should I adjust my zone 2? I know there are multiple modes to do training with polar:

* Running
* Trail Running

**Training (Or Lack Thereof)**

I recently have gotten back into running seriously in the past two or three months. After completing my first half marathon in April 2020, I have been dealing with some personal issues relating to various factors within my life. Ultimately, I started running “full-time” again around the middle of May 2021 after taking almost four months completely off. With that being said, I am slowly building up my mileage again but only averaging roughly 20 miles a week currently. I have ran two Spartan Races recently, one Sprint and one Super, which is a completely different topic. Overall, I truly feel that my overall fitness is surprisingly not only coming back relatively quickly, but even surpassing my previous levels both physically and mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Race**

This decision to try to run a sub twenty-minute 5K was extremely spontaneous as I thought about attempting this feat the evening prior to my birthday. As my Spartan Super was on July 10th, I still had a few battle scars from that event and only ran two and half miles on Tuesday since then as active recovery. I seriously had no plans or preparation in regards to this random event.

I have a superstition that requires me to have a bowl of honey nut cheerios the night before anything that will test my physical capabilities ever since I aced my AFROTC Physical Fitness Assessment. Before going to bed, I decided to calculate the average pace I would have to run at and determined I would aim for a 6:30 minute per mile pace for the three miles and hope to get the last tenth of a mile in under 30 seconds to just barely achieve a sub 20 and have my watch read 19.XX. I determined that I would complete this around a loop that contains my local municipal building which is shockingly half of a mile exactly. This meant that I would aim to complete each lap under 3:15 if I wanted to have a chance at this random and ambitious goal.

I woke up the following morning around 6:30 to stretch, roll out, and simply hype myself up. I had some watermelon around 7:30 as I strongly dislike eating or drinking anything in the morning but figured I should get some fuel in me. I headed to my selected course around 8:00 with my father who so kindly agreed to wake up early and come time me. Although I do use his ancient Garmin Forerunner 310XT, I wanted someone there to not only cheer me on, but mainly to keep track of the time in case something went wrong. Nonetheless, I was so thrilled that he came out as I am so thankful for all of the support he has provided, especially this past year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Race**

I completed a few dynamic stretches and walked/jogged a quarter mile at most. This is one thing I need to work on in the future as I rarely warm up for any activity that I do as I always run immediately in the morning. Anyways, once I felt ready enough, I stripped down into just my running socks, my well-worn pair of Hoka Clifton 6, and a new pair of silkies which I wore for the first time as I wanted to feel like a true runner again. I counted down with my father so that my watch and his stopwatch would be fairly accurate and off I went.

To say that I started off too fast would be a major understatement. I have not completed any speedwork in months, or ever, and I truly have never trained specifically for faster paces. I completed the first lap or half mile in 2:48.56. I was unaware of how fast I was running as I am trying to break a bad habit of constantly looking at my watch and pace. I felt great so I assumed I was running around my target pace despite never being able to truly recognize my pace.

When my watch buzzed after completing lap two, I glanced down at my watch to see that I just ran a sub 6-minute mile. Not to get too sidetracked as I am sure this post is already extremely long, I honestly cannot tell you if I have ever run a sub 6-minute mile, let alone the 5:50.1 that I just ran for the first mile of this 5K. Later that day, my father mentioned that after the first mile he was so worried that I was not going to even finish another lap as I went out way too fast.

At this point, I made a serious and conscious effort to try to slow down as the adrenaline definitely carried me through that first mile. I knew deep down that if I continued at this pace that I was going to crash hard. The next two laps went by extremely quick, but towards the end of the fourth lap and into the fifth, it became the mental game.

My body surprisingly felt fine besides my knee which was slightly sore from a major abrasion that I collected the previous weekend. My mind kept telling me that I had plenty of time left to spare so I can just slow down. I was luckily able to fight through these thoughts of stopping as I knew I would be extremely disappointed in myself if I did not give this birthday run my best effort. I knew that I slowed down slightly from my watch and my father yelling my lap times, but I felt confident that if I continued this pace, 19.XX might be doable. Breaking twenty was a goal that I have been trying to accomplish for a while prior to my year long hiatus from running.

After the fifth lap, I dug deep to continue my current pace while saving enough energy for that final stretch. As soon as I came around the bend and my watched vibrated to alert my third mile, I began to sprint towards my father who moved down towards my estimated finish line. Once I reached him, I looked down at my watch to check my distance and I purposely avoided looking at the time to not psych myself out. I still had about 0.05 of a mile to go and I practically closed my eyes and ran as hard as I could to try to secure my 19.XX time. I glazed back down at my watch about fifteen seconds later and stopped my watch once I made sure it read 3.10 miles. I was in disbelief and I thought for sure that I miscalculated the course or that my Garmin did not accurately track my run. My watch did not read my reach goal of 19.XX but something that I would not have dreamed of. Not only did I run sub twenty, I shaved over a minute off of my PR. Once my father convinced me that I did in fact run the proper distance, I was simple speechless. I was incredibly nervous when I decided the night before to attempt to break twenty minutes as I knew that I would be extremely disappointed when I did not break twenty minutes. To not only break twenty minutes, but to surpass my goal by an entire minute was extremely surreal to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-Race**

Feeling the best I have in quite some time, my cooldown consisted of pacing the last tenth of a mile numerous times as I called my brother and soaked in this overwhelmingly positive high moment. It was bittersweet as I was hoping to get 19.XX on my 19th birthday for the effect. In reality, it still has not set in yet as sub nineteen was unimaginable and I did not even consider a possibility of achieving this even within the next year. I went home with my father and grabbed a quick shower before celebrating the rest of my birthday. I went with my father and my brother and tried my first Playa Bowl as I have heard so much hype about them. I was not disappointed as it was also the perfect victory and recovery meal. The rest of the day I was on this incredible high feeling as the result still is extremely surreal which made my 19th birthday amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future Goals**

I have missed running so much over this past year that I want to get back into it while putting my mental health as a major priority. I need to focus on the sustainability aspects of running and learn to run slow and truly enjoy the privilege that is running. This proved that my break to focus on my mental health was extremely important and definitely worth it as my life has completely changed and I feel unconditionally better in all aspects of my life.

For specific goals, I plan on earning my Spartan Trifecta by completing a Spartan Beast in October which is a half marathon distance. I also want to improve my 1.5-mile time for AFROTC by being able to comfortably max out the run time which is 9:12 or below. After the fall, I plan on focusing on longer distances either with a sub 1:30 half or my first marathon.

Ultimately, I will continue to build up my mileage while finalizing a few of my remaining personal issues and focus on my mental health as I have missed running greatly. I am hopeful that I will be able to reach any goal I create for myself with this new mindset as I never imagined I would have been this mentally and physically “healthy” and I am finally truly proud of myself!

**Upcoming race:** my first (virtual) marathon in late August

**Previous experience:** none, excluding an athletic background of competitive swimming and powerlifting

**Notes:** I started running in March 2020 and ran for the summer months. I began to experience IT band syndrome in June and the pain became very limiting in August of that year. I reached a peak of 40-50 km/week and accomplished a 2:08 half marathon but with severe pain. I went back to powerlifting and began running again in April 2021 and had a goal of racing in my city's marathon while completing my training injury-free. My ultimate goal is to run a BQ and race in marathons internationally.

My current peak and times are:

* \~105 km/week
   * the longest run of 32 km
* 10k: 49:51
* 21.1k: 1:47:38

The listed times were run at about 75% effort. My usual training pace is 5:10/km, and I am continuing with my lifting but at a decreased load (5x/week).

I haven't read any books by Daniels or Pfitz but I knew enough from browsing and combined with my swimming experience to slowly ride the peak up and increase my long runs marginally every week. I am also familiar that not every run must be a PB, and that the majority of runs are at a comfortable, steady pace.

**Question:** Where and how would you see me improving? Is my mileage too high for my experience? I haven't had any injuries since I've started again this year and I've improved my recovery with a better warmup/cooldown, and stretching and foam rolling. Thoughts on how I may perform in the marathon? Cheers",1626729295

I’m going to take a crack at a 1500 in a little under two weeks and honestly have no idea what to expect or aim for given I have never run one. I am guessing I will be running alone but that could change depending on who enters in the next 12 days which makes pacing all the more important.

I am curious what kind of training led you folks to the times in the title. I am training for the 5k at the moment so haven’t done any real mile specific sessions to post but was on the track doing some faster stuff the last few weeks and wanted to compare as much as possible to what other people have done to get a reasonable picture of fitness.

Some general info:
* Last 8 weeks averaged 62 miles/week on 7 days of singles
* 15:23 5k PR from last cycle. Other PRs are worse and for longer distances.
* Easy miles 7:10-7:30. 
* 36 years old. Definitely more of a speedster.
* 12-14 x 100m once a week in 12 high-14 mid w/ jog in.

Last 5 sessions:
* 10 @ easy tempo avg. 5:48 (7/4)
* 12x400 @  goal 5k w/ 200 jog avg. 71.4 (7/7)
* 8 @ aerobic tempo avg 5:38 (7/11)
* 3x1000m/200m w/ 200 jog between the 1000 &amp; 200 and 4’ between sets. Then a 600/200 w/ 200 jog between. 2:55/31,2:54/31,2:57/32,1:42/29 (7/14)

659,AdvancedRunning,Hooch_Pandersnatch,Questions about Strength training,"My upcoming goal marathon is at the end of August, after which I’m planning to take a relative down period to help reset me physically and mentally.

During this time I’d like to implement some more strength work to help with injury mitigation and hopefully build up some more fast twitch muscle fibers in the legs too. I’d still like to run during this time, but more focused on shorter distance rather than marathoning (I’ve been averaging 70 MPW with plenty of tempo and threshold level efforts during this current training block; during the down time, I’d like to dial it back to maybe 30-35 MPW focusing more on 5k specific workouts).

Some questions:
1) I was looking at strength programs. I see Stronglifts 5x5 recommended a lot (both on this forum and others) but are there better lifting programs mor specialized towards runners? e.g. I’m not sure how stuff like the bench press or overhead press will really relate to running (given my limited lifting knowledge)

2) Is it realistic to do both a strength training program (maybe 4x weekly) along with 2-3 5k specific workouts each week? 5k workouts being things like 800m repeats. Because I’m planning to cut back mileage drastically, I was hoping to somewhat mitigate the lack of total miles with more intense efforts. But I’m not sure if the added lifting will be too much for me to also handle 2-3 track workouts each week in parallel.",1626701053

Before anyone says it, Yes. I’m aware of the rules of this subreddit and no I’m not looking for a medical diagnosis. I have already seen both physical therapy and a doctor to receive both an examination and MRI, both of which haven’t been helpful. The MRI came back with nothing and my doctor (Orthopedic) said he doesn’t know what’s wrong either…

Hence, I wanted to reach out here to ask if anyone had experienced this similar issue and give some tips and tricks into things they did or people they went to see for help.

As for the specifics, I have reoccurring pain beneath or “behind” the knee. It’s not sharp pain but it’s uncomfortable enough that it can prevent me from running. The inside facing side of my knee is sensitive to press on, yet the bottom doesn’t hurt to touch (where the pain comes from). It almost feels like a tight tendon is pulling on my knee. Curling my leg back, all the way, feels strange as well as extending my entire leg. Going into a hamstring stretch is nearly impossible on the effected leg. The real pain and or discomfort comes from pushing off the ground and walking up/down stairs.

This suddenly comes and goes during my training but this time it’s quite bad preventing me from running all together. There’s no warning signs as it just appears after any given run. Yesterday I did an easy 9mi and now I can’t run on it at all…

671,AdvancedRunning,ejsfsc07,My achilles story/rant,"Hi, I'm currently doing summer training for college cross country, and it has been going well for the most part, aside from stupid achilles injuries. Up until this point, I had been basically injury free. 

In February 2021, I did damage to my left achilles. It killed whenever I wore a shoe with a closed back. I couldn't run for a month and got Hoka One One's because they were the ones that didn't hurt my heel. I'm fairly certain this was insertional achilles tendonitis. Anyways, I was luckily able to run basically pain free in April, but my left heel never fully healed. 

In June the pain started to come back in my left heel, but no where's near as bad. In fact, it was more like stiffness, and I felt it in my calf too. I still kept running but started stretching more and it helped. 

I had a thought like: *What would happen if my right heel started hurting too?*

A week later, I was doing yard work and then I shortly noticed on my run that my right heel was popping. Then when I pressed down on my right achilles with my thumb, like right on the tendon, there was pain. Yet, when I did this on my left achilles, there was no pain, yet my left heel still hurt, just in a different way.

Some runs it never flares up. Whenever my left is stiff/hurts, my right isn't/doesn't and vice versa. 

I'm still running just because the pain never exceeds a 1.5/10 and I have to get the mileage in. But I'm now worried about my right heel because on my long run my right calf started twinging. In some ways, my right heel injury feels more like a typical achilles injury. I have no clue what the heck I did to my left heel, maybe it's a bone spur.

Anyways, I'm super frustrated and currently icing my right heel as I write this. I often wonder if I will ever run pain free again.",1626530925

To give background, I’ve used the runners world “Break 3hr” training plan and it’s worked nicely my first 2 marathons (2:55 PR). While the plan is great, I wanted to challenge myself/change plans to try and hit sub 2:50. Being that I was one of the unfortunate 9k+ people that got denied from Boston after qualifying this year, I thought I shouldn’t leave anything up for debate my next race and use their specific plan. I started with the level 4 plan but it quite honestly kicked my ass to the point where I felt that I should back down a bit and move to level 3 with a bit less MPW. I’m currently 9 weeks into the plan and still find it crushing me week over week, particularly the Fartlek runs and Sunday tempo runs. Goes without saying that all training plans aren’t easy but this one feels particularly tough. I tend to struggle to hold the paces the plan suggest to run based on my expected finishing times. I feel as though if I pushed myself to get those times, I’d overtrain and get hurt.

My current situation is the following.
I can train 3 times a week for 45 min max.

Tonight I was doing a ladder workout (nothing too fast) and for the majority had no issues with them (even as they ran in lane one or walked in front of me/weren’t paying attention even the “coaches”. I put coaches in parentheses because I have to say the activities I see them doing are questionable but it’s good seeing young kids getting involved.

Anyways- towards the end of my workout they start doing activities and push-ups near the start line. This is a small 4 lane track and the football field has a barrier set up so people don’t walk on it. The group had plenty of room to spread out but instead chose to take up all 4 lanes. The first 3 times I passed them I was on recovery laps and went into the grass. Due to the football field barrier it’s barely a foot wide and very uneven. 

SO, since they didn’t seem like they were moving over I decided to weave through them (not going fast). The coach and a parent immediately starts yelling at me telling me to get off the track for being dangerous. No warning whatsoever. I said well lane one should really be open. They responded well we pay to use the track and we can use it however we want. I just said well it should still be open and said it’s great seeing you guys out here and took off.

682,AdvancedRunning,scatterbrained_mugen,Major Regression in Performance Coming Off a ~4 Month Break - Mental Issue or Potential Health Concern?,"Let me preface that it's been about 5 months since I ended a 4-month break from running, and I've been running on a somewhat regular basis (3-4 times / week; &lt;= 5 miles / run). The post is regarding a concern that I'm now no where near performance-wise where I was before even starting my marathon training plan about a year ago.

Back in September 2020 I started the Pfitz 18/55 plan to train for a solo marathon. When starting training I had recently hit PRs with a 1:29:13 half and 18:58 5k, and I had been running regularly for about a year prior.

About 8 weeks into the program I had an IT band injury that I tried to fight through (stupidly). I aggravated it to the point where I had to ditch the program and plans on running the marathon. Roughly from November to January I stopped running completely. I bought a rowing machine and did that roughly 3-4 times a week, since that didn't aggravate my IT band.

By January I was healed up and ready to run again injury-free, though I continued to avoid running because of a combination of the shitty cold weather and a health concern. Essentially, I suddenly started experiencing paresthesia in different areas of my body at random points in the day. I tried eliminating different things from my daily routine to see if it would help resolve the issue. Eventually, I went to a neurologist and got tested for a bunch of things, and fortunately everything came back clean. However, since then it's still gone undiagnosed and I continue to experience it (often at the beginning of runs but it goes away after running for \~5-10 minutes). It's worth noting that the sensation is mild enough that I could definitely run through it, but it definitely is uncomfortable.

Around March I started running again regularly. However, since then it's been like 5 months of running regularly and both my pace and endurance feel like they've taken a huge hit. Nowadays I'm looking at 4-5 mile runs at a 7:55 pace and feeling gassed at the end of it. For context my medium-long runs back when I was training used to be at that pace and I felt fine at the end of those.

I wouldn't be as concerned if I was *just* starting up back again, but it's been 5 months now and I'm seeing no progress. The ""best"" run I've had since  was once when I ran an 8 mile run at a 7:15 pace, but I'm having a lot of difficulty getting anywhere near close to that level.

Is this likely just a mental block (have you or someone you know experienced a drop off like this before)? If so, how do I get over it?

Or should I at least expect to have seen some improvement over the past 5 months, and maybe I need to see if something else healthwise is going on?

683,AdvancedRunning,a_retired_lady,Running / training for sub 3-hour marathon in ketosis.,"I eat keto (technically modified Atkins diet, &lt;20g net carbs / day) for epilepsy. My marathon PR is 2:58, but I used to eat carbs then. Last week I completed my first 50 miler and got the itch to try and PR my marathon. Goal 2:55. 

I'm curious if anyone has experience running a marathon while in ketosis. Do you eat / fuel during the race? (I didn't really eat anything during my 50 miler last week.) What is the fuel of choice? Any tips or advice?",1626385143

My iron levels are 10 ng/ml, which is incredibly low. My question is, how long can I expect to be able to see improvement from this?

685,AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Higher HR when social running?,"Curious if anyone else has noticed this. I've noticed a pretty consistent trend where my HR will register 10-15bpm higher while running with friends. Just for example, on Thursdays I'll run 3 miles to a run, do a 3 mile social run, then run a mile back to my car. During the social run my HR spikes by 10-15bpm, even with a relatively slower pace.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm wondering if its mental, or maybe due to some extra aerobic effort from talking. Sometimes its not a big deal, but if I'm doing a pace where my HR would normally be 155 and it spikes to 170 its a bit frustrating, and I question if the effort is even ""easy"" anymore",1626379892
686,AdvancedRunning,RektorRicks,Anyone else have a pretty slow easy pace?,"I've been attending some more running groups recently, and I'm genuinely surprised how fast some folks easy paces are with relatively slow race times. Just for example, I've talked to several woman who do most of their easy running in the 8s but have 5k/10k PRs around 21/45. I was also chatting with a guy who's easy runs seems to be in the very low 8s/high 7s but has a marathon PR of 3:20. Just going off Strava HR data (obviously potentially flawed), it does look like these are realistic easy paces for these people, with HRs in the 130/140/low 150s. To clarify, these are awesome race times but these runners also have great easy paces. A 45 minute 10k means 6.2 7:15 miles which is like a 1:15 min/mile off of their easy paces. 

Personally I do most of my easy runs in the mid/high 9s, anything in the 8s generally spikes my HR. However I can very comfortably do a 5:30 mile, sub 20 in the 5k and if I raced a 10k I imagine my target time would be somewhere around 42 or lower. I'm a relatively young guy (27) but I'm pretty surprised at the relative closeness between these easy paces and race paces. 

Am I abnormal here? Or do these runners just have a ton of untapped speed potential? Its kind of crazy to be giving advice to someone outrunning me on an easy run, but it really does feel like they're underperforming relative to their easy baseline. I do follow training plans so I think my speed is pretty well developed.",1626374692

688,AdvancedRunning,alyruns,"Training advice: tips to improve tempo runs? I feel very comfortable on long runs with MP work, and kind of out of sorts in my threshold paces","I just started week 2 of the pfitz marathon plan (18/55) and the biggest difference between this plan and how I trained for my last marathon is all the LT work. The first workout was 8 miles total with 4 at LT and I decided to break it up into 2 and 2 with a few min recovery in between because the humidity was crazy. By the end of the last mile I was definitely on the struggle bus. I averaged 8:08min/mile for the 4 mile. The thing that kind of threw me off is I recently did a long run workout (not as part of the training plan) that had 3 miles at MP towards the end of a 13 miler and I averaged 8:00 without really trying so I know I can hit those paces (I think I had really good weather on that run which probably helped a lot)

Anyway my actual question is, what’s the best way to improve tempo runs? Repeats on the higher end of the pace range? Trying to go straight through on the lower end of the range?",1626371291

691,AdvancedRunning,jww849,On track to BQ?,"Looking for some advice on my training and if those who have BQ'd think i'm on track to do it this fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backround:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19M, basically never ran in my life till 2.5 years ago. Stupidly signed up for a marathon 2 years ago on basically zero training and fell in love with the sport. Ran 4:06. Latley I have ramped up my training in a big way, I basically just ran my first 40 mile week in early this year, and now i'm putting on 70 mile weeks with no injuries or problems at all. My training consists of one long run, one medium long run about 5 miles shorter than my LR, one tempo (2 ish mile warm up, 6-8 tempo around 6:20 ish per mile, 2 mile cool down), one easy day and the other days about 10 miles per day. One day off every 10 days or so. All this volume has definitely helped my performance, I just PR'd the 5k last weekend at 17:09. Although i'm definetly getting more fit, I have my doubts to if I have what it takes to go 2:55 ish this fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Training Questions:

1. I'm basiclly doing 0 workouts right now. Should I add them in? if so how often and what types of workouts.

2. Keep increasing volume as long as I don't get hurt? I've gone from 40 mpw to 70 mpw in like the last 2 months. Don't want to increase too fast but I think I could peak around 80-85 ish by late summer/early fall before the taper

3. Any other tips to optomize training?

693,AdvancedRunning,ScottS93,2 Workouts vs 3 Workouts per week,"Hi, long time lurker here.

Just a general question I'd be interested to get your insight on this training philosophy.

Currently 6 weeks into a 18 week marathon block aiming for a sub-3 marathon.

I am currently running 100-105km per week (with a peak week of 130km planned) making significant improvements in terms of workout performance. Last week was a Tuesday 3x2km at LT w/ 1k float, Thursday 4x5 mins at 5k pace followed by 5x2 mins at 3k pace with 2 min walk recovery and a 26k long run with 2x5km at marathon pace on sunday. Rest of the week is all easy/recovery running.

My up build weeks are looking fairly similar in terms of a threshold workout tuesdays, faster speed thurdays and long run w/ blocks of marathon pace sunday. Has anyone used anything similar to this as I see alot of plans only doing 1 workout per week plus a long run (occasionally with MP efforts in e.g. Pfitz). I've planned a recovery week with all easy and strides every 4 weeks as well.

I do quite a bit of S&amp;C to keep niggles and injuries at bay, yes alot of my easy runs are sluggish because I am recovering from workouts - is this training style (2 mid week workouts plus quality long run) an injury waiting to happen.

Thanks a lot for any responses in advance.",1626358938
694,AdvancedRunning,movingmeditation,My legs feel hollow,"A quick snap shot: Ran a 28km trail race last Saturday (2300 ft up / 3000ft down). Did well enough 3rd OA and 2nd female. On Sunday I swam and did an easy bike ride. Monday swim only. I’ve got back to running since Tuesday. I just finished a run this morning and my legs feel like total trash. Hollow. They have all week. It’s like I’m not recovering at all. I’m sleeping and hydrating and doing all the things - but I feel weak. I’m at a loss here bc I’m usually plenty recovered by now.

The only random factor that may impact this is that I was bit by a wasp/hornet during the race. I’m deff having a reaction (swelling, redness, itching) but I really don’t think that’s related.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome. I want my legs back!",1626351218
695,AdvancedRunning,buddhahat,Did I do the right thing?,"Bailed out of my run this morning.  I've had 2 hard runs this week plus my 15km easy run yesterday (Wednesday, Singapore time) turned into running the final 5km or so at HM pace because I was feeling really good.  Quads and calves have been sore the last day or so from the repeats on Monday and the threshold run on Tuesday.    I run between 75 and 80km a week with one day off (Sunday).   


I was wondering whether I should take a day off today (12km easy was on the schedule) but kitted up anyway.  Legs felt weak from the get go but that happens sometimes when I'm just getting started (I'm 55).  But I kept feeling off and then my left calf started tightening up so I just thought all the signs were saying stop.  So I did.  Only about 300 meters into the run.  Lol. 

Did I stop too soon?  Should I have run it out a little further to see if I warmed up properly?  I think this is only the 2nd run I've bailed on in 2 years.

697,AdvancedRunning,rbickfor1988,Changing foot strike,"I’m wondering how to go about changing my foot strike pattern. Probably 8-9 years ago, I had a cut across the bottom of my foot, and in the 3 weeks it took to heal, I pretty much completely changed my running form. 

I land on the outsides of both feet (though it’s more exaggerated on the right foot— where the actual injury was) and then “roll” in. 

I have done a couple marathons, but generally a condensed 10-12 week training plan has been sufficient. This time I’m trying to give myself a full 20 weeks ahead of Boston, but the miles increase seems to be hitting me harder than in the past. 

I’m 33F, and I am maybe 5lbs heavier than normal (still working on kid 4’s baby weight), but I’m wondering if the extended training might be exacerbating issues from my foot strike. Currently at 30-35 mpw, up from usually 25; and this will only continue to rise as I get further into training. 

I realize age and KS summers could also be culprits for making my legs feel like they just can’t recover at all, but I also don’t think changing this would hurt in the long run, and the amount of miles I’m doing now might be an ideal time to do this. 

I can add a pic of my wear pattern, if that would help clarify what the heck I’m talking about. Thanks!",1626287919

699,AdvancedRunning,WhiteHawk1022,Feedback on my plan for a spring 2022 BQ attempt,"Hey r/AdvancedRunning, looking for some feedback on my plan for a BQ attempt (sub-3) at a spring marathon. I'm tentatively planning on the Vermont City Marathon in May 2022. Background info:

* Age: 33
* Sex: Male
* Current MPW + pace: 30 mpw; aerobic pace: 8:00-8:30/mile
* Previous peak MPW: 61 mpw is my highest ever (fall 2019)
* Previous PRs:
   * Mile: 5:24 (2019)
   * 5k: 18:26 (2016)
   * Half marathon: 1:23:47 (2019)
   * Marathon: 3:43:39 (2014 - my only marathon to date. I've attempted to get to the marathon several more times but been sidelined by injuries.)

I got injured at the end of 2019 and cut back on running for most of 2020 to focus on strength training. I still kept up with running, but only recently started building volume again.  I just completed Pfitzinger's 30 miles per week base training plan, and I'm about to start his 12-week half marathon plan, which starts at 31 miles per week and peaks at 47 miles. My target race is in mid-October.

After the half, I plan to take a couple of weeks off, then pursue one of these options:

1. Maintain mileage throughout the winter (potentially race here and there), so I can start Pfitz's 18/55 plan after the new year. 
2. Get back to base training with Pfitz's 60 miles per week plan to prep for his 18/70 marathon plan. 

Open to any thoughts or suggestions regarding these two paths. The most I've ever run in a single week is 61 miles, so the second option (prepping for the 18/70 plan) would be new territory for me. Do you think the build from where I am now to where I would want to be by next spring is too much?",1626271632

To give you some background, I originally used Nike Lunarglides as my general training shoe, but a few years ago they got discontinued and ""replaced"" with the Epic and Odyssey Reacts. I chose the Odysseys and found them really similar to the older pre-version 8 Lunarglides, and so as able to transition without any problems.

However, Nike do not appear to have an obvious replacement for the Odysseys and I'm struggling to find a suitable shoe to transition to. I tried the React Milers but found them a bit ""clumpy"" and they rubbed the balls of my feet something terrible after about 5km on every run.

    I've never been much of a long-distance guy. I've always said anything over 1600m on a track is sacrilege. 400m through the mile is my bread and butter, but I'm tired of not having a competent 5K time to carry around. I decided that would change this summer.
    I don't do well with high mileage, I break down fairly easily, so I only averaged 35mpw before my taper. Two workouts per week (interval builder workout, tempo run, speed repeats, and hill repeats). One long run per week, usually around 80 minutes.

    ### Race
    I was originally planning on running a road race, but I've been training primarily in the evening, so I figured running around 8:30 on a track would be my best bet.
    Two buddies from high school ran with me through the first two miles. One of them did all the work for the first mile, and it went by like a breeze. He was pacing perfectly, calling out splits every 200m - the first mile was effortless. As the second mile wore on, I had to start pushing the pace a few times as I could tell he was starting to slip. They dropped off at the two-mile mark and I was all on my own for the last mile. This is where I really benefited from running on a track. My mind started to get a bit foggy, but I could focus on hitting pace for each 400m, and once I got down to the last 800m I knew I had a good time coming.

I am looking to begin training for a marathon I am running against my roommate in one month’s time. I know this is nowhere close to ideal but we have money on the line, as well as pride. What is the safest possible way to go about training for this?

I was imagining something like 10-15 miles this week, 15-20 week 2. 20-25 week 3, with one or two easy runs on the fourth week. I understand the risk for injury with such little training but I am doing this with hopes of minimizing risk. 

Would cross-training the majority of my mileage help? I have the muscular strength (i think) it is mainly the cardio i am lacking, how can i build this up as quickly as possible? Swimming and Biking are both on the table.

any advice is greatly appreciated, other than “don’t do it”. i ran a half before without training so i somewhat understand the toll it takes on your body. 

If it helps my roommate is in ~5 hr marathon shape. Tips on pacing are also appreciated. I would like to be around 4:15 to 4:45 realistically.",1626234721

I have run solidly for 1.5 years and during that time made a variety of clothing/shoe/gear upgrades, guided by (in significant part) by help advice posted to this sub.

I realize that for every run whether easy, speed, long, or race I always wear the same combination of ""lower body"" clothing. My kit consists of:

* compression shorts/leggings (Under Armour ColdGear leggings in the winter, Under Amour HeatGear/RUSH shorts or 3/4 leggings in the non-winter)
* 9 inch inseam Under Armour Tech shorts over top
* no garments under the compression layer

I realize there are a whole host of other shorts options out there, but I am unable to find good written advice comparing and contrasting shorts based on qualities such as:

* inseam length
* liner/no-liner
* material
* brand

How have you evaluated different shorts options for your kit? Do you feel that certain shorts are better for certain conditions (i.e workout vs race, heat)? How did you go about learning what you now like, or is it best to simply buy a bunch of different pairs and see what shakes out?",1626212017

**Training**

I got back into training during COVID and have been inching closer to my college PRs from 10 years ago. I had been piecing together my own training, but decided to follow a plan this time because I was getting tired of brainstorming workouts every week. I decided to use the Hanson's 5k 13-week plan to try and get that elusive 14:59.

Training didn't really go well. The workouts were kicking my butt from the get go and I was feeling pretty beat up after the first few weeks. I eventually realized I had received my COVID vaccine the 1st week of the plan and even though I didn't have any major side effects, there must have been some residual fatigue from it. Once I was feeling better my knee flared up and I had to take 2 weeks off while the swelling went away.

For some more self-inflicted training woes, my partner and I decided to move to Denver and planned on leaving around the 10 week mark of the plan. I decided to abbreviate the plan and push the goal race to week 9 right before we moved.

Since the gods were smiling down on me, the PNW was hit with a heatwave and the only day we could get a moving pod was the day before the race. I ended up not running for the 5 days leading up to the race and tired/sore/stressed from the move \*shrug\*.

Anyways that's my sob story. Throughout training I kept adjusting my goal and eventually settled on just running faster than I did a few months ago (15:35). Progress is progress.

**Pre-race**

I actually raced in a full mile (4:31) 3 weeks before. It was my first track race in 10 years! It was an improvement over my 1600 last winter (4:36) but I didn't engage well during the race and was too worried about going out too fast, hitting paces, afraid of hurting, etc. My goal for this race was to worry less about the clock and engage with the runners around me.

The race was at 9 PM so I had a big lunch and let that sustain me for the day. Warmed up 3 mi, did some strides, toed the line, and hoped for the best.

**Race**

Gun went off and the front went out fast. Top guys were probably shooting for 14:45ish so I hung back and sat at the back of that pack. Went through 400 in 73 and by that point I was in a pack of 3 or 4. The pace started to slow so I went to the front with the lead pack about 40-50m ahead. 1st mile was 4:54.

2nd mile I focused on racing and trying to catch guys who were falling off of the lead pack. I was still in the front of my group with a guy hanging on my shoulder the entire time. I kept thinking ""This guy is just going to let me do all the work and drop me with a few laps left, isn't he?"". We kept pushing and catching guys. Didn't catch the 2 mi split, but by my math it was about 4:57.

3rd mile the legs started to feel a little stale and just not sharp at all, but we kept hitting fairly even splits. With 800 to go the buy behind me made his move and surged past me. With 350 left I put started my kick, but didn't quite have enough in the final 200 to catch him at the line (came through 3 mi in 14:50). Results have me .12s behind him, 6th overall.

15:22 and although not as fast as I wanted to be, still making progress from 3 months ago.

**Post-race**

Pleasantly surprised with the result. I'm bummed the past week of training didn't go well, because I think I would have had a shot at a PR. I thought I raced well and am glad I pushed myself to run because I almost decided to skip it altogether.

I've been wanting to run an HM this fall so I've been looking at Chicago. I will try to squeeze in a quick HM training cycle before then and follow that up with a 5k before the winter. Hoping the HM strength will finally get me to sub 15.

* **Sex** F
* **Current MPW**: 38-45 (6wk trailing average 39mpw) 
* **Previous peak MPW**: 50 (high school so 🤷‍♀️)

I'm a hobbyjogger that vastly prefers shorter distances. After an injury/COVID-induced break, I've been training regularly since February to get back in shape, beat my 5000m PR from a 2019 time trial (18:53), and get fast enough to participate in the competitive portion of a local post-collegiate XC league. An incorrigible workout hero, the lack of group runs during the pandemic gave me the opportunity to really focus on a slow build of mileage and this is the longest I've been injury free since middle school with the highest sustained mileage. 

I think I'm aerobically underdeveloped -- about 4,000 lifetime miles based on Strava+old HS training logs -- and have suffered at the end of races for it, so I have been focusing my training on longer tempo runs with relatively little faster work compared to my past peak fitness. 

However…the lack of injury and seemingly every person I run with starting their training for Boston/Chicago has me considering trying out the marathon distance with a late autumn race. 

It would let me continue running with some good folks, get me accustomed to higher weekly mileage and prep for a killer 5K training block next summer/fall, and given my 5000m PR was run off relatively low mileage with too much quality work, probably not hurt my chances of achieving my goals for XC in 2022 too much.

1. Would it be insane to try and munge together the Pfitz 18/55 and 18/70 plans into something like an 18/60 and shoot for a late Oct/early November race with a goal of 3:20 or so? 

2. Is this counter-productive if I know I enjoy 5/8K more than longer races? Am I likely better served with several cycles of HM and base building if I plan to flex from 5K up to HM for most future races?

3. The answer for someone at my level probably is just ""run more, don't stress the details"", yea?

712,AdvancedRunning,LAANGRetention,Thoughts on pacing for 2 mile race in summer heat and humidity,"Just wondering what everyone thinks, I have  two mile race this Saturday at 7 p.m., and it'll likely be mid 80s with like 75-90 percent humidity (New Orleans baby!).  I ran my 5k PR back in the fall with a 20:18 (6:33/mi), and my 10k PR in February with a 43:51 (I expected a better time but my legs were oddly tired from the start).  

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking I'd shoot for like a 6:30, but with the weather...I'm just not sure.  I know it's short, so I will just be really heating up when I finish, but its also really hot.  On the other hand if I go out at like 7:00/mi, I'm worried I won't finish as quickly as I could.

Just curious, really, because if it were a 5k I'd just adjust down a little, but the odd shorter distance has me unsure.  I've been running regularly these days between 4-8 milers at like 7:30 pace and its tough but not killing me.  Anyway, thanks for your thoughts.",1626194602

I have taken the past 5 years off of marathon/half marathon running (during which I only ran 5-10 mpw) due to business/personal responsibilities, but am now getting back to higher mileage. Until 5 years ago I was a fairly avid runner and was able to pull of a 7:19 pace on a half marathon which was a huge accomplishment for me. I have been able to get back up to 30-40 mpw over the past couple of months now without much issue except I have found that I am running VERY slowly (11 mil miles, sometimes 12) and attempting even a 10 min or lower pace is difficult compared to what it used to be 5 years ago. I am in sweltering hot/humid Georgia, so I know the heat plays into it and I am now 50 years old.

715,AdvancedRunning,thief1434,"Returning to running after time off making lifting gains (using periodization) while staying consistent with runs and continually improving, thoughts and questions","Howdy there everyone. While I've accepted I will never be the guy to run 17min 5ks, I can usually get between 18-20min pretty consistently, usually in the 19's, and I'm pretty happy, but know if I leaned fully into running I could probably do faster, but I want to be a diversified athlete despite my love for running and that being my initial fitness background (funnily enough my running is better having added other stuff since I did xc and track in high school).

I've always been into running and calisthenics and can rip a bunch of pull ups off no problem, but recently I've gotten more into lifting and was experimenting with periodization. At first I was just doing a weird strength program but as I learned more and talked with a friend who has a degree in strength and nutrition and works as personal trainer I went more into periodization. 

**What I've been reading:**

* I initially started with *The Tactical Barbell 1 and 2*, but part of my issue is that his blocks only include strength which is only one small part strength endurance training. I think incorporating book 2, his endurance manual, is more useful, but it's still not a full answer
* 
The National Strength and Conditioning Association's publishings on block programming and training which I think is a more realistic approach to both running and lifting


**My issue:**

During this strength training block which I planned poorly, I initially couldn't run much because the strength training was too intensive to run a lot, but i still did low aerobic and some sprints/track endurance work, but switched to blocks as I learned more. However, I pretty much stopped running for ~1.5 months during this time, and recently started back up running and have found my cardio fitness has *significantly* declined with my 5k time being poor relatively, and my endurance, speed, etc also having fallen. It is honestly super discouraging to do a run I could easily do prior and struggle with it, but I know this can be easily fixed with a slow ramp up back to where I was, though the issue is not starting out too strong to my own detriment.


**My question:**

To those of you who have had a similar break from running, and those who have a need/desire/etc, to do strength and endurance training, how do you balance it out? A lot of what I read is to do 2-4 week blocks of each type of training, but I can't really envision myself taking that much time off from running and maintaining a good cardio base. I think it's doable, but I'm not knowledgeable on doing it.

**What I want:**

I want to be a tactical athlete. What this means is while i have some interest in hypertrophy and looking 'bigger', I want to be strong and able to lift weight and move weight without getting tired, but I also want to be able to be fast. Deadlifting 400lbs is awesome, but if I can't run 3mi in at least under 20-21 min then that strength is a bit pointless.

**Conclusion:**

Finding a good balance in overall fitness is difficult and something that's attainable, but requires knowledge. 

Apologies if I'm stepping too much into strength training for this sub, but I'd greatly appreciate some guidance or material to help myself figure out how to find this balance. Cheers and thanks!",1626187196

**Background/Training**

I'm a washed up D1 middle-distance specialist who graduated college in 2018 with what I would soon discover was a back stressie (turns out being in pain any time you're not curled up in the fetal position for three months is not a soft tissue issue from bad form no matter what your ATs say!). Stopped running for about 5 months after graduation due to a combo of the stress fracture and the shocking freedom of not ""needing"" to run for the first time in 4 years. And then I never really got back into training again. I'd go on casual watch-less runs around the neighborhood for fun, did some summer trail running, and did a lot of outdoorsy things like hiking and cross country skiing because I live in Montana and it's basically a crime if you're not outside, but I never had any sort of ""training regimen"". Heck I couldn't tell you my mpw or even my average pace per mile if you'd held a gun to my head. 

Then I met some friends-of-a-friend who were doing this race and I figured it'd be fun so I signed up. I'm probably pretty arrogant from the ""former D1 runner"" thing so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to build up to. Then I googled the race. Average elevation is 9,000 feet and it peaks at 9,600 feet. Lots of climbing (full marathon has 4,600 feet, not sure about the half). So about two months from the race I figured I should probably get a little serious. I started running (almost) every day and pushing up my distances on the weekends by doing longer trail runs. I live in the rural Rockies so my running options are ""running from one end of town to the other on mostly flat roads"" or ""10 mile 3,000 foot climb up the side of a mountain"". Due to time constraints I did the town running before or after work and on the weekends would go run up and down the sides of mountains. I figured that would average out to the kind of terrain the race is on which is forest service roads with rolling hills. 

Due to my (pretty lax) training and the fact that my last race was an 800m in 2018 I decided to make my goals pretty chill. (1) I wanted to finish feeling pretty good. I hadn't run 13 miles in one go in over three years so I figured even working up to that distance would be pretty good. (2) Checking the results showed me that it was pretty rare for women to get under 2 hours and I figured I was not in shape to be the #1 woman (learning humility!). Also, by doing some very inexact math, I figured most of my trail running was averaging 13 minute pace so breaking 2:45 would be about that pace. 

**Pre-race**

Oh boy. I was supposed to stay with the aforementioned friends-of-friends in Ennis for the night before the race and then drive up with them in the morning. However, while on my way to Ennis they called to let me know that due to a big mix up with some of their friends who had to drop out last minute to go on a wildfire (#MontanaProblems) one of the rooms had been cancelled and there wouldn't be any room for me unless I slept on the floor. So, my options were to pay 50 bucks to sleep on a hotel room floor, camp up at where the race is, or leave at 3am to make it to the race the next day. I knew a couple people camping up there but I figured since I had to turn around to head home to get my camping gear if I chose that option that I might as well just go to bed early and sleep in my own bed instead of planning an impromptu camping trip at 7pm the night before a half-marathon.

I was planning on just driving myself in a big suffer-fest but luckily I have some angels for friends who volunteered to wake up at 3am and drive me the 3 hours to the race. We did exactly that and I not only got to the race in plenty of time, I got to watch the sun rise over the Madison Mountains after waking up from a nice little truck nap. Had a quick breakfast, grabbed my bib, put on my vest with my trusty bear spray, and got in school buses for the drive to the start. The race is a point-to-point and there's no place to park at the start so everyone parks at the finish and then gets driven to start. It was a very weird feeling to drive over the very place you'll be running in 15 minutes. 

**Race**

The race starts at 9,250 feet with an incredibly steep uphill. I started out running because it feels weird to start a race by walking but started walking about a quarter into the hill. My race strategy (worked out while doing this hill lol, I am clearly not great at planning ahead) was to be very chill (aiming for 13 mile pace) until mile 6, catalogue how I'm feeling and then decide if I'm gonna push it or just maintain for the rest of the race. I came through mile 1 in 12:15 (the race director had put out cones marking out each mile which was a life-saver) and mile 2 in about 10:30 which made sense as mile 2 was mostly downhill. Around here I found myself in probably the top 25 of the race which made me a little nervous as I hadn't planned for that but I consoled myself by figuring it was probably just because they started the marathoners with us. 

The race is along the Gravelly Range and spends a lot of time at 9,600 feet. The altitude didn't bother me which I chalk up to living at 5,000 feet and running a lot in the mountains at even higher altitude. There were a lot of (1+ mile) climbs which I decided merited a run/walk combo where I would count to 120 while power walking and then start running for a bit until my calves told me to walk again. This strategy meant that for the first 2/3rds of the race I passed people while they walked and then they'd pass me while I'd walked. I was not a fan of this, I think mostly because I've become a running misanthrope from my lonely trail runs. My body felt pretty good when I passed through mile 6 aside from some stomach pain from drinking too much gatorade (dumb move on my part; I generally rarely drink on my runs but all the people with running vests made me feel like I should) but I had faith that it would pass and it mostly did within a couple of miles. 

At mile 7 I decided it was time to actually start trying to run instead of keeping it easy. This morphed into a goal to not get passed for the rest of the race and a plan to push the flats and the uphills and just coast on the downhills. Ironically the downhills were my least favorite part in the back half of the race because in my tired state I felt less stable on them in the gravel and because I could tell they were beating up my quads (contributing to the instability). With a couple of miles to go I figured that I was on pace for a 2:14 as long as I didn't blow up. With probably .5 miles to go I saw woman with a medal around her neck walking towards me. I wrongly interpreted this as meaning I was just around the corner from finishing and let me tell you there is no worse feeling than rounding a corner expecting the finish and seeing nothing but trees. Somehow kept running through the sadness and crossed the finish in 2:14.36. I was proud of the time but honestly more proud of my pace predicting ability. All those college workouts working on pace sense paid off I guess.

**Post-race**

Chilled at the finish and cheered for my friends as they came in. Got some watermelon, drank a beer. Walked around knowing my calves were gonna kill me later and then hitched a ride with my friends for the bumpy 1.5 hour ride back to Ennis. Met up with some other friends and we had beer and pizza at the Burnt Tree Brewery before stopping at Norris Hot Springs on the way home in the mid-90s heat. Is there any better post-race activity that beer, pizza and hot springs? No.

This race definitely reminded me of how fun it is to have a goal so the plan from here is to try to up my mileage more to be able to tackle a local trail 30k in September. I'd also like to run this half again and I think, with the right training I could win it. First place this year (first *and* second were women!) ran a 1:50 and I think if I started running more than 30 miles a week and did something other than easy runs I could win it. 

**TL;DR** Washed-up runner gets back on the horse, runs a half-marathon at 9,000 feet a lot faster than she expects and celebrates with beer, pizza, and geothermally heated water.

Yesterday was the first 12 miler for the training cycle - and at mile 10.5 the same thing happened with my calves - inside of both started biting - I was able to get them stretched out and finish the run. It was muggy and my shirt and shorts were soaked through with sweat (as normal). 

For nutrition, I start with UCAN Pre just before the run (which usually covers me for 90 min), then a Spring gel at 90 min and another at 2 hours (2:13 run yesterday). Took a Salt Stick Salt Caplet at the start and at the halfway point along with 2 chewables during the run. Went through 44oz of Sword (I use that instead of plain water for the sodium, calories and electrolytes.

This matches how I have approached both previous marathons. I used to think the calf cramps were dehydration based/lack of sodium but after yesterday I am not so sure. Could it be I am taking in too much sodium/nutrition for the run (that was suggested)? Could it be that 700mg per hour of sodium wasn't enough? Or should I really be looking at biomechanics (overworked calves)?

724,AdvancedRunning,BobGalaxy,How to procede/train for the rest of 2021,"**Goal:** First/new PBs in the 5k, 10k and HM

**Races:** Taking place between September and December (HM: mid September or mid October)

**Question:** How to train for the rest of the year for best results in all races? If I really have to choose only one, I'd pick the HM as the goal race

**Background and more Info:** M35. I've got into running late and have almost no racing experience.  I train mostly continously since the beginning of 2020 and increase my mileage (before this I'd only run during the summer and low volume). Currently I'm at 140km/week, loosely structured with a long run (28-35km), and some faster workouts (LT, Intervals), but no focused training plan yet. I raced a spontaneous 10k a week ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/o71s9k/spontaneous\_5k10k\_next\_week\_goal\_suggestion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/o71s9k/spontaneous_5k10k_next_week_goal_suggestion/)) without tapering as a fitness test. Not optimal, but it was my first 10k race and I'm happy with the result (34:44). 

I think now is the time to switch into a focused training plan and the first race I got in mind is a 5k at the beginning of September. I own books by Daniels and Pfitzinger (faster road racing) and prefer the approach of the latter with faster long runs. All the training plans except for one HM plan are less mileage than where I'm at right now. Is it reasonable to stay at or even increase my mileage by picking one of the plans and just adding (easy) miles? I'm a bit lost on how to best approach the rest of the year, so help is very welcome!

\### Training

Back in a marathon build after running 1600TT in early June.

&amp;#x200B;

3 Weeks at 60+ MPW

1 Week at 50 miles (on vacation)

1 Week at 49 miles (race week, includes half marathon race)

&amp;#x200B;

I added in a rest day to my weekly training about 3 weeks ago. I feel a lot fresher and notice that I have less niggles during the week. With a rest day, typical schedule looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

M: Rest

T: 8mi easy with drills/strides

W: 10mi (run a hilly route at a steady pace or 6mi tempo baked in)

Th:8mi easy

F: 6-8mi easy with drills/strides

Sa: Mix of tempo/interval work. Typically 10-12 miles

Su: LR (at least 14 mi)

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really taper that well for this race. 2 weeks prior I traveled to Texas for a week and ate/drank way too much. Ran a lot just to keep the weight off. Temperature was warm as well. 4 days prior to the race, I did a nice 2mi tempo (6:28/mi), 2x800 (2:47/rep), 2x400 (77/rep) workout to get the legs moving faster. I didn't do much speed work on vacation and this felt comfortable. Th,Fri, Sat were easy runs with drills/strides at the end

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Race was at 7am with 6:30am packet pickup. Woke up at 4am. I use a bunch of BPN products so had my usual greens/in focus (caffeine) drink to get the bowels moving. Had a slice of toast with butter. Finished up with an electrolyte drink. This is my normal routine before long runs. Did this for an 18mi LR recently with 16oz of water and 2 GUs. Felt just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Drank another electrolyte drink about 30 mins before race. 2mi warm up with drills/strides. Race start was delayed by about 15mins. I sat down for about 10mins and probably should have done some drills/strides again

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Within a few steps of the start, I felt my hamstring tighten up. It felt like a cramp but not really sure how that was possible. Went away but this came back to haunt me later.

&amp;#x200B;

Weather was 70 degrees and over 90% humidity during the entire race. Something I really should have respected more.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan was to go out in 6:40 for the first 4mi and then 6:30 for the next 4. Depending on how I felt, would try to maintain or pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 1-4: Per my splits above, clearly failed at going out slower. Lead pack of 6 went out fast. Probably under 6:00/mi. I let them go but the group behind me was too slow. At mile 2, someone dropped off in the lead pack and he stayed with me for the next mile. But after that, I was on my own for the entire race. My lovely hamstring tightness came back again towards the end of mile 3 but it definitely felt more like a cramp this time around. Was planning to take a gel at mile 5. Instead, took a GU and water at mile 4. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 5-7: With concerns about cramping, I dialed back the pace for mile 5. However, I felt good aerobically so couldn't stay disciplined and ended up picking up the pace again for miles 6-7. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 8-10: Again felt my hamstring start to cramp so I popped my last gel. Missed the water station at mile 8 and didn't get water again until mile 10. After I popped my gel, I made the call to slow down and just finish the race. Passed one more guy who fell off from the lead pack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 11-Finish: It finally happened at mile 11. My left hamstring fully locked up. I stopped and stretched it out. Based on the disparity between my moving time on strava (also stopped my watch for a minute) and official time, probably stopped completely for 2-3 minutes. I was almost certain that I would cramp again through the last couple miles. Somehow did not.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Finished 5th overall. Though I'm pretty sure the course is short since both Strava/Garmin are showing under 13 mi.  Aside from the very start, no one passed me even with my cramp. If I didn't cramp, the next guy finished 8mins ahead of me so I still would have been by myself. Friend works at a nearby restaurant and had a few beers with him after. As I'm writing this, my right hamstring is starting to cramp up...

&amp;#x200B;

\### Learnings and Next Steps

Disappointed about cramping up but I'm happy with the effort and more importantly, the things I learned. It's still a PR for me. My last official race was this same race 3 years ago and I ran something like 1:44.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously would have liked a better gut check on my current fitness. The temperature really didn't help. And I should have adapted my race plan as a result. Pacing needs to improve and this was a good lesson. I've gotten away with this in prior TTs (10k) but over a half and especially a marathon, I need to be more disciplined.

&amp;#x200B;

As for next steps, still planning to hit a BQ in September. My confidence is shaken a bit after feeling cramps so early in this race. While I can put some blame on the weather, nutrition is still a work in progress. Over the coming weeks, will start mixing in more interval stuff (800s, 1k) at 3k/5k pace and continue to increase the LR. There is some silver lining that aerobically, I felt good. Just the cramping is really what did me in. Between fully locking up and slowing down in the miles prior to try to avoid cramping, I'm confident that lower 1:20s is doable with better weather.

[Reuters: Olympics host city Tokyo bans spectators amid COVID-19 emergency](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-set-declare-state-emergency-tokyo-area-through-aug-22-minister-2021-07-08/)

&gt; TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - The Olympics will take place without spectators in host city Tokyo, organisers said on Thursday, as a resurgent coronavirus forced Japan to declare a state of emergency in the capital that will run throughout the Games.

&gt; The move marked a sharp turnabout from as recently as last week, when some officials were still insisting they could organise the Games safely with some fans. It all but strips the global sporting showpiece, which is due to start on July 23 and run until Aug. 8, of its last vestiges of pomp and public spectacle.

&gt;Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said it was essential to prevent Tokyo, where the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 variant was spreading, from becoming a flashpoint of new infections.

&gt; People will also be asked not to gather for events on public roads, such as the triathlon, though officials said some venues outside the greater Tokyo metropolitan area would allow small numbers of spectators.

However, with a recent 50K I got my average weekly mileage up to 40-50mpw.

I’ve taken some time off structured training since and focused on easy miles, running around 20mpw now and cross training. One of my more recent workouts prior to reducing my mileage was 6x800 with the following results:

748,AdvancedRunning,JamesFattyHarden,Near Sea Level to the Rockies,"Hello, 

I am trying to determine if I have lost, gained, or maintained fitness or how I should interpret these race results after 1 month at elevation. 

First 5K:  Just above freezing, dew point low 30s, at sea level - 17:46

Second 5K: Low 60s, dew point in mid 50s, at 5,000ft above sea level - 19:50


Looking at this [article](https://runnersconnect.net/high-altitude-training-running-performance/) which references actual studies it appears that the typical runner experiences a decrease in V02 max by about 2% for every 1000 feet over 1000ft above sea level. So, at 5,000ft this puts me at essentially an 8% decrease in V02 max. 

**So should I consider that had this effort been done at sea level where I usually train I could have expected to run about 8% faster or about 18:15? And then would running at freezing temps vs low 60s explain the other 30 seconds or have I lost a step of fitness or just simply had a bad run?**

For reference, taken with a grain of salt, I use runalyze and when I was at sea level in the spring I was getting consistent V02 max estimates of 59 on my runs and now this summer at altitude for this past month I'm getting consistent V02 max estimates of 53 which is about an 8% drop.

756,AdvancedRunning,melonlord44,Combining Daniels and Tinman workouts for marathon training,"Hey, I am currently planning my own training based on Daniels, with a T workout on tuesday, I or R workout on friday, and a mostly easy long run on sunday. Im running 45mpw, building up to 55 for marathon in late november, but mainly looking to just get faster and stronger overall rather than focus in on the marathon (it's my first, no time goal). So far it's been good but I am curious about having weeks where I do Tinman type workouts (CV instead of I, tempo instead of T), which seem to be a notch slower than Daniels' paces.

1. My understanding is that Daniels' R, I, and T paces are roughly like mile, 5k, and \~15k paces, and Tinman CV is around 10k pace and tempo is half or slower. And that typical CV workouts are intervals or fartlek like 6x(3min on, 1min off). Is that right?
2. Does this make any sense? The appeal is it's a little less stress and gets more coverage across the pace spectrum, and also those paces are more fun to run than I and T. But I could also just do easier workouts, and according to daniels the second point doesn't really matter. Mainly just curious if anyone does this and what your thoughts are on it. Also would it be better to alternate weeks and schedule it out, or just do the tinman style workouts on weeks when I'm not feeling it?",1625768952

### Background

A sub 2:00 800m has been a life-goal for me for many years now. After a couple year haitus, I started training properly again in 2019/2021 and felt good for the upcoming season. Covid struck, prompting me to start adding mileage in liu of speed as I assumed that races in the Summer of 2020 were out of the question. However, during one of our brief forays out of lockdown, I managed to sign up for a few races. I jumped straight out of an anticipated 18 month base-building block to a one month sprint to get some semblence of race sharpness. I ended up with a SB (and PB) of 2:00.29.

Fast-forward to the beginning of the 2021 track season and I was feeling supremely confident. I had just moved to a quick new training group with a great coach and had just completed the most productive block of Winter training to date. An achilles injury kept me out for 6-8 weeks at the start of the year but I had fully recovered and felt I had retained most of the the gains from the previous months. Cue the first race of the season in mid May and I had a horrendous race; boxed from the start, expended way too much energy in the first lap and felt like I was swimming in the last 150m. I finished in an extremely disappointing 2:01.70. No matter... first race of the season, just lacking race fitness and a little speed endurance, plus the wind was quite strong, right? 

This turned out to be no real anomaly, in my next three 800m races I clocked times of 2:03.30, 2:01.47 and 2:00.70. In an attempt to change it up I even deliberately ran the last one in negative splits (61/59). The frustrating thing was that the people I was training alongside were clocking times of 1:56/57 and I was training just as well as them! I told my coach that all I needed to go sub 2 was to run it as a 1 x 800m training rep and I was only half joking. I had the speed to go sub 2 (my 400m is probably around 52) and with my mileage and Winter training I should have plenty of stamina. I decided there were a couple areas that I needed to improve: the first of which was becoming comfortable with race pace and the other was improving my speed endurance as I was slowing a massive amount over the last 200m.

### Training

I follow a relatively straightforward middle distance programme with 3 quality track sessions, 2 easy runs, 1 long run and 1 day of full recovery. We are now at about the halfway point of the season so our sessions are getting progressively sharper with fewer reps and longer recovery. As an example, last week my quality sessions were the following:

- Tuesday: 4 x 400m [8:00] (59, 57, 56, 56)
- Thursday: 3 x 3 x 300m [2:00, 5:00] (47, 44, 42, 49, 45, 44)
- Saturday: 2 x 600m [18:00] (1:30.3, 1:28.2)

Regarding my perceived weakness at race pace I completed a 8 x 300m [1:30] session with all the reps done in 45s. And for my speed endurance I focused on sessions like the 2 x 600m [18:00], aiming to get into lactic and push close to race effort.

### Pre-race

I used to warm up for races slightly differently to training, doing extra drills and slightly different striding. However, I've decided that there is no reason to do anything too different to training, especially since I've been performing better in training than races recently! So I did my light jog, leg swings, drills and long strides and was ready to go.

I don't really get nervous before a race. I just tell myself that all I can do now is run as hard as I can and everything else is out of my control. So long as I put my all into the race then I can be (relatively) content.

The wind was strong and I was in lane 1. Let's go.

### Race

I went out hard, I've been told by enough people that the first 40m of an 800m is ""free"" that I now consider it a fact of racing. At the 100m break I was slightly surprised, but not displeased, to find myself leading apart from the pacemaker (pacing 400m at 57). I focused on staying comfortable and strong through 200, I thought I heard the 200m split called out at 25/26 which I ignored because that's way too fast. On the second bend I had a moment of clarity as I noticed the pacemaker, who was a couple metres ahead, have a tiny stumble. I don't know why but this felt important at the time. Into the home straight and the wind hit, *hard*. I took what little shelter I could behind the pacemaker and carried on. Towards the end of the straight I felt some of the other racers coming alongside me. That's fine, I thought, I'm not racing these people, it's only the clock I care about.

The pacemaker went through in a *perfect* 57.0 and I was around a half second behind. I managed to maintain the inside lane through the bend, someone passed me in lane two and a couple more went past in the back straight. This was great stuff, more potential wind breaks for when the gale force wind hits in the last 100m! 200m to go... I heard 1:28 as I passed. Ok, I've been in this position before, lets not fuck it up this time. I don't really remember running the last 200m, I think this is the point at which the lizard brain just completely takes over. A lizard brain that I had tricked into thinking that the only important thing at this moment was to make it to the end of this red strip of rubber, and to do it *as quickly as humanly possible*. Of course, this was also probably helped by the fact that I had found myself in a sprint finish with two other athletes. Pure pain and the home straight was almost done, I remembered where I was and made a comically oversized dip for the line then fell to my knees. 

### Post-race

I had lost. Which was annoying not for the fact that I hadn't bettered my fellow athletes but instead because it meant that the time on the board was not my own. It read 1:57.25, I was surely less than 3 seconds behind that guy right? But then again, your mental clock isn't at it's best in the dying moments of an 800m. What I was sure of was that it was close, possibly agonisingly so. I wasn't going to get my hopes up.

I had two objectives in my mind at this point: firstly to find out my time and secondly to get home in time to watch football come home. While I struggled to remove my (regretably non-super) spikes a friend came over to show me the times for my race. I had done it! It wasn't really joy that I felt but something far more akin to relief. No longer would I have to engage in conversations regarding the ifs, whens and whys of my sub 2 attempts. No longer would I have to engage in the mini crisis that is describing my old PB; do I say ""two point two nine"" or ""two dead point two nine"" or just ""two minutes""? And no longer would I have to look in the mirror every day and see a pathetic non sub two runner staring back, I had now conquered this arbitrary threshold and could hold my head up high, I was now a *pretty good* runner.

In November of 2020, I started having problems catching my breath/feeling incredibly out of breath--almost like I was going to suffocate to death. I couldn't eat without it happening. The drastic drop in my quality of life made me very depressed. After MONTHS of going to various doctors multiple times a week, I was told I have a sliding hiatal hernia. I began to control my diet even more which helped to alleviate some of the symptoms. 

However, it has flared up again, causing my training for this ultra to come almost to a halt. Five miles leaves me gasping for air, regurgitating food, and being able to literally feel my stomach slide above my diaphragm. My diet is the best it's ever been, I'm 6' 3"", 165 lbs (so I don't really have weight to loose), I don't smoke, drink, etc. Any tips for being able to keep running? I'm worried the only way to keep it from flaring up will be to stop doing one of the most rewarding things in my life.

This is mostly caused by preferring a long run every 10 days and not knowing if I should focus on hills, speed, LT, or VO2max. I understand the logic of base building, working in some intensity and then tapering. But I find that my weak areas are hills, speed, and long tempos a little below my LT, which naturally seems high anyways so I don’t get much benefit from traditional LT runs of 20 minutes. So I’m basically all over the place with my training because I try to follow the typical philosophy but then shift to my weak areas in a way that seems out of sequence with what the current philosophy recommends.

I ran NYC in 2019 and blew up at mile 18- shuffling home in 4:40 ( was hoping to break 4)- maxed out at 55 mpw
I haven’t raced since - had shoulder surgery in Aug 2020 and covid in Jan 2021 , both of which disrupted my training somewhat.
I’ve been healthy since and am averaging about 40 mpw over past 12 weeks with LR of 13, some strides once a week and occasional mile repeats at tempo (3x1 mi, 2 mi + 1 mi).
My “ White Whale “ is a 4 hour marathon. I’m looking at a smaller race in late March 2022 to attempt.
In prepping for that I was going to train to run a half in late Oct and use that to transition to marathon training.
My other option is to just focus on another 3 months of base building and get my weekly mileage up to mid 50s for a good duration before going into a marathon training block in the winter. I know I have the speed to run sub 4- I need the endurance , hence my thought on just focusing on mileage.

767,AdvancedRunning,ruinawish,Making Hansons Advanced Marathon plan more... advanced,"**Background details:** 30ish, M, aiming for a sub 2:40 marathon in October (PB 2:50 in 2019). Currently at 80km/50mi per week, and will try push into +100km/60mi (coming off two years of niggly injuries). Have previously hit 150km/93mi per week.

I've recently started Hansons advanced marathon plan ([**2018 Summer Series  review on Hansons**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/4twcbg/the_summer_series_hansons/) for those unfamiliar with Hansons). I've previously adapted it loosely with success when training for a marathon and ultramathon.

Hansons has a chapter on 'Schedule modifications' which are all very reasonable: adding to easy runs, running on the rest day, adding to the long run, doubling as you get to 90-100mi. 

My main query is how I can ramp up the tempo runs, and whether I should.

Week | Tempo @MP | Total mileage |
:--:|:--:|:--:
3 | 6mi/10km | 46mi/77km
4 | 6mi/10km | 45mi/75km
5| 6mi/10km | 47mi/80km
6 | 7mi/11km | 47mi/80km
7 | 7mi/11km | 54mi/88km
8 | 7mi/11km | 49mi/82km
9 | 8mi/13km | 57mi/94km
10 | 8mi/13km | 50mi/84km

13 | 9mi/14km| 62mi/101km
14 | 9mi/14km | 55mi/92km
15 | 10mi/16km | 63mi/103km
16 | 10mi/16km | 56mi/91km
17 | 10mi/16km | 55mi/92km
18 | Race week | 52mi/88km

I've previously done Pfitz-inspired marathon pace runs of up to 18mi/30km previously, often incorporated into the long run. So part of me wants to have my tempo runs in this training block getting near to that distance. The main difference is Hansons is 15 straight weeks of tempo runs, built on the concept of cumulative fatigue; whereas I was making it up as I went along previously.

**Modification ideas:**

* Peak at 13mi/21km-18mi/30km tempo around week 15/16, then taper down the tempo. The idea of the week 17 tempo at 10mi/16km doesn't blow me away.

* That means incrementally ramping up the tempo distance each week, so as to avoid big jumps. I also like the psychological win of achieving a longer tempo run each week.

* If my tempo run goes into the 13mi/21km-18mi/30km range, start incorporating them into the long run.

* Tempo / weekly mileage = 13-15%, so my modifications should match that ratio (though not applicable to a 18mi/30km tempo, so that would have go into the long run). 

It's worth noting that Hansons includes a sample elite plan in their appendix, and modifications of how the elite runners do it. I don't find it that helpful because it varies considerably from the formula of their beginner and advanced plans, i.e. they do a 9 day cycle; the tempo runs are rarely straightforward @MP runs, but instead are often progressive runs; 

Keen to receive any ideas or opinions.

Ultimately, if it gets too hard or too complicated, I'll either go back to the default Advanced program format, or start improvising again (e.g. do a long tempo within the LR, then skip the next week's tempo).",1625656970

I am battling chronic calf strains. I genetically have huge calves, which seems to be a blessing and a curse because I keep straining them (left or right) every 3-9 months. 

My guess is that the latest strain (one week ago) came from overtraining / pushing the anaerobic threshold too hard - I felt a clear twinge at the end of a hard, hilly 5 miler. Had been gradually adding 10-15% weekly mileage and was at 35mpw plus cross training.

I gave it 2 days rest then ran 1 mile and had to stop to avoid reaggravation. Then I waited 5 days and ran 2 miles, which felt better, but again had to stop in fear of reaggrivation. I could feel the calf tightening up both times and stopped in my tracks.

I’m wondering if anyone has a good prescription/timeline for treating this? They usually go away in 2-5 days so this one is a bit more severe. Have been foam rolling - also have zero pain while cross training or walking, running is the issue. I have the NYC Marathon in November and really don’t want to jeopardize training but I know rest is probably a necessity for at least another week…

I did have a minor foot injury and Achilles tendinitis that seem to have gone away. I took a little under 2 weeks off after the half marathon on June 19th.

I'm running with a friend that has marathon experience as well, but in slightly less than stellar shape. We ran the half marathon together. He does ok on our training runs but starts to lag when his heart rate gets up there,  then starts wheezing a bit. We did the half in 2:17 with running and walking. I could have done less walking and more running but stuck with my friend throughout. 

The marathon is September 19th. Hopefully there are no setbacks between either of us, but I fear he isn't progressing as well as he should even with some cross training on his bike. We ran 4.5 miles this past Saturday and walked a brief section around 3 miles in.

Coming to the conclusion of a long track season I have been in a 21 day sharpening / taper zone as I compete in championship season races. The past weeks have included conference (8/16/32), regionals (16/32), states (16/32), and nationals (5k). 

Through early June I maintained between 60 miles per week with a dedicated low volume explosive day. This workout emphasized lateral movements, plyometrics, bounding, and sprint mechanics. I ran an additional one or two workouts depending on the presence of a race. A typical no-race week might be explosive Monday, an aerobic workout, such as 8 x 1000m at 10k pace (3:10/km) on Wednesday, and 2 miles at threshold (~10:20) followed by 6 x 300 at mile pace (:48s) on Friday. Saturdays are long runs, typically 12-14 miles at 6:30-45 pace/mile. Sundays alternate between a rest day and a mix of 4-5 miles light with cross training. 

In the week leading up to the race I was attempting to both recover from my 1 second PR (4:11) in the mile on June 25 and prepare for the 5k, a distance which I have not raced nor target trained for in 8 months. The highlight of the week was 4 x 600 at 5k pace (1:48) followed by a speedy 500-300-100 cutdown four days out. Two days out, I ran on Pre’s Trail (5 miles) which is a big cross off of the bucket list. 

**Race**

Eugene was still recovering from the record heatwave, although conditions had improved slightly. At start time, I was faced with clear skies and 80 degrees F temperatures. As to be expected in a high school race, the field took off too fast, so I stayed near last place for a few laps. This was still enough to earn my fastest split of the race, a 2:56 first kilometer. At this point in the race, I knew that other runners would start to “go to sleep” and/or pay for their ambitious start. Throughout kilometers two and three I steadily moved up through the field. The temperature had been climbing steadily and multiple athletes had already passed out or stepped off. 

Consideration was also taken to the rail, as many of us were not used to having an  inside rail and were stumbling. With 2k to go, I made an effort to reconnect to the front of the chase pack to set up a successful final 1600m. This is where the race started to hurt for me. At what felt like maximum exertion, I was only hanging on to pace and certainly not making up ground on the leaders. Despite this, hearing the bell and knowing I was on pace to break 15 minutes helped me to close in 67 seconds.  

**Analysis**
Although I missed the top 6, and with that coveted All American status, I was extremely pleased with my time. This was my first 5k not on a cross country course, where my PR lay in the mid 15’s. Additionally, while I have a good aerobic base through good training load and V02 max workouts, most of my training has targeted mid distance for the last 3 months. 

As mentioned in the title, this was my last race of high school, making it especially bittersweet. I am currently writing this back on the East coast with my toes in the ocean on recovery week. Looking forward, I will be running division 1 cross country and am excited to start my summer training soon!",1625583041

# Training:

I’m a 25 year old make who had run intermittently, but without any real distance-work (mainly the weekly 5km) on and off for 2020, a year after I stopped playing football at a semi-pro level in Australia. So this was my first ever training block in running and began at the start of February and ended up being continually prolonged and set back as the SMH Half Marathon was itself set back thanks to *youknowwhat*. The plan followed was a HR-based intermediate half-marathon program provided within Garmin Connect. It basically consisted of five days of running. Two easy days of about 45 minutes of running, two day of speed-work whether that be threshold sessions or interval training and then a long run to round out the week on Sunday. Mileage maxed out at about 65km per week.  Some key workouts that gave me pre-race confidence included: 

Longer tempo work:  [https://www.strava.com/activities/5460815169](https://www.strava.com/activities/5460815169)

# Pre-race:

Three days before the race, a COVID outbreak in Sydney cancelled the event, but hey, I get free entry next year. I should also note that most of my training had been fasted so the race too, I entered with just some coffee and water in my system. Maybe I could improve on this,  but I just went with what I knew I was comfortable with.

# Race: 

So I still wanted to test my fitness and picked my next day completely off work to do so. I chose an area - the Olympic Park - down here where I had logged a fair few of my training runs and set off at with my goal pace of 4:00min/km in mind.  

**Kilometres 1-10:**  Pretty quickly, I settled into a decent pace, under my goal pace of 4:00min/km. I thought I might pay for this later on, having never raced this distance but also knew that if I wanted to tick off my goals, I’d have to come under that pre-determined pace anyway. Overall effort was at a 6 or 7 out of 10 at this time.  

**Kilometres 10-16:**  My pacing strategy was to keep things under control till the 16-kilometre or 10-mile mark and then send it for the final 5km. But these kilometres particularly from 12-15 seemed the most mentally taxing. I had to remain focused and it was tough. RPE was probably moving into an 8 or so and while the legs felt good, the mind was fatiguing. Oh, I also took a gel at kilometre 15, for peace of mind more than anything else, I’d say.  

**Kilometres 16-21.1**:  The final 5km push. I had been warned that effort levels would go through the roof, and if you were lucky, you;’d be able to maintain pace, rather than actually speed up. This seemed pretty bang on in my experience. I focused hard on remaining consistent with my breathing and simply taking quicker more frequent steps. I knew my average pace was a fair bit quicker than I had anticipated but not exactly where it would land me, so just tried my hardest to really leave it all out there in the final kilometre. Coming in in just under 1:21:00 with some wobbly legs!

# Post-race

788,AdvancedRunning,Ptyix,How abnormal is my progress after 4 months?,"I mean abnormally bad, lol. Not kidding. (Sorry for posting here as casual beginner, I'd just like to see what more experienced runners say.)

I realize this is difficult or impossible to really evaluate, I just mean a rough assessment.

- 32m, no particular health issues known, in normal weight range, some recreational athletic experience in the past, last 5 years almost completely inactive, non-smoker.

- On average ran about 3-4 times a week, 30-60 minutes. A variety of run-and-walk, continuous running up to 90 minutes, shorter runs, some barefoot indoor runs, some rare strides. Had to pause a few times a couple of days due to some minor foot pain. Didn't follow any specific training plan, mostly trying to aim for aerobic base.

- I'd say my hr max is around 198 (might be off, based on observations/equations).

- Ran 75k last month, 10,7 hours. (No data for previous months.)

- First tracked run a month ago was 5,2k in 45:44. After first k in 8:35 my hr was 162. Average hr 159, max 173.

- Last week ran 5k in 42 min, about 8:28 per k. After first k my hr was 155. Average hr 147.

- About a week ago I ran 10k in 1:27, setting pace so that hr stays around 130 (70% of what I then thought was my hr max).

- Today ran 4,2k in 38:33. After first k in 8:06 hr was 161. Then slowed to around 9:25, average hr still 153, max 167... hmm.

All based on Huawei Band 4 Pro sensors, often with non-available GPS/internal tracker instead. hr numbers seem reasonable enough, around 160 my breathing definitely indicates it's not a proper easy run pace any more.

Even considering mistakes (running consistently too fast maybe, no cross training or additional exercises), this seems exceptionally bad after almost 4 months. Is this some outlier level of bad? Am I some kind of biomolecular anomaly?",1625444528
789,AdvancedRunning,steve1138,Advice on Achilles Injury,"Background: I am 29 years old. Ran XC in high school and college.  Took a few years off, then started running again a couple years ago. 

I have had Achilles pain while running since the end of April.  It has also flared up occasionally over the last few years.  This is not my first time with Achilles difficulties since i started running again a couple years ago, but these are my most severe and long lasting difficulties.  I was never injured at all in high school or college.

When I first starting hurting in of April/early May I would start pretty stiff during runs and then it would loosen up after a mile or two, and then would start hurting more sharply around mile 6 or 7.  It wasn't getting better so I took a week and a half off in May.  I then started building up relatively slowly with 20-30 mile weeks (down from 60ish previously in April).  I thought it was getting better, but then after just a couple weeks of 30ish miles a week, it started hurting again (starting stiff and getting actually pain about 6 miles in).  I then went to see a physical therapist who suggested no running, icing my ankle twice a day, doing ankle stability exercises.  I have rested completely with no running the last three weeks. It doesn't hurt at all when just walking around or anything, but is occasionally sore when or after doing eccentric heel drops. 

Just recently, after three weeks totally off, the physical therapist suggested I try jogging again to test.  I ran half a mile yesterday and a mile today. I still feel similar stiffness/soreness in my Achilles.  No intense pain.  I kind of have a feeling that it may not have improved despite three weeks off.

I am curious to hear about other people's experience with Achilles pain. How long does it last? Even if there is no ""pain, are you still aware of it when you start running again/increasing mileage?  I was hoping to hear people's thoughts on my next steps. I am seeing the physical therapist again in a week.  Jog a mile or two a day and see if it just needs to get used to running again?  Go back to no running?  My current PT seems generally knowledgable, but knows very little about running. When do you think I should try going to someone else?

\### Training

Atlanta Track Club puts on these fun come-one-come-all track meets earlier in the spring, so I had been running 50-60mpw doing tempo and interval training for 3k and 5k, running some fast times and having fun in the process. After the last race in early June, I buckled up for some half marathon and 10k pace work in preparation for the Peachtree. 

Some key sessions that made me feel prepared: 

* [Modified 1600/800 Michigan workout](https://www.strava.com/activities/5510323886), closing the last 800 in 2:26
* [8x1k @ goal 10k pace](https://www.strava.com/activities/5479137087), 90s rest, even splits for 5:20/mile pace
* [6xmile @ threshold pace,](https://www.strava.com/activities/5526380651) 60s rest, feeling smooth

I tend to convince myself to train through races, which isn't super effective given I haven't been racing much through the pandemic, so I gave myself a full week taper, which definitely paid off. Going into the race, I knew I was in good shape to attack my PR, but the Peachtree course has a notorious ""V"" elevation profile, where the late-race pain and hills drain your legs. I also treated myself to some Vaporflys for a little back-pocket confidence. 

\### Pre-race

Woke up at 4:30am and downed two cups of coffee before taking public transit to the start line. I squeezed in a mile jog and then did a few drills while meeting friends at the start line. The Peachtree is always fun because if you're lucky enough to get in the first start wave, you warm up with the elite field. This year's lineup was excellent, so I had to contain myself doing drills next to Jake Riley, Galen Rupp, Sara Hall, and the like. 

\### Race

There were an insane number of people in the first heat and I made the mistake of getting smushed to the side, so I was trying to move and get around people for a hot minute. Came through the first mile 15 seconds slower than expected, so I picked it up a little, which wasn't risky as the next two miles are completely downhill. At this point, I enjoyed the excitement of racing and how much the Vaporflys smoothed the downhill pounding. 

My family cheered me on around the third mile, which is bittersweet as I appreciate their support, but their positioning means the hills are coming. Came through 5k in 16:40 so I knew I still had a shot at a PR and at least knew I had some wiggle room for the hills. The key to the course is realizing that the first two hills are nasty, then the following hills are much shallower with a mostly downhill last mile. So I gritted my teeth and tried to balance between slowing too much and overworking my legs. I also pulled away from a pack here and got strung out between a few people. 

From here, I was very familiar with the course and just focused on picking off people and maintaining pace. The cheater shoes definitely worked their magic because my legs felt a lot less beat up than I expected them to at this point. For the uninitiated, the Peachtree follows along Peachtree Street for the first \~5.5 miles, then turns onto another road for a mostly downhill finish. As soon as I hit the turn, I started the kick, knowing it would be painfully long, but mercifully downhill. I passed one guy and fought him off for the finish, which was enough to secure sub 33:30 and a big PR!

\### Post-race

That post-race mix of pain, relief, and satisfaction hits different. Once again, the Peachtree rewards the fast start wave at the finish as you get to see the elites giving their post race interviews. We spotted Rupp and Mike Smith sulking away after his third mediocre 10k in the past month lol... 

Met up with some friends for cooldown and jogged around Piedmont Park. Recapped the race at a friends apartment over waffles and beer then prepared for the inevitable midday caffeine/booze/race crash.

Very excited to come away with a PR after a year of meh pandemic training, as I think many can relate to. Hopefully I'll have another opportunity this summer or fall to chase sub 33 on a flatter course. Hopefully this inspires some of you to check out the United State's biggest 10k and one of the most fun races I've ever done!",1625435674

**Background**

I have always loved running and started training more seriously September 2020, when I signed up for a full Marathon. I figured 4-5 months of training was going to allow me to build my base and finish it without walking and under 4 hours. However, after my first daughter was born in January my training went out the window. I wasn't getting much sleep, I was lacking motivation... so I ended up downgrading to a HM. I completed the race with little training hoping to break 2 hours, I blew up in the second half during lack of training and going out too fast, but was able to barely break 2 hours by less than a minute. After the race I decided to sign up for the Peachtree and I set as a goal to train well for the 10K, which is a distance I feel comfortable with and I have ran plenty of times. I wanted to start building up my base but suffered from Achilles tendon issues and shin splints, I was really starting to struggle thinking that I was never going to be able to build up my mileage. I slowed down my easy runs and started a building plan from Pfitzinger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Training**

I did the 12/30 Pfitzinger building phase after a marathoner friend recommended it and put a lot of emphasis on actually building my mileage without going balls to the wall on every run, which I believe that has been the source of most of my injuries. First weeks felt great and given that the plan increases the mileage gradually I kept feeling amazing as the miles went up and remained injury free. I hit 30mpw a month away from the race and hit 34mpw the week before, I didn't tapper as most of my miles were super easy at a very comfortable pace. Given that most of my miles were slow I wanted to do some sort of tune up workout the week of the race (I decided on Tuesday to have 5 days of rest) to see how my legs felt so I did 5 repeats of 1-mile @ 10K target pace with 90 seconds resting. I surprised myself and was able to run all the repeats under 7:05, even though my target pace was 7:15. I felt really confident given that I put in the work but still had the nerves of not having run under 45 mins before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-race**

Start time was 6:30am so woke up at 4:00am to eat some oats with half a banana and a cup of coffee. I pulled up YouTube and watched some Kipchoge inspirational videos just to get me hyped for the race. My father in law picked us up and dropped us off close to the start line at 5:40am. It gave me a little under an hour to jog a mile, get the mandatory porta potty break and some strides. I went up to my wave start where I was going to meet with my marathoner friend that recommended me the Pfitzinger plan. He is coming out of an injury so he offered to be my personal pacer to go sub 45, what a great guy he is. I went over a million strategies on my head and decided to stick to a slight negative split, which was going to be challenging because the first half is downhill and the second half has a couple of hills and it's flat for the rest of the course including a decent downhill in the last half mile on the way to the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

**Race**

*Miles 1-3 (7:23 - 7:00 - 7:01)*

My plan was to start the first mile at around 7:20, which is a comfortable pace to put me in a great spot to run a negative split. It was my first time running it and rumors say that most people go all out in the first 3 miles and hit a wall when the hills start. I was right on the number in my first mile, zigzagging through people. Miles 2 and 3 were downhill (73ft and 116ft according to Strava) and I tried holding back because I was going below 7:00/mi without realizing it. I was right on the numbers for the two miles and felt great building up to the second half of the race.

*Miles 4-5 (7:06 - 7:02)*

Here is where the race started for me, I worked through the hills trying to stay at around 7:10/mi and would take advantage of the flatter parts. Around 110ft of elevation in these two miles and it was a struggle staying below the goal pace. Getting close to mile 5 I started to feel my legs feeling heavy, so the mental battle started. My friend was feeling great so focusing on keeping up with him got me going. I kept repeating to myself how hard I have been training and how it was time to just execute and push through it because it would be well worth it at the end. Gotta love when we become our own mental coaches!

*Miles 6-finish (6:43 - 1:35)*

Time to close out this damn race and break the 45 minute barrier (for all the people that said I was crazy for attempting a PR at this course), that is what got me going! I still have no idea how I got the kick to run mile 6 at that pace, thinking about the finish line was probably it. I was hurting, my chest was on fire but I wasn't going to hold back anything, it was time to empty the tank! I took advantage of the final half mile being downhill so got my kick going and when there was about 200m to go my friend move to the side and said ""It's all you man!"". Pulled a final sprint to the finish line to not only break 45 minutes but also 44 and I was ecstatic!

**Unofficial time:** 43:49 PR!!!

**Overall:** 839 out of 24,601 (at the moment of writing this)

**M25-29:** 90 out of 974 (at the moment of writing this)

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-race**

I was so excited I didn't know what to do when I finished! I grabbed a water and took some sips to stay hydrated as I didn't drink anything throughout the race and ate a coconut almond bar that they gave us at the end. I stayed around the finish line with a couple of friends waiting for my wife to come in. She ran without any training whatsoever and 6-months postpartum and was able to go sub 65 mins, so she is today's real hero! We went to a nearby restaurant, had a breakfast sandwich with tots and lots of water. Took a nice hot shower to sink in this personal accomplishment, wrote this long novel while I still have the race fresh in my mind and now it's time to enjoy the 4th with some friends.

797,AdvancedRunning,lentilsoupcan,Can someone please help me figure out what type of knee injury I have and what to do about it?,"About a month ago I was biking for about 2 hours (which often makes my knees a little stiff). I wanted to try running after biking (thinking about doing a triathlon) and so I started running immediately after getting off my bike.

As soon as I started running (on a downhill) I felt a pretty strong pain in both knees, which gradually subsided, but didn’t go away completely, for my 40 minute run. 

Since then, the outside of my right knee has been pretty sore. Going down stairs usually causes increased pain, and I can’t run very far without it being too much to bear. Running uphill is especially rough. The pain is felt on the outside of my knee and is worst when bringing my leg forward. 

After trying to run, the pain is more intense for the next day or two, and bending my knee hurts. I basically have to walk around with a straightened right knee to avoid pain.

I’ve been able to do pretty much every other type of exercise except run (bodyweight cardio, biking, lifting), but running is my favorite by far and I want to be able to get back to it as quickly as possible.

I’m thinking I either have an LCL tear, a meniscus tear, or possibly (though less likely) ITBS. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on what they think my injury is, a better way to diagnose it, and/or the best way to recover from it as quickly as possible?

798,AdvancedRunning,RegulusDeneb,Taking Breaks During Long Runs," I am training for my first marathon and have moved to a new area, so I am training with groups that are new to me.

My preference is to carry my water and keep running with may just a brief break at the turnaround.   

What is your preference? I do feel faster after taking a brief walking break in a race, but for training, it seems like it would be better to keep the circulatory system working at the level it needs to to run. Does it decrease the effectiveness of the workout to stand and talk for 1 or 2 minutes every few miles, or for a few minutes after 5 or 6 miles?

803,AdvancedRunning,seanf999,Stress Fracture or Peroneal Tendonitis?,"Thought I'd ask here since I'm guess some of you have experienced something similar.

I've recently amped up the miles (as a novice).  
I've a fitness test coming up for law enforcement (not America), and I've been doing the beep test, now coupled with some road running and cycling, plus some gym/weights work.

I went for a 5k yesterday, first time without stopping (which isn't great but oh well), I felt some discomfort as expected and some sharp pains in my left foot behind the base of the 5th metatarsal (the boney bit on the outside of your foot).  
So it's originating from a spot deep in my foot between that boney spot and my heel.

Today it was far worse, it got worse the more I walked on it, probably wasn't the smartest thing to do but I was working.

I'm hobbling around the place, can't put weight on it, can't walk properly never mind run.  
It's constantly dull and aches, if I walk on it I get sharp pains with each step/push off.  
It's also sore to touch on that spot (Cuboid I'm guess I really don't know).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I went for an X-Ray, which was inconclusive.  
They said it probably wouldn't show anyway.

Said it could be a stress fracture or tendonitis.  
If it's still like this in a week comeback.  


In the mean time I just have to keep off my foot, ice it, anti-inflammatories and I've been told no running.

Can tendonitis be this bad?  
I've had patella tendonitis and that was uncomfortable but not debilitating..

I was working today (on my feet from 7-2) and I have a feel that exacerbated things.

I hope it's not a stress fracture, because I know that'll mean more time not training..

Anyone been in a similar predicament?  


Or can anyone just fill me in on how Tendonitis and Stress Fractures feel/present differently?

I'm not asking for medical advice - just opinions/anecdotes..

I'm leaving the actual diagnosis up to the professionals.

I'm off work until next weekend with it so I have time to rest.

804,AdvancedRunning,jaketuber,Nike Pegasus 36 Replacement?,"I love almost everything about the Pegasus 36 - it's light, neutral, has a thin, breathable upper that's great for humidity and rain, and fits snug on my feet. I just finished putting 900 miles on my fourth pair of them... so you could say I like them. I've used them for easy runs and long runs for the past several training cycles. Unfortunately, the supply of them from outlets and online stores has dried up and I feel like I have to find an alternative. I highly disliked the 37, I thought it was too maximalist, the fit was sloppy, and whoever decided it should have a huge puffy upper should be fired. The replacement shoe doesn't need to be Nike, in fact it would be nice to switch to a more forward-thinking brand. However, I do like having a sleek looking shoe and lots of other trainers out there now (I'm looking at you Mizuno Waverider) are fugly. More of a secondary ask, but something easy on the wallet would also be nice - I run a decent amount and I don't like paying $150 for a pair of new trainers every 3 months.

819,AdvancedRunning,JadenCyjJN,Anyone here also has hydration issues?,"Hi Running friends, I'm a constant runner and I also keep getting this weird hydration issue. I made this post to share my experience and also seek some answers or tips from you guys.

This happens when you gulp too much water at once and your body actually keeps the water in your stomach EVEN after 4 hours (might even be 5 hours) but im sure it doesnt exceed 6 hours. If it does then i suggest visiting a doctor. This makes my long runs hard because *obviously* a heavy stomach with the constant shaking of the body due to running, this will cause a very uncomfortable ""Puking"" sensation in your stomach since the water is shaking so much. You can identify this situation simply by during warmup, just shake your stomach or do some On The Spot jogging, and if you hear *Water Sloshing Sounds* in your stomach then you know your stomach is so called ""Heavy"" and ""full of water"". Sure you can run but you won't get far or fast. The sensation of water is horrible. Imagine trying to increase pace and you start hearing water sloshing noises from your stomach and then the feeling of puking.

How this came about. I've experimented this many many times and the results are quite shocking and amazing. 

Basically I usually run at about 6pm everyday for my long runs. Even at 1 - 2pm, if you take a HUGE Gulp of water, even a Can of soda or drink, if you drink the whole thing in like 2 mins, the liquid will stay in your stomach EVEN at 6pm. Yes, it stays there even after so many hours. You can try it out yourself too. Drink a huge gulp and huge amount of water in a short time at 2pm, then at 6pm shake your body around to agitate the contents of your stomach. You *should* hear a lot of water sloshing sounds.

What i found out that works and also proposed by my Running Coach, is that drinking Small Constant Sips of water is better than a huge gulp. I've done many research about this too and it has shown that Gulp is not good for the body because you are taking in so much water that your kidneys cannot excrete water as fast as you are taking in. Hence causing the water staying in your stomach. You may think, hey maybe the kidney can excrete the water in your stomach after 1 -2 hours. The weird fact is, no. But eventually yes. I've tried drinking sips for hours and hours before my runs and maybe about 1 - 2 hours before my run i drink less sips. It works, and the right way your stomach should feel before running is a light stomach (Almost empty). And when you shake your stomach no sound should be produced. Even Eliud Kipchoge has mentioned he likes a Light Stomach when he runs so he can be faster so he avoids excessive amounts of foods or water before a session. Yesterday at about 1.30 - 2pm, i drank down a whole Can of Chocolate drink, and then at 6pm i hear a huge amount of water sloshing in my stomach. I was quite shocked too... but i see it as normal as i've experienced it many times.

I hope this post is somehow informational and helped some people. But I wanna ask those who are more experienced than me for their opinions, on this topic. 

Summary of my concerns
1. Is it true that water actually stays in your stomach EVEN after so many hours (Caused by Gulping a lot of water in a short time) ?
2. Is there a better solution to this?
3. Anyone has a explanation of this?

822,AdvancedRunning,ItsAllChemistry,changed training routine and I think I am regressing,"I have been running for about 5 years but only in the last 2, I approach it with an 'advanced' mindset. I hired a coach who followed Jack Daniels approach and I started significantly improving. During the lockdowns, I bought JD's book and continued alone by following his 5k-10k plans and improved even more. For the reference, I [50M] went from 26:56 to 22:40 (for 5k) in those 2 years.

I now joined a local club and they train on the track. They also have a coach who leads a very good group of youngsters and he also provides a training plan for us seniors. I really enjoy the track but I find out that my endurance is regressing while my speed is improving. This weekend I raced 10k and the wheels came off after 5k. I got completely broken and was nowhere near my planned 10k pace in the 2nd half of the race. Strangely enough, I managed to speed up significantly during the last 0.5 mile when it felt as if I was on the track :-).   

My problem is that I just got used to JD's terminology and I was really enjoying his T workouts. The new plan by the club's coach is full of workouts with all kinds of repeats at paces like 10k, or 5k, or 3k, or 80% of 10k etc. So, I can not really work out the correct pace and most likely I run workouts too fast. 
When it comes to the track workouts, I can hold paces really well and feel good after the workout but these paces are faster than JD's I and R paces. So, I am a bit lost and can not really understand the purpose of the workouts. Also, I have a feeling that track workouts build my speed, but my endurance suffers.

I enjoy the track and the people I run with, so I do not want to leave the club. Would it be OK if I run the track with the group and then run a familiar JD's T session as my second weekly workout?
Or trust the process and have faith in the new coach, but reduce my paces (if yes to this, how much slower do I go)?  
BTW, he spends his time coaching youngsters and I do not want to bother him (or maybe even insulting him) with my questions/doubts. He has been coaching for 20+years and had some really successful career, so I am pretty sure that he knows what is he talking about. However, I did notice that I am regressing.

## Training

After the 5000m race on May 15th started bit by bit transitioning to faster workouts. More 200m, 400m repeats. Only 3 weeks before the TT started doing more specific training for 1500m. 10x400m, 15x400m, and so on. But it wasn't a big preparation, and I don't have lots of speed training in me at all. We planned for 1:12 per lap.

## Race

Went out way too hard. First lap - 1:08. As I haven't run longer than 400m at this speed I started feeling that I've passed the 400m mark already. Or maybe it's my mind playing tricks on me. My second lap was 1:13, so still not bad. Then I slowed down miserably. My third lap was 1:17. It was 300m left so I started pushing again. I ran like I haven't run already 1200m. Kicked with \~150m left. If my first lap had been slower, I could've managed other laps better and with a kick run 28 high probably. Fell down on my knees after.

## Post-race

It went by pretty fast. It's pain, but not the same as 5k pain so it's hard to compare them. Now as I have a base time I can work on my speed and expect 4:20 in the near future. I'm happy with my time. Now through summer, I expect great progress.",1625064960

*History*

This workout is named after Australian Robert De Castella (Deek), previous marathon world record holder (2:07:51 PR and a win at Boston). 

https://www.podiumrunner.com/training/workout-of-the-week-deeks-quarters/

*What*

8x400 with 200m reps. Sounds easy right?

*How*

The 400’s are run at slightly faster than your current 5K race pace and the 200’s at a pace that’s about a minute per mile slower than your 5K pace. The point is that each rep gets harder and harder because you aren't giving yourself ample recovery.",1625059926
829,AdvancedRunning,darentheterran,Resting heart rate day after a hard workout,"Hi, I am 39y/o male 5-11 150. I do over &gt;90% of my runs at a very easy pace \~11min miles, and once a week do either a 3 mile tempo run at under 8min mile pace or 800m repeats at under 7min mile pace. I monitor my heartrate both while running and at rest. One thing i've consistently noticed with myself is that the day after a tempo run or 800m repeats my resting heartrate is lower than typical, but quickly recovers to where it used to be within 48 hours. The difference is sometimes &gt;5 beats/min. I've asked around as well as scoured the internet and this doesn't seem to be a common phenomenon. My own best guess is that this occurs because my cardiovascular system is still recovering, because of this i don't do anything, not even recovery run, on days immediately after a hard session.

Does the above happen to anyone else?",1625054540

832,AdvancedRunning,NotTheTrueKing,Is there an adjustment period for maximalist shoes?,"I've seen how much praise maximalist shoes have gotten over the years and after spending a long time being a hippie and avoiding them, I decided to jump on the trend by buying a pair of Hoka Clifton 7's. I'm generally a midfoot/light heel striker and pretty short, so I average 180 SPM at every pace and I've been running in pretty low stack shoes with flexible midsoles for the past few years (Boston 7's, Merrell's, etc.) so that might also be a factor, but I just can't help feeling awkward whenever I run in the Hokas. Mind you, it isn't the drop, because I feel supremely more secure with the lower drop, but it feels like my actual footstrike is off. I'm not overstriding, but at the same time I feel like I'm working 10x harder with way less feedback. I've done about 20 miles so far on them and I still haven't figured it out. Is there some kind of adjustment period I'm missing or something else about it that I've missed?",1625024257

834,AdvancedRunning,pussydissapointer,Let's talk marginal gains!,"Most of us know a majority of advice boils down to run smart, eat well, and sleep well. 

These three things are a majority of what even elite athletes need to worry about.

But I wanted to switch up the discussion to squeezing every last bit of performance. That's right, marginal gains!

I'm at a point in my life where I want to accomplish big things, and I'm fortunate enough to have a lot of time and energy to dedicate to running. 

So I'd love to hear some of your favorite marginal gains. What are minor adjustments you've made in your life that alone make a fraction of a difference, but when combined with other changes can make a large impact? A simple example would be polishing up your sleep routine to allow deeper sleep. (An eye mask, doing research on what sleeping position works best for you, setting the right temperature at night, and proper device usage) 

Alternatively, is there a giant resource you'd recommend for this? A trusted site that breaks down all topics that indirectly impact running. I'm a total geek and love optimizing everything :)",1625015054

I always see graphs of other people’s heart rates and they can maintain a steady rate - I can’t seem to do that, even if I take it easy on a run. Mine always ends up going up noticeably at a mile or so and I often spend 22-24 minutes of a 30 minute run in heart rate zone 4 of 5, even if I’m not trying to. 

Am I that out of shape, or should I take an even easier pace? For reference, my Max heart rate is about 200 and I average 180 in a 30 minute run.",1625008748
837,AdvancedRunning,westphillyghost,"For all the beginner runners dealing with heat, SLOW DOWN!","Hello all,

I’m hoping that putting some real numbers to some recent runs I’ve done will help show beginner or novice runners that summer heat can drastically alter their running efforts, paces and recovery

Background: 31M recreational runner for the past 16 years. I’ve done nothing earth shattering but I’ve been running long enough to have learned many lessons along the way. I’d say right now, I’m in about 5:15-5:30 mile shape and overall am a distance rather than a speed runner

Earlier this spring, I returned from a running break and started getting back into running shape. I regularly used a heart rate monitor (chest strap) to keep an eye on my running efforts in accordance with the days agenda. I regularly run 35-45mpw and my easy paces when the weather was cooler ranged from 7:20-7:40 depending on other factors. These paces were the average pace when my heart rate was between 140-160bpm. I usually like to keep around 150bpm for easy runs and 140 for recovery runs.

This past week has become full summertime where I’m at, with temp ranges of 90-95F and 50% humidity on average. I sometimes have the option of running later at night around 8pm but don’t really have an option to run early as I work early as an RN. 

Such as it is, I decided to do a few runs this week on my days off when it was 90+ degrees out to start some heat acclimatization. The average pace I’m able to keep while keeping my heart rate at an easy effort was 8:35min/mile!

This usually feels like a slow, recovery effort for me but alas, it feels way different now

I figured I would throw out some real numbers for those wondering just how much you have to slow down in the summer. Hopefully this is helpful for a few people out there",1624999173
838,AdvancedRunning,runs-and-eats,Big cedar lodge running trail,I’m planning a trip to Big Cedar Lodge in MO. I’ll be there during an 18 mile training run. Anyone have any great non-technical runs to recommend in the Table Rock Lake area? I’ve never been around there and I’d like to have a plan in place before departing. Thanks!,1624996559
839,AdvancedRunning,vsbuffalo,Running changed my life... but how do I keep doing it for the next few decades?,"I'm a 34M that started running for real (after lots of starts and stops) in January. For the first time, I'm really addicted and it's sticking (and doing runs ≥5 miles was largely the reason why). Running 15-20 miles a week has completely stopped migraines I've had for 20 years that would require medication, I've lost 14lbs, my fitness is now much higher, so needless to say, it's the most important step I've taken for my physical and mental health.... ever. 

My main concern is that my knees will prevent me from running over the next decades of my life. I have had a right patellar dislocation in the past, and hit by a car while biking on the other knee (but this was minor and PT helped) — honestly, I think chronic sitting contributed more to my knee issues than these injuries. Anxiety around knee pain has kept me wary of running in the past, but stepping up the mileage 10% / week has actually made my knees \*stronger\* through time. I still get random, temporary bouts of pain during a run (especially during warmup) that usually go away after a few meters. For full context, I've found my left hamstring is chronically tighter than the right (e.g. with dynamic stretch kicks, I can never raise it as high), and stretch my hamstrings in a doorframe and stretch quads usually helps with the pain.

I've read studies saying that running being bad for knees is a myth (being sedentary is worse), but (1) when should I be concerned, and (2) what are the top strength training or stretches I must do to maintain healthy knees for running over the next few decades? Happy to answer more questions, and thank you!",1624991654

841,AdvancedRunning,NotTheTrueKing,Constant feeling that I'm overstriding even though form/cadence says otherwise,"Hey y'all. I've been coming back to regular running after a year or so off. Before this, I was a pretty regular runner for the past 6 years and, while running was painful, I didn't ever really feel like my body was out of sync or something. However, since starting up again recently, I've had this constant feeling like I'm overstriding and having to pull my body forwards, especially later in runs when my form gets worse and I start to lose my lean. At the same time, my cadence is a constant 180-190 SPM regardless of pace and I seem to be landing relatively above my center of gravity. This effect is especially pronounced in shoes with higher drops (8-10 mm), which are coincidentally the main types I've been running in since 2018. I don't feel this as much in the one zero drop shoe I own, but I can't help but think it's a placebo since I tend to run slower in those as well. Could this feeling actually be attributable to something like shoe drop or has anyone experienced something similar?",1624965626

843,AdvancedRunning,the-cathedral-,What are some great US destinations for running?,"I'm looking to book a monthlong trip in August and want to stay somewhere with a lot of beautiful running trails. Boulder would be perfect but it's a tad out of my price range. Same goes with Rocky Mountain National Parks (Grand Lake and Estes Park areas). Outside of US, I considered Costa Rica but running there might be too humid for a month.

Any thoughts on places like Boulder where there are tons of trails nearby?",1624928949
844,AdvancedRunning,theotherwhitehead,No love for Phil Maffetone? (Simple calculation to see if MAF is right for you).,"I ran a search on this sub/forum for “Phil Maffetone” and the “MAF method.” What I found is that many athletes dismiss this method because, among other reasons, they worry that they are training too slowly. There is a simple calculation to determine for yourself if you would benefit from spending some time running “too slowly.”

MAF, Philip Maffetone alleges, stands for Maximum Aerobic Function. (It just happens to correspond to the first three letters of his last name.)

 In short, the MAF method is a heartrate monitoring training approach that emphasizes running at an intensity level that is approximately between 78-83% of maximum heartrate (my estimates). Rather than ask athletes to conduct demanding HR-max tests and perform tedious calculations, Maffetone has offered a simple guide: subtract your age from 180 and voila: your ceiling for MAF. For example, as a 35yo, 180-35=145 beats per minute. Maffetone would advise me to keep the majority of my runs between 135-145 bpm. (There are small adjustments that can be made based on fitness and health. I am healthy and have averaged 50mpw for 12 years, so I add 5 beats per minute. My new ceiling is 150 bpm; my adjusted range is 140-150).

Many athletes find that this intensity level (78-83% HRmax) corresponds with a pace that seems too slow (the author of this post finds it a bit fast; more on this below). Maffetone (and other coaches who emphasize aerobic conditioning) argue that there are gains to be had at this (allegedly) low intensity. Indeed, if this intensity level seems awkwardly slow to an athlete, then said athlete likely stands to gain much from training at MAF. (If you think MAF is slow, be advised that John “Hadd” Walsh, by comparison, recommends the majority of training be spent at 70-75%HRmax, and twice-weekly workbouts in the 83-88% range.)

There is a simple test to see if an athlete would benefit from binging on MAF exercise (i.e., spending 4-6 months training within the MAF zone). Compare your IAAF scores across race distances. Thankfully, there is a calculator that will do this for you (so you don’t have to scroll through thousands of pages of spreadsheets to find your scores). https://caltaf.com/pointscalc/calc.html
Here are my values:

Distance	         Time		IAAF score
Mile:		          4:44		602
5K (road): 	15:49		666
10K (road):	33:50		656
15K (road):	51:10		701
Half marathon:1:13:10	        705

Notice how my IAAF scores get larger as the race distance increases. (I am a classic slow-twitch runner.) Looking at my training, you would (rightly) say that I would benefit from anaerobic intervals OR faster training runs, depending on which race time I wanted to improve (middle distance or 25K+). Since I have been following the Hadd method (which advocates running even slower than MAF for the majority of runs), then switching to MAF means increasing the my intensity across the board, and (hopefully) improving my shorter distances. Notice: following MAF has my running faster than usual, not slower.

If, when you run your IAAF numbers, the value gets lower as the race distance increases, then this means that you have poor aerobic training. If this is the case, then you would benefit from spending time at MAF (or even slower, in the author’s opinion). If your IAAF numbers get bigger as the race distance increases, then you can increase the intensity of your workouts/easy runs.

You will see from the numbers above that I am not slow. I’m not racing in the Olympic trials, but I win a lot of local races. When I compare my average training pace with my local running club, however, I am one of the slowest runners in the city. I run the majority of my miles at 70-75% HRM (which is about 10-15 bpm lower than the MAF number), and this corresponds to about 7:40 min/mile in the winter and 8:20 m/m in the summer. MAF, by comparison, is currently 6:25 in the winter and 6:45 in the summer. That’s generally too fast for a daily pace, but look at how weak my mile and 5K times are compared to my 15K and half marathon. I could probably benefit from increasing the pace of my easy runs (which I’m now doing) and adding more frequent strides.

I have more to say about how to maximize MAF (such as getting a quality HR-monitor strap), but will wait and first see the vitriol roused by this post.",1624904478

### Training
I'd been running a pretty consistent 35-40 mpw over the past year with no target races, just spinning my wheels in a general Daniels framework (similar to the 5-week marathon cycles plan) and waiting for an interesting in-person race to pop up. Decided to run the Blue Moon Trail Series (5k, 8k, 10k) on a lark about two weeks ahead of the first race. Despite no real prep or taper, took 6th overall with a 22:31 in the 5k, which I'm happy with. I know it's dumb to shoot for a finishing place, especially when it depends so much on few *actually* fast people showing up, but my goal was to do better in the 8k. After the 5k, kept my training mostly the same with 2 workouts (reps or intervals and a tempo) per week, easy runs, and weekend long runs. Mileage crept up to 45 mpw before a little race week taper.

### Pre-race
Got an email the week of the race saying trail maintenance forced the 8k to be rerouted. Might be more like an 8.5k now. No big deal, right? Weather was cooler than expected with a thunderstorm looming. That's evening in Colorado for you. Got a mile warmup in, some dynamic stretching, some strides, felt decent but not great. Wind felt a bit chilly as I lined up at the start, but I knew I'd be grateful for it once I started running. Race director reiterated that the course was well-marked and course marshals would be there to provide direction.

### Race
Felt strong as we set off toward the nasty first hill. Counted 5 people ahead of me with the rest of the pack pretty far back. Adrenaline kept me going up the hill without too much slowing, and I passed a guy on the downhill. By the end of the first mile I was in 5th place and entirely alone, with no chance at catching up with the front-runners and very comfortably ahead of everyone else. I focused on holding back a bit over the next two miles, since they had some wicked hills and I knew I'd have a couple miles to go after the climbs. Finished the 5k loop with some reserves intact and ready to attack the last 3k. Pace was a bit off for a sub-38 time, but I'd make it up with a fast finish. Course marshals pointed me toward the loop that finishes the 8k and I started picking up the pace.

Okay, there's the closed-off section of trail with signs pointing the way for the race re-route. Awesome. But then... a fork with no flags telling me which way to go. I went right. Wrong choice. Trail dumped me out in a neighborhood. Doubled back and almost got caught by the 6th-place dude, but I managed to put some distance between us once I was back on track. Oh look, there are some flags up ahead at another fork... but they don't actually tell me which path to take. Uh oh. Go left this time? 4th mile had clicked by now, and I was starting to see other runners. We were passing each other going the opposite direction, shrugging our shoulders and saying we're not sure where we're going. A couple other lost runners turned around and started following me. Hey look, more flags! And they're indicating we should turn around and go back the way we came? That's the consensus, so the three of us did it. Still hoping to save the race, I kept pace up a hill as the other two guys started to drop back... and then they were gone. Apparently they took a turn I didn't see. I was alone again, 5 miles into an 8k, with no idea where to go.

5.45 miles in, I stopped my watch in frustration. After walking for a bit, I found a trail marker and re-started my watch. Jogged for a mile before stopping my watch again. I was completely lost. And then... another runner! Older guy, walking. It turned out he was a bit injured, so I walked with him as a downpour started. We walked for another mile or so (according to his watch; I was too mad to turn mine back on, Garmin was *not* going to record the way this race finished!) until finding ourselves in familiar territory. Half a mile later, soaked and muddy, we made it to the finish as they were packing up.

### Post-race
The race director was very apologetic but too embarrassed to chat much. I was too cold and wet to hang around. Put some flip-flops on, hopped in my car, and picked up a burger on the way home. My shoes are still a bit damp. But hey, I ran an 8-mile 8k! I guess that's something not a lot of people can say.

847,AdvancedRunning,bearable_bears,Looking for advice for two marathons in one weekend.,"Hey all, I’m doing the i35 challenge in October which is the KC marathon followed by the Des Moines marathon the next day, and looking for advice from anyone who might have similar experiences.

I think I just have two topics I was needing advice on:
1) did you feel you needed a larger shoe the next day? I am definitely going to wear different shoes both days as I’m guessing the foam on one shoe will get pretty beat up on day one. But in ultra races they usually change out for a larger size half way through. Did you feel you needed increased room rather it be from swelling or black toenails?
2) any advice for those 12 or so hours in between? I think I might just live in recovery sandals during that time, maybe some compression socks?

848,AdvancedRunning,odinsson_88,Hamstring Rehab,"Hello wonderful community. This sub is a wealth of information and I am sad I just discovered it recently. 

Background - been running for about 10 years off and on with injuries but mostly consistent. Didn’t take it seriously until about 4 years ago. Done 18 in the 5K and 1:25 half. 

Issue - tore my right hamstring in October 2018 and strained the left as well. I feel like I have done everything. Got them both diagnosed immediately after. Was in months of PT (did all the exercises), even did PRP in both sometime early in 2019. I was able to eventually start running relatively pain free in 2020 and ran easy pace all year and even into early this year (3-4 runs a week - peaking at about 11-12 miles).  So, I felt like I was ready to go back to structured workouts, but my hamstring just flare up each time. 

Ask - has anyone gone through acute hamstring issues? It’s mind blowing to me that I still have discomfort almost three years later. I see a PT still (two actually for diverse opinions) and the answer is the same. Strengthening/change of mechanics etc. maybe I am realizing that I may not be able to add speed/workouts again and that makes me sad. 

Any insights on how to manage expectations or just hamstring issues would be appreciated.",1624891772
849,AdvancedRunning,Nation_Of_Moose,Supporting Professional Running Is Hard,"*This was inspired by a couple of articles and podcasts recently discussing various aspects of this issue as it pertains to pro running.*

I’m a fan of the mighty Reading FC, giants of the EFL Championship. I can shop on their online store to my heart's content, buying all kinds of merchandise - from all the official kits head to toe, to lamps and towels. I also follow professional road cycling, where I can buy three different version of the EF Nippo kit, from the skinsuit the team wears in time trials to a cheaper (still £80 for the top) top and bib shorts, as well as training kits if I don’t want to be wearing bright pink. Add in various accessories made by the team and their kit sponsor. Many teams also make the relevant national and region championship kits each season, as well as world champions kit (I’ll come back to this later).

But what about running? If you’re a fan of Bowerman Track Club or Tinman Elite (or whatever it’s now called when you read this) you’re in luck - [Bowerman especially](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/577ea8e5b3db2b9290ce0406/1622659294703-XFC5W095PD8KBK4NWKVK/Cortney+White-06624.jpg?format=750w) has a great range of merchandise on sale. Fan of another running group or team? Sorry. whilst a few of the top teams offer some level of merchandise, the vast majority do not.

Why does this really matter? Part of the beauty of running is that you don’t need many pieces of equipment, a team, a set pitch, a referee. You can just go and do it in almost all conditions. Running doesn’t require you to spend £100s on equipment just to get going (I won’t tell anyone about that pair of Vaporflys you have sat nearby). That is indeed true, but right now you’re on /r/AdvancedRunning, so clearly you care more about the sport, in addition to the personal fitness and wellbeing component. 

In addition to wanting to rep your favourite team or runners gear when you go for a run - in the same way you don the colours of your favourite football team on match day - there’s also a empathetic reason to care about how athletes earn a living wage. Athletics isn’t a sport that offers a life changing pay-day. There are no guaranteed contracts, no pension funds, in many cases there is very little money outside of prize money at races. Searching for runner gofundme’s and I can find athletes that have won medals for Team GB and Australia at events like the Commonwealth games looking for money to help with their training. This is for things like altitude camps, time away from their full time job, those additional bits of equipment that a member of BTC can access by going into one of many state of the art buildings on the Nike Campus, but that the vast majority cannot even begin to think about easy access to. 

So to summarise so far:

* Very few running groups or brands make professional kit or merchandise available to fans, which is something other sports have done well for decades now

* Many many elite runners barely scrape a living

What can be done then? What was the point of all these words? *(what I talk about below is blue-sky thinking, I’m not actually expecting anything, I’m just some guy on a rest day wanting to write about running)*

Professional runners, individuals or established training groups, should offer running fans more ways to support their running. Whether that be through the brands that sponsor the team directly, or enterprising team members producing merchandise independently. 

We’re starting to see more efforts to produce video and social content above and beyond what we witness at established races, so teams and individuals are clearly looking to grow their fanbases. This is great, but give us ways to actually financially support those runners. The Athlete Special and Allie Ostrander do a fantastic job of showing their lives with Brooks Beasts, but Brooks Beasts have no (easily locatable) merchandise. Give us fans an outlet to show our support with our wallets for individual runners and teams. 

We need more than the generic Nike Elite singlet, or a Team GB adidas vest every 4 years for the Olympics. One of my favourite runners is Jack Rayner, who runs for the Melbourne Track Club, probably the best distance running team in Australia. The team does not have its own kit, the few members sponsored by Nike wear the generic [Nike Elite kit](https://images.ctfassets.net/xqkpzhsplpg2/6wrggQzDfFi3znPEcZznQ/34d53124b958db5a0b2fb6ba43eacd4c/TMP_2033.jpg?w=1980&amp;fm=webp&amp;q=90), others wear plain kit. (The 5 athletes in that image are part of MTC) Given the team has the majority of the top Australian distance running talent, merchandise would surely be bought by the fans of the team and the individuals themselves, given the huge range of fans the members cultivate - from Stewart McSweyn taking on the Ingebrigtsons at the 1500m, to Sinead Diver, who works and is a mum whilst representing Australia in the marathon at 44 years old. The team is ever-present in the Australian running scene, so give fans a way to support those runners, not just the top few but the up-and-coming members of the team too.

Whilst I don’t expect giants like Nike to start making 20 different unique team kits, I think it would be fair to at least be able to make different colourways of that year’s singlet (Nike seem to be starting to do this to a degree) and a team logo. MTC might not be able to have custom kits in the same way BTC get from Nike, but a kit in Australian yellow and green with an MTC logo would surely be an improvement for the members of the team to race in, and something that fans would be more inclined to wear themselves.

Once teams and individuals start making merchandise available, I’d hope that this could be used as leverage to make changes to the kit rules. This is where we run in to World Athletics issues (as any problem in Athletics does).

4.2 in the World Athletics Marketing and Advertising Regulations states:

&gt; For the avoidance of doubt manufacturers and Athlete Sponsors can only have one brand name/Logo applied once on items of Athlete Kit or other apparel (as referenced in Clause 5.5) and personal belongings or accessories (as referenced in Clause 6) in accordance with these Regulations (i.e. they cannot have a name/Logo of one brand in one position on Athlete Kit, other apparel, personal belongings or accessories then a second different brand name/Logo in another position on Athlete Kit, other apparel, personal belongings or accessories or have the same name/Logo appear more than once items of Athlete Kit or other apparel, personal belongings or accessories). 

Athletes are limited to a single sponsor on their kit. Seb Coe, World Athletics president, had to be pressured to give up his 6-figure Nike ambassadorship when elected president of the then IAAF. Whilst these are not logos appearing on Seb’s suit, it seems somewhat hypocritical to preside over rules limiting the hugely limited income streams of the product (especially given athletes wear national kits at some of the biggest events) but have multiple revenue streams yourself whilst claiming to be impartial.

[Being a member of the House of Lords, Seb Coe has to declare his interets here.](https://members.parliament.uk/member/783/registeredinterests) 

(It’s also odd that energy drink sponsorship has to be approved (3.5.6) - presumably Mondo Dulantis has this approval - given the vast sums of money they pump in to other, far less popular sports. Maybe allowing this sponsorship stream would be of major benefit given the money and coverage brands like Red Bull provide their vast athlete pools.)

I’d like to see these rules changed. Purists will hate this change, and bemoan athletes becoming walking billboards - the irony being the outrage at an additional 5cm logo on an athlete’s singlet as they run by [numerous advertising banners raking in money for World Athletics](https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1178137872-640x360.jpg), the IOC and the event organisers (usually with the event taking place in a morally questionable location). One of the things that triathlon does well is [allowing athletes to cultivate their own sponsors](https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSC06209.jpg), running needs to let their stars have access to this income stream too.

My final blue-sky change I’d like to see comes directly from cycling. We need to celebrate World, Olympic and National champions better. In cycling disciplines administered by the UCI (equivalent to World Athletics), the World, Regional (Europe, Oceana etc) and National champions are permitted to wear special kit pertaining to that discipline - so the winner of the World Championship Time Trial will be allowed to wear the UCI World Champion jersey with the recognisable UCI stripes,[ as seen here worn by Filippo Ganna](https://www.swisscycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1300832175.jpg). Ganna can wear this only during TT events, during road races he wears his normal team kit - Julian Allaphille is the road race world champion currently. Past champions are also permitted to have a band on their sleeve with previous titles -[ Peter Sagan is currently Slovakian national champion, and as a previous world champion can wear the UCI stripes on his sleeve.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CysozLSqftnvEfkjMV4uMm-1200-80.jpg)

I’d love to see running embrace something like this. Celebration of current and previous champions adds to the prestige of the events, for fans and runners alike. If we were to implement my first and second ideas, sponsors would be more attracted to be seen on the world champions singlet or shorts, and merchandise related to the titles would surely benefit the athletes too. Allow World, Olympic and National champions to wear a special singlet or kit in their specific event, and have a mark on their singlet in the following years to denote their previous titles. [This is the traditional GB singlet](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profilepic.aspx?athleteid=2424) - it’d be great to see Eilish McColgan and Marc Scott with a special singlet like this for the next year in any 10000m races they do to indicate that they are British 10000m champions. 

Whilst I’m sure you’ll agree, disagree or have different ideas to the few I’ve discussed, fundamentally running and athletics are stuck and behind the times. I think we can all agree that in many areas, the sport of athletics has not progressed for many years in how new fans are attracted to the sport, kept interested, and able to put money in to the sport. Where I can watch an F1 race on a camera on a specific car, with the driver’s radio instead of the normal TV commentary, we’re still in a world where key parts of races are cut away from. After the F1 race is finished I can buy all kinds of merchandise from teams and drivers themselves. I also think any changes need to come from the top, middle and bottom. Fans and athletes have been shown time and time again that World Athletics care first and foremost about what makes them the most money, and usually this is not related to the actual events but on bribes and corporate sponsorships - this is where I’d love to see athletes and teams take the initiative and give us fans ways to support the athletes. Whilst gofundme’s serve a purpose I don’t feel that it’s a sustainable way for fans to support the athletes we seek entertainment and inspiration from. If athletes and teams do provide merchandise, vote with your wallets as they say. And wherever possible lobby those at the top to make changes to benefit the people we want to see performing, to allow them to do so without having to decide between barely scraping a living or giving up the sport entirely! 


What do you think? Would you buy more team kit if it was on offer? Do you also think World Athletics needs to have a serious overhaul of its structure and rules? Do you know other ways of supporting professional runners in a more direct fashion than buying shoes from Nike.com?",1624882203
850,AdvancedRunning,Nowitzkis,"Starting training for first marathon, questions regarding 16 week plan","Hello everyone,

I'm starting training for the Amsterdam Marathon which takes place on 17th October. First ever marathon for me.

Since last year I've been running regularly, increasing distance per run slowly, with current runs ranging anywhere between 12 to 16km 4-5 times per week. Last few weeks I've been feeling weight in legs, so to give some more recovery time I've reduced runs to 12km and only 4 per week. This helped and now every run feels fresh.

I decided to follow a marathon training plan for following 16 weeks, but the one I've chosen starts with short distance weeks rest-5-5-crosstraining-6-rest-8 schedule, which is far below my current mileage. In following 10 weeks it slowly climbs back to usual 11-13km midweek runs and long runs exceeding 25-30km.

Is it smart for me to drop distance so fast to follow training in first 5-8 weeks, or should I keep running my usual 12km until training schedule catches up and starts increasing mileage?

My goal is to have fresh legs and do more exercise outside training during the preparation weeks, so I would finish the marathon sub 4 hours (my half marathons that I ran myself were 1h.35 and 1h.39 min).

Thank you all!",1624873104

856,AdvancedRunning,eled34,NYC Marathon Goal Time,"Hi all,

I’ve been driving myself crazy trying to plot out a reasonable goal pace for the NYC Marathon this November.

I live in Austin, TX and am currently running 30-40 mpw in minimum 80-90 degree heat. My pace for shorter 3-5 mile runs is usually in the mid to low 8s, but can get to mid/high 7s if I push and longer runs (10-15mi+) tend to be closer to to 9:00, though I am intentionally backing off the pace a bit to avoid injury.

Im wondering if a 3:45 target is reasonable given the grueling heat I’ve been training in, not to mention some solid hills as well? 

I’m thinking I’ll settle in at 40-50mpw in the next month or two and ride that mileage out until the race in November, with weekly long runs in the 15-22 mile ballpark. 

I’m 26, 5’10 155, and I ran NYC in 4:45 in Nov 2018 and have run 3 other marathons independently since then, all at 4:30 or slower, though I’m discounting those results given the terrible hydration/conditions I put on myself. Also DNFd an Ironman in July 2019.

858,AdvancedRunning,Siawyn,Akron 8k - my JD experience,"Headed into 2021, I had no idea how the state of races would be this year.  I couldn't justify signing up for any major half marathon or marathons because who knows if they would be held, or go virtual, etc.  I decided this would be the perfect time to do what I never had the time for -- focus on a shorter race distance and try to build some speed, as this would speed up all my race paces in the long run.  After some consideration, it looked likely that the Akron 8k race would be held this June, and even if it didn't, time trialing an 8k isn't completely awful.

I settled on JD's 5k/10k 40-50 mile plan for this block.  I'd never done a JD plan before (I'm a Pfitz man) so I wanted to mix it up a bit and see if I would respond to a different stimulus.  It definitely looked challenging going in, but I was going to give it an honest shot.  I jumped right into Phase II as I already was running 40-50 mpw in the offseason, so I did not need the buildup.  The plan was for 13 weeks then - follow Phase II &amp; III as written, and then race the 8k at the end of week 1 for Phase IV.

Phase II in this plan has a fairly strong focus on R work. I got quite familiar with running 200's and 400's, sometimes after doing T work.  R pace was difficult at first for me, but after a few weeks I quickly got the hang of it for the most part, though 400s occasionally I found myself hanging on.  The layout was usually a pure R type workout on Tuesday, a R/T mixed workout on Friday, and then a 11-13 mile LR on Sunday.  Every other week, JD had the LR be M paced.  In retrospect, I'm not completely convinced this is an effective training stimulus for a short race.  I think he just doesn't want you to run your long runs too slow.. but if I did this again, I'd probably just run these at the fast end of my easy pace, or maybe stitch in a brief T section in the middle.   Still, I got though Phase II just fine with the 3Q schedule.  One thing I did learn after 2 weeks was R workouts I really did need the standing/walking rest inbetween, otherwise the equal distance rest meant my form quickly broke down because I wasn't getting enough time between reps.  Once I made that adjustment, I found 200s a lot snappier.

Phase III was when he pivoted to back to back workouts, set up on Wednesday/Thursday for me.  The Wednesday session was some flavor of an I/H workout, usually around 5000m worth. The Thursday workout would be a T session, somewhere between 3-5 miles.  Usually this would be 4 or 5x 1 mile with about 90 sec rest between, following the 5:1 work/rest ratio he prescribes, though he did have a few 3 mile continuous T runs in there.  I really got into the rhythm of these.  I work, however, I struggled a bit with at times. I mostly hit the paces, but the longer I reps (1200m) were difficult for me to hit 6:30/mile pace or below.  JD also continued with the every other week Sunday M pace runs, which I continued to do to follow the plan.  About 4 weeks into Phase III I started to feel the fatigue a little bit finally, and I skipped the last M run, electing to just run easy instead.  The next week I got vaccinated, and I took this week completely easy.  I felt a little lethargic and tired as well.  But the next week (week 11) I had no problems getting back to workout speeds.

I ran every single day this cycle, continuing a streak that is up to 117 days now.  I've found it pretty beneficial, even if I'm feeling tired -- being older I might feel really creaky at the start of the run but I almost always feel better at the end of a 4 mile jog.

Paces -- it was interesting to compare my paces at the start of the cycle, and after.

* R:  200/400s were originally run at 46/92.  By the end I was seeing 42/43 for the 200s.
* I:  This one I didn't see much noticable improvement.  I mostly hung around 6:30/mile pace for 800-1200m reps. 
* T:  I saw a marked improvement here. I started off around 7:05/mile for T.  By the end of the cycle I was running these in the mid 6:5X range, and even had a rep or two that dipped under 6:50.  The 3 mile continuous T was even below 7 for all 3 miles.
* M:  I also saw improvement here.  The first M session saw me at 7:32/mile.  By the last one, this was down to 7:25/mile.

Overall I was very happy with how this cycle went - my consistency was stellar and the improvement was clear to see in retrospect.  I was running T miles at paces that just 2 years ago would have been faster than my 5k PR at the time.  The M pace miles are at a pace that would see me comfortably BQ. (roughly 3:15 marathon time; my BQ time needed when I give it a go next year is 3:25)  I got better at my 200s, learning to focus on cadence/turnover.   

What went wrong?  Not much.  I skipped one week for a recovery week - but honestly, looking at this now, I think it's important to build several recovery weeks in there.  I didn't do strides as much as he wanted - I was already doing 3Q and I really needed to keep it easy on those other days for the most part.

**Akron 8K race report**

I've run this race since 2017.  It is a tough course - about 250 feet of elevation with a fair amount of it on the back half.  You can see the elevation profile here:  https://imgur.com/a/k1Jvn4u  This isn't a race you negative split.  My goal going in was to get sub 35.  My T paces indicated that getting low 34 was realistic, but that would be for a flat course, which this is not.  My other goal was to get top 3 in my age group, which I thought I might have a shot at, given prior year race results.  It just depended who showed up.

What I couldn't control is the weather.  The forecast kept inching hotter, and race morning dawned really warm, humid and breezy.  The temp failed to drop below the mid 70s all night long.  But.. everyone has to deal with it.  I was hoping for a little race day magic, and I have to admit, it was a little inspirational to actually be running a real race again for the first time in a long time.  I lined up reasonably close to the start given my expected finish time, and off we went at 7:30 am.

**Mile 1:**

This starts off downhill, then we do 2 turns and head right back uphill on a parallel street.  I actually got a little boxed in here on the downhill part and didn't run it as fast as I'd hoped.  Headed back uphill it thinned out somewhat, and I was able to split a 6:57 mile.  So far, so good.

**Mile 2:**

This is what I call the ""banking time"" mile.  We climb about 30 more feet, then make a turn toward downtown Akron, losing a lot of elevation (~100 feet) in the process.  My pace slipped a bit on the uphill section, but once we leveled off and started the downhill, I was able to pick it up pretty good as downhill running is one of my strengths. It showed as I passed a few people here.  The very last part of the downhill I was running about 5:30 pace.  Overall split the mile in 6:47.  So far, so good.

**Mile 3:**

As this mile started we made a left turn onto Main street in downtown Akron and headed south for a mile.  As I made the turn, I was greeted with a roar, as the 15-25 mph south wind was funneling through the buildings.  It wasn't continuous, but it was gusty and quite strong at times.  The mile was net flat, but the last part we were starting to make a gradual climb out of downtown. The wind really ground me down toward the end of this section and I just wanted to get away from it and hopefully regroup.  Ended up splitting this one in 7:07.  Still overall below a 7 pace.

**Mile 4:** 

Thankfully we turned away from the wind and headed back toward the finish line... but there was a lot of up and down here.  I did fine when it was flat or downhill, but I just had nothing for the uphills any longer.  Ended up splitting 7:22 for this mile and knew that my sub 35 goal was long gone now.

**Mile 5:**

But what was worse, was this mile had the longest climb of them all, about a 75 foot climb over a half mile as we approached the stadium where we'd finish.  I dug in for this one and grinded it out, but it wasn't fast.  I knew I'd slow down, and I needed more banked time which I didn't have.  But the news wasn't completely morose.  Once I crested the climb I was able to regain pace, and as we made 2 more turns by the stadium the last quarter mile or so would be mostly downhill.  I saw a blonde woman about 100m ahead of me at this point who had passed me about a mile prior.  I made it my target to reel her in, and just opened my stride up and focused on a higher cadence, harkening back to all those 200s I did.  As I made the final turn into the stadium itself she was within catching distance, and as we made the last right turn onto the field I blew past her and on the way to the finish line.   Ended up splitting 7:19 for this mile.  But for that last part I ran it in sub 5/mile pace.  Thanks, JD!

Final chip time was 35:54.  Last time I ran this race in 2019, I had ran it in 39:32.  So needless to say, a pretty big course PR for me.

**Afterwards:**

I have to admit, I was really disappointed afterwards... but that was just the adrenaline wearing off I think.  This is a tough course, and the weather conditions were unseasonable.  In fact, the winds were crazy strong for summer, and the funneling effect through downtown was just brutal.  When I look at my HR, I was in the same range or slightly above where I was at during my T workouts, so the effort was at the appropriate level.  Finally, when I woke up this morning I was definitely more sore than at any time during the plan (even the back to back workouts) so I know I gave it a full effort.  I gave it my all, and honestly at the end that's all you can do - sometimes the weather will conspire against you.

When I use the temp/dewpoint conversion chart at http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html it suggests that my time was adjusted by about 3%.  Take that 35:54 and it converts to 34:51.  Throw in the hilly course compared to my flat T workouts and I think I did fine.

Ultimately I didn't finish top 3 in my AG though.  I ended up 5/50 there, and 75/1390 overall.  Couple of fast 45 &amp; 46 year old men showed up, whippersnappers.

**Final thoughts:**

I enjoyed the plan, and I responded very well to it.  I think I'd use it again.  In the big picture, it is clear as day that I improved throughout the plan, and summer races and hilly courses are always going to mess with projected goal times.  The fact that I'm now running T miles that start with a 6 is still a little frightening to me at times.

What's next?  Going to run a 5k soon and see if I can set a PR there.  Other than that, I'll take July and August mostly easy and do another mileage build.  Then I'll settle in for another 12 week training cycle for the HM I run every year in early November.  After that, spring 2022 will see me training up for Grandma's in June for my BQ attempt.",1624812719

It has to be a race and not just a training run. If no races are available, a TT is acceptable. You only get credit for the specific distance you're racing. This is a lifetime goal so no time limit other than getting old. I have the middle pretty well set, except for a few that need improving. I think maybe I'll save the 100M for last just because it seems like a more momentous way to finish this off. Are there any distances I'm missing? I know there are some odd distance ultras, but I think I've covered the standards. I suppose an argument could be made for 20k and 25k, so if I can find a race for those I'll throw them in too. 

100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, **1M**/1600/1500, **2M**/3200/3000, **5k**/3M, 8k/**5M**, **10k**, **15k**, **10M**, **Half Marathon**, **Marathon**, **50k**, **50M**, 100k, 100M

I've bolded  the ones I've completed. I group the metric equivalent as the same race. I might change the time goals to be an age graded percentage, VDOT, or finishing place e.g. top 10 in age group, but for now I have a pretty good sense of what I consider personally respectable.",1624735301

870,AdvancedRunning,paulgrav,How many gels do I need on my first marathon?,"How should I fuel my first marathon?

Bit of background first. I’m mainly a cyclist. I know how to fuel long rides, and I know which products work for me. With over 4 years of structured training and racing I’ve discovered that my anaerobic capacity is high. So I’m pretty confident I have a high proportion of type II muscle fibres, I’m guessing this applies to running too. This means that I’m good during short punchy rides, and less good at long and steady rides/races. This also means that I need more carbs than others do when on long rides.

I weigh 69kg and my VO2 is ~60. I think my kcal burn is ~70kcal per km. I’m guessing my glycogen stores are around 2000kcals. This would imply that I need 2940kcal to complete the marathon. Without fuelling I would have a deficit of 940kcals. Now, if I’m running at 70% of VO2 for the duration of the marathon, would that suggest that my body is fuelling itself from a ~[60:40 carb/fat ratio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000960#s2)? Let’s say I burn more carbs than expected, maybe the ratio for me is 70:30. Does this mean that, of the 2940kcals required, 2000kcals would come from glycolisis and 940kcals would come from lipolysis?

My question is, with a 940kcal deficit, how many gels (100kcals per gel) do I need to make up for that deficit? If lipolysis is as high as 40%, then I don’t need to fuel? Feels a bit risky. If it’s 30% then maybe I need 3 gels, just incase. Or just assume no lipolysis and consume 940kcals of gels (probably 10) during the course of the marathon. This feels risky from gastro point of view.

Any advice would be welcome.

P.S. I don’t intend on running with water bottles filed with carbs. That’s presents a whole other bunch of problems that I don’t have the inclination to solve.",1624704563

872,AdvancedRunning,1tsmillertime206,How fast could I get ready to PR at another marathon?,"I ran my first marathon in mid-May in 2:56 with hopes of running in Boston in April 2022. With speculation about Boston cutoff times being somewhat harsh, and with the knowledge that I should probably be training for something between now and Boston 2022, I was hoping to squeeze another marathon in between now and the end of the qualifying window (which ends November 12th), with a goal of sub 2:50. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been running seriously for several years now (I hit 70mpw peak during my last marathon training cycle). I took something like 2 and a half weeks completely off after my race in May and have since gotten 3 weeks of 25-30mpw on all easy running. I feel good, but am a bit worried about getting in shape in time for a race before the qualifying window closes. My main concern is building a solid base in time to get enough workouts in, since I'm somewhat injury prone if I build miles too quickly. I've looked around for BQ marathons in my area around October/early November, and while some haven't set dates yet it looks like my worst case scenario (i.e. earliest) option would be October 3rd, which leaves about 14 weeks between now and then. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, is 14 weeks enough time for me to build base and get marathon-ready? How many weeks of workouts do you think I'd need to get into 2:50 shape? 

Can anyone recommend any short training plans for a runner at my level? I was thinking about trying to modify a Daniels 2Q plan to be done in a shorter number of weeks. Bad idea? Looking forward to reading anyone's thoughts/discussion below. Thanks!",1624660641

### Training &amp; Background
I ran for the University of Nebraska and graduated in 2018. I took a couple months off training then started training for [Ironman Wisconsin 2019](https://www.strava.com/activities/2693578801). Once that was completed I self coached myself for a few months until I joined a DWRunning, local club with coaching and a good group of sub-elite runners in February 2020. Since almost all races were canceled last year, our club put together some time trials just to get some semblance of competition during 2020. After that season of racing I took a week off then dealt with a shinjury for a little bit of the winter. Once I got that corrected (turns out my cadence was too low), I started really diving into my first marathon cycle block. 

Previous to this year I had only done 3 training runs of 20+ miles and had at least a year in between each. During this cycle, I had 20+ mile long runs become normalized to me. I did 13 long runs of 20-24 miles this year, with too many of them in the single digit (or lower) temps of Chicago. The results paid off and I pushed the wall back in my mind of what a ""long"" run is. Now an 18 miler almost feels short which is crazy! On mondays I would do a medium long run of 12-14 miles to build up time on the feet. I was averaging mid 80 mile weeks during peak mileage, with the absolute top coming as a 90 mile week, with almost all of it coming from singles. The only double I would do is a 4 mile evening run after Wednesdays workout. For Wednesday workouts, it was a variety of workouts that had a lot of tempo and strength work, sometimes 3,2,2 mile tempo work, 8 mile tempos, 10mile progression, 10x1k, long fartlek work. All of which culminated in a [19 mile race simulation](https://www.strava.com/activities/5371845448) with 2 training partners from my club. This was the biggest confidence booster I had, we averaged 5:36 pace for 19 miles straight, 5:33 pace if you take out the first 3. I was excited with how good I felt on this and had high hopes for grandmas marathon. Technically my only other marathon was during the ironman triathlon where I ran a 3:12 so I knew I was set for a massive PR.

### Other races

Some other races I did last year and during the build up this year for grandmas:

[A somewhat disappointing humid&amp;hilly Lincoln HM in early May](https://www.strava.com/activities/5230343714)


### Pre-race

Going into the race the plan was to go out like we did in the race simulation. I had the same 2 people from my club plus 2 more people that went to Nebraska with me all planning to pack up. Based on the race sim, we all wanted to shoot for a sub 2:26 with a negative split. The plan was to start out in the 5:40s for the first 3 miles then work our way from high to low 5:30s for the next 13-16 miles. After that we would see how we felt then pick it up if we felt good or maintain if we didn't. Grandmas marathon had been stressing the point about their rolling start, they would have 6 lanes at the starting line where they would let runners go off every 5 seconds in groups of 6. They also said there will be no warming up and gave the vibe that basically once you get off the bus, you will be put in your lane and wait for your start. Because of this, all 5 of us planning to pack up met beforehand at the same bus so we could ride together and take the first possible bus. Unfortunately, 1 guy forgot his bib in his car and had to run back to grab it, missing our bus but luckily was able to find us not too long after we got off the bus. 

It turned out that much of what they had planned sort of went in the garbage due to the vaccine rollout happening faster than they thought. People got off the bus and were warming up around the car dealership and parking lot, bunching up at the start, etc. We got in our group and did a short warmup and dynamics. The temp was right at 60, partly sunny and would remain at 60 for most of the race. With about 15 minutes to go we started working out way up to the front, there was a separate elite start so we knew that out of the non elites, we'd be among the fastest and didn't want to start too far back especially with the 5s starting groups. A little excitement was in the air as the elite group, which was just 20m or so ahead of us, had Alan Webb (national US mile record holder) in it. We all joked that it should be our only goal to beat him in the race. We got to near the front of the starting lane (1 guy we passed got mad and told us we should start in the back, he was going for a 3hr marathon) and had about 10 minutes for the gun to go off. National anthem, jets flew overhead, and the gun went off

### Race

Miles 0-3

The whole 6 runners every 5 seconds instantly was discarded by the volunteers and runners. as soon as the gun went off, the volunteers cleared out and made no attempt to have us go every few seconds and it was essentially a mass start. Our pack went out and started hitting the miles we planned for. 5:47 5:41 5:41. By this point we were in a larger group of about 20

Miles 3-16

We settled into our 5:30s. Our next 13 miles would be 5:35, 5:36, 5:34, 5:36, 5:39, 5:38, 5:30, 5:39, 5:36, 5:34, 5:32, 5:37, 5:33. We were hitting them off like clockwork, had some light conversations with other runners, and some of the miles just seemed to melt away without any effort. We caught up to Alan Webb at around mile 13 and passed him, he had gone out too hard but it gave everyone a little boost to be passing him. I had been taking water at every aid station which was every 2 miles and had taken a Huma gel before 7 and 13. At around mile 14 our group had shrunk to about 10, us 5 were still together, plus the womens leader, plus a few others. My coach had told me not to make a break from my teammates early on, we wanted to stick together for as long as possible. But I could tell going into 15 that some guys were faltering, it was the first time in the race I was leading the pack and people were starting to come off even though I was maintaining the same pace. then we hit the mile 15 aid station and the pack exploded. In the carnage, it was just myself and my friend from Nebraksa now in front, the womens leader a couple meters behind, then everyone else strung out behind us. My friend and I decided that we both felt good and wanted to keep hitting low 5:30s for the time being.

Miles 17-29

Here is where it started to go wrong. At the end of mile 16 my left calf started threatening to cramp up. After a couple hundred meters I realized that this wasn't going to go away. I told my friend that he should just keep his pace if I fall off. The next 3 miles were 5:39, 5:43, 5:38. My calf was still threatening to cramp but I managed to almost hold onto the pace I wanted. I took another gel soon after the cramp started and started taking as much water &amp; powerade as I could to try and go into full damage control. My buddy and the womens leader slipped ahead of me as I tried to maintain pace as well as I could but I was also trying to shorten my strides as I was afraid if I took a full step my calf would completely seize up. Physically, I still felt great, like I could keep running mid 5:30s forever if only my calf just stopped cramping up so it was frustrating to force myself to slow down.

Miles 20-26.2

Around mile 20 I lost touch completely with my friend and was in pain, in no mans land. I'm not sure if it was partly race fatigue or only my calf that slowed me down, but I slowed down. The next 3 I averaged about a 5:50 mile but I was still catching people, a decent amount of folks who bonked and even some of the elites were coming back to me despite my slower pace. I still hoped that I could scrape together a sub 2:30 marathon. Then I hit Lemon drop hill. Its the hill of the race that everyone talks about. If it were in mile 3 I probably wouldn't pay much attention to it and it likely wouldn't affect my race. But starting up it at the beginning of mile 23 with a bum calf is a different story. The hill is over a half mile long and killed my pace to a point that I could never return to sub 6s. From the hill on, my last 4 miles were low 6s. I kept trying to do mental math for sub 2:30 and taking as much fluids as possible to the point where some of it came back up while I was passing someone. That painted a funny mental picture in my head, imagining myself as the other runner, you are 24 miles deep into a marathon when someone catches up to you, starts throwing up while continuing to run, then continues past you. I must've looked deranged. I shuffled through the last few miles, trying to keep some semblance of pace, then crossed the line with a 2:31:14



### Post-race
I limped around past the finish line for a bit, talking to my friends as they came in. We started to walk out of the finish area when my right calf completely seized up and I went down to the ground in pain. While down there, my left calf also seized up and you could see every single muscle and tendon in my leg. As I was lying on the ground in agony screaming profanities, a volunteer asked if I wanted to go to the med tent. She seemed to read my wincing as yes and they had to wheel to to the tent. While a med staff was stretching my calves, my right quad also started to seize up, fun! I got let loose after getting stretched out and getting electrolytes, met up with my friends, and we limped to the car to get back to our place. We spent the day and night in downtown Duluth drinking away the soreness, deduced since Webb had beaten Kipchoge in a 1500 in 2005 that our Kipchoge Number was down to 1, all in all a fun day. None of us could walk down stairs for a couple days after and it wasn't til about 5 days after that my legs started to feel less sore again. Reflecting on the race, I'm not too disappointed. I couldn't have foreseen that my calf would cramp up and I felt really great right before it did so that gives me confidence that I may have continued on my path to a negative split otherwise. Up next is some shorter distance races and a build up to the Chicago full to give this marathon thing another crack.

880,AdvancedRunning,Tea-reps,Any injury-prone runners here managed a Boston Qualifier while running &lt;50mpw?,"  So, I’m about to start training for what I’m hoping will be a 3h20-3h25 marathon in mid-October (I’m 27F). Going by my 5k and HM times (19m20s and 1h30m respectively), that should be pretty achievable, but all I’ve ever heard and read is that it’s mpw over multiple seasons that really matters for the marathon, which I don’t have.

For the last two years I’ve been running pretty low volume, 20-30mpw (running 3-4 days + cross training/strength work 3-4 days). I was running higher mileage (35-40) before that, but switched some of it out for cross training after developing runner’s knee. The lower base has been sufficient for me to get decent times in non-marathon races—I got both my 5K and HM times in 2019, and didn’t run over 30mpw that year. 

I would *love* to qualify for Boston, but I’m nervous I won’t make it from my current volume. I’ve already had a rocky start—I had to take 10 days off running after another flare up of runner’s knee while I was trying to bring my base back up to the 35-40 (I definitely didn’t take it slow enough, though, so that’s entirely my fault). I’ve been running pain free this week, and am about to start a 16-week plan that I’m adapting from Daniels’ 2Q model. I guess I *might* be able to make it up to 50mpw by week 11 or 12, depending on how I feel. But given I’m injury prone, I’m anticipating that 45 would be a safer peak for me in the time frame. The last time I trained for a marathon was in my final year of uni—I was running 55 at that time, but developed a stress fracture in my shin and had to pull out 2 weeks before the race. And I had a coach and team for support back then, while this time I’m on my own.

Anyone have any advice? Or also did lower mileage + cross training and still ran a strong marathon? I’m having real trouble goal-setting given my volume and race times indicate different things about my capacity.

(For reference, my long runs over the past year or so have been in the 10-13 range, and I can run them v comfortably at my goal marathon pace—7’40—often doing the last few miles at tempo—7ish—for fun. My other runs are usually some combination of a 40-60min fartlek, a 5-7 mile tempo run, and a 4-5 mile easy run. My cross training is usually elliptical and cycling, vigorous effort, plus swimming/hiking, which I consider easy/recovery.)

884,AdvancedRunning,Toadgunner,Finding USATF Certified Courses?,"So I am fairly new to advanced running and I plan to make a go for Boston in the 2022 Houston Marathon.  I have not had any recent races to show a qualifying time for a front corral position.  However, I can use a 10K result from a USATF certified course, I am thinking of using the RunHouston Race in September.  Only problem is I cannot figure out (despite my best google efforts) how to find out what events near me are USATF qualified. I also explored the USATF website with no luck. I am sure this is stupid simple and I am missing something easy.   Can anyone help me figure out how to tell if a course is a USATF qualified course?  Hope this is a worthy question for the group. I checked the side bar 1st.

I need to find a USATF qualified 10K to get a front corral spot in the Houston Marathon.  How do I know if a race/course is USATF qualified? Is there a list of USATF qualified courses somewhere?  Thanks in advanced for the help!",1624501342

Finally getting around to writing this report and despite it being more than 3 days after the race my legs are still shot.  I still need the clutch the railing going up/down stairs and can’t do a squat.  Also lost a golf-ball size piece of skin from my left heel (due to rock in shoe starting around mile 4), while the upper part of that foot hurts, and ankle remains swollen.  As a result really hoping I can get back to mild jogging tomorrow.
### Training
The last time I raced was in March 2020 so was pretty amped to get this marathon on my calendar.  Going in I was finally starting to get healthy after dealing with a tibia stress fracture and various Achilles &amp; knee issues.  Completed all 18 weeks of a Pfitz program peaking at 108 mpw.  There was one week where I skipped my long run but added a couple of miles here and there so all-in I only ran 10 miles fewer than prescribed.
One thing I did notice was not being able to hit tempo paces as well as guess was banking on “race day magic” where I ended up running an avg MP better than any I’d hit during the training build.  The course definitely took that away though I wonder if it’s less likely for one to exceed his/her training threshold the further up the learning curve they get.
My goal pace was 6:06 while the last workout I did still felt pretty smooth running 6:03 pace for a 5km with no warmup during the beginning of final taper week.


### Pre-race
Had to come back here to read prior race reports to confirm things I’d done previously.  Woke up at 3am for the 5:15am gun and had a small breakfast of clif bar, banana, and one date.  Also drank half a cup of coffee and sipped water.  Took a gel 20min prior to the start and was able to hit the bathroom just before this as well.  
The day before I tried to exert myself as little as possible minus a 4mi shakeout and focused on a large, carb-heavy lunch, with lighter dinner of pasta and salad.

### Race
Before I get into my race will provide a brief outline of the course profile.  The race starts at 8.8k ft elevation in Lamoille Canyon and the 1st half is running down the canyon into Lamoille which is at 6k ft elevation.  The following was taken from one of the only reviews of the course I could find online, and in hindsight I should’ve paid more attention to it:
“- For marathoners, you pass the finish at the halfway point and head out for a 13.1 figure 8 which is very very hard. The out and back consisting of miles 18-22 contains around 6 uphills and the 6 corresponding downhills that you will be walking, unless you are an elite runner. After this tough out and back, miles 22-25 seemed slightly uphill. All the runners I know paced over 2 minutes/mile slower in the 2nd half than the 1st.
- The first 2/10ths of a mile were a uphill loop at ~9k ft. I had trouble breathing here and only felt normal again around mile 2.5. If I had it over again, I would have walked the first part.
- 3000+ feet of downhill running in the first half seems a lot, but it seemed gradual enough and didn't do too much quad damage. there were about 3 small uphills in the first half, but nothing to worry about.”

As seen by my splits I was flying down the canyon and ended up being way too reckless.  I guess the adrenaline and excitement got to me as I wanted to pace with the defending winner of this race, who also runs XC for the University of Nevada.  He said before the race he was aiming for sub-2:40, having won it the year before in 2:49.  I don’t know how things would’ve played out if I didn’t take the lead early on, but despite the massive eventual blow-up probably still feel better than if I had let him fly past and didn’t have what it took to catch up.
We matched each other stride for stride the first uphill segment though I do remember slightly heavy breathing during this while the winner seemed fine.  I actually separated from him after ~1/2 mile and kept the lead until mile 14, where he passed me looking extremely smooth.  Not only was I hurting massively by that point, but him passing with such ease really broke some of my mental resolve.
Throughout the downhill I noticed I was going too fast to even properly stop for water/electrolytes and got a nagging rock under my heel which I should’ve stopped to get out.  I also had 2 mile splits around OTQ pace which should’ve been a huge red flag.  Ended up running a HM PR of 1:16, though I’ll have to race a flat course one day to get the real translation vs a downhill course at elevation that assisted heavily but also shredded my legs.
After I was passed in the valley the goal soon became just hold on enough to PR for the full.  That was much harder than it looked, however, as I soon became discouraged by seeing 7s, then 8s, finally 9s on my watch.  I forget at what point I stopped looking at mile splits but the goal then shifted again to just finish.  I’ve suffered toward the end of runs before but this was brutal and looking back I’m actually more proud of this performance than my PR race (which was over 23min faster) by virtue of just not stopping and giving up.
There wasn’t much crowd support and the sun started beating down, but I appreciate all the volunteers who manned their aid stations and provided that extra boost of encouragement when I came by.  This also felt similar to my bonk in a prior marathon where the breathing was fine and not hurried but the legs just had no strength.
Made it to the finish line with a slightly faster pace (8min/mi) over the last straightaway but still felt and looked wobbly and was on the verge of collapse after stopping.  Though I was humbled by the course, was very grateful for the support of friends &amp; family and the learning experience!


### Post-race
After the race I downed four little cartons of chocolate milk and a bunch of other snack food.  Immediately started feeling queasy and could barely get up after sitting down on the ground.  Though the DOMS would hit me in later days, was most worried by a huge piece of skin missing from the bottom of my foot.  It hurt a lot while my sister applied disinfectant and I was most worried about this keeping me from a return to running.  It’s 4 days later and I’m still feeling really sore.  In the last few days my only cardio has been a couple of 2 mile walks and a casual 5mi bike ride.  
Still, after reading others’ race reports it seems this is “normal” following a downhill mountain race.  If I could do it over again the big takeaways are:
1.	Don’t go out so hard
2.	Get rocks out of your shoe (also wear shoes more suited to the course and not Vaporflys) 
3.	Train more specifically for the course you’re racing..and never underestimate a course

### What's next?
Another huge takeaway is that I’ll have to pull out of a mountain 100mi ultra I was looking to run this year.  It’s 1 month before the Boston Marathon, and since I’m more focused on that race, realize that everyone else is right and it’ll be near impossible to do well at both.  At first I wanted to keep both on the calendar simply to prove to myself I could, but after seeing how destroyed my body is after this experience, realize good performances at both truly are mutually exclusive.

As always, thanks for reading!

887,AdvancedRunning,johncheger,Training Plans,"I’ve picked my next big race as a marathon in November.  I have a few training plans that I am looking at for guidance, but I am not able to follow them exactly (usually work/family schedule).  I imagine it depends on the program, but what do you see as the critical parts that I should follow as closely as possible?

889,AdvancedRunning,SelfSniped,Pfitz and Heat Acclimation,"I’m ramping up mileage for a few weeks to begin the Pfitz 18/70 (modified slightly for ultra distances). I have a 12 hr race in late August that is a prep race and 100mi in November. I live in Louisiana and the reality of fall racing means southern summertime training. Since heat, dehydration and natural heart rate drift all are fighting the ability to stay within a specified heart rate, running outdoors becomes difficult. I have access to treadmills but you don’t want to enter any race down here without being prepared for a warm race day….it’s possible almost all year round. 

My question, between all the types of runs the plan calls for, which ones are the safest or most sensical to make “heat acclimation” runs? I can make them as extreme as midday/early afternoon with 90+ (feels like 105+) or I can keep them as very early morning with lows as upper 70s (feels like mid 80s). 

My gut tells me recovery runs would make the most sense but it’s hard to keep my HR below 140 as is. I typically keep those indoors for that reason. The other side of the coin is going with V02max since it’s nearly my max at 185.

I ran in 2019 with a goal of getting under 3:30. I held about a 7:45 pace for the first 20 miles pretty comfortably, but blew up completely during the hills and finished a few minutes slower than 3:30.

I'm trying for the same goal this year, doing a lot more hill work, but I'm still curious how to pace myself ahead of mile 20.

Do I pace myself at 7:55 and hope I have enough in the tank to maintain an 8:00-8:15 uphill at the end?

Or do I try to really bank a lot of time at, say, 7:30 assuming the hill's going to kill me?

895,AdvancedRunning,gf2020,Ran a Marathon that gave me a time with a decimal place...what eventually does it count as for the BAA?,"I ran the light at the end of tunnel marathon on the 13th and my official time has vacillated very slightly in the days afterwards from 2:59:02 to 2:59:03 and is now bizarrely, a week later, updated to be officially official -- 2:59:02.1. I have never run a marathon before that gives the decimal place in official timing.

When I submit to Boston in November, is there a spot for a decimal place on the form? I can't remember from my last sign-up. It seems like US Track &amp; Field regulations suggest they would round up unless the decimal is literally .00. But if there isn't room for a decimal, am I in the clear to call it 2:59:02?

I know this is relatively silly to focus on but just curious. And also have read many an article where people miss the cut by one precious second and that would be especially painful if the extra detail of these timers screwed me over. So two questions to all you redditers.

1. What do I call my new PR?

### Training
Long story short: I love running. 2020 was a low point for everyone and I wasn't spared. I went through so many lows in training but never lost the love. The last time I raced I ran a 5k in October 2019. You all probably know what happens next. 2020 is gonna be my year. Well things don't always go the way you plan them. I went through some tremendous loss in 2020 as did the world and I leaned on running to help me survive. I have always loved running. 3 years ago I ran Grandmas for the first time and loved every minute of it. I ran around 3700 miles in 2020 and can count maybe 2 or 3 times I didn't feel like going for a run. I maintained that mileage up to Pfitz 12/87. I moved cities and got on with a stellar training group out here. Once again - I love running for introducing me to all kinds of people. I can honestly say I was not confident in reaching my goals. I struggled through workouts which were mostly solo, in the heat of the day, and really tough. It wasn't until I ran a huge MP workout (3x5 @ MP) with my new friends that I finally gained a little self belief. 

### Pre-race
Spent Thursday catching up with friends back home in MPLS, shaking out, and dinner with family. Just relaxing. Friday AM went to a group shakeout at Mill City Running, had an awesome time there, super cool people/culture there. Snagged some rad pasta at Va Bene in Duluth on Friday. Went to the place I was staying at in Wisconsin and had some pizza. I love carb loading. Slept like really good the last few days. That was a new experience for me. Woke up and just felt solid. 

### Race
The weather was a touch warmer than I was expecting, but still cooler than the east coast has been. I think the humidity and sun surprised some people. The mass start was a complete shit show. I showed up/lined up a bit late with some other sub 3 hopefuls and we spent the first mile and a half weaving past people. Luckily we maintained our composure and didn't run too hard. Shout out to those folks, they kept me in check for the first 6 and they killed it!  

At the first water station my friend yelled at me to take water and powerade even though I didn't think I needed it. Turns out she was right, she said people looked way sweatier than we felt. It was at this point I spotted my friends from my training group out east. They were a good .25mi ahead and I made a conscious effort to reel them in. I dropped the pace slightly and took about 3 miles to catch them. 

Miles 6 - 10 were pretty uneventful. Just locked in and cruising. I knew it was too early, but I felt good and took in the scenery of the north shore. At mile 10 my sicko friend decided she would drop a quicker one and I, being too dumb to say no, went with. The next few went in the high 6:30s and despite being the instigator, every split I called out was met with some explicative. 

The start being what is was meant we mostly ran in a group of 2 and latched on to smaller groups here and there, but were generally passing people slowly in the middle parts of the race. I'm sure I saw a couple of you out there, but its hard to know!  

At mile 19 we dropped a 6:28 and we agreed after 20 it was every one for themselves. I was feeling really good at this point and started to up the effort. It was at this point I went to some dark places. Lemon drop hurt really bad, but luckily I had friends waiting for me shortly after. This, plus folks at Sir Benedicts, and then family at 24-25 were the only thing that kept me sane. 6:21, 6:17, 6:13 to close. I finally negative split a race and notched a 2:53. 

I was just focused on not dying at this point. 

### Post-race
After I was pretty sure I wasn't going to die and could hear something other than my own breathing again I heard a friends name over the PA, which was 5+ mins faster than her goal and I was ecstatic. Celebrating with 3-4 friends that came across the line shortly afterward will be something I'll never forget. I'll be chasing that high for a long time.   

Hoping/Guessing that the BQ time will not be as insane as it was this year due to a full field in 2022. For now that is the planned next big race.  


I am now dealing with some post race blues, coming down from such a high is something I struggle with. The unknown of ever experience that camaraderie and success of achieving a goal I've worked so long for as well as running with such a solid group who also smashed it is scary. How blessed I've been to find such solid people in my running life. It also made me slightly home sick! I'm sure it will pass and I'll be on to my next goal... probably 10k related. As for the marathon... who knows? Sub 2:50? I believe I have a long way to go, I'm looking forward to the grind.

Time/goals: wait and see

The story of this race started 2 years ago. Amy (one of my very closest friends who I have put more than a thousand miles underfoot with) and Larry (a local training partner who is a total long distance badass) did this race together. Amy has lived in Brooklyn and was raised in Westchester so had a lot of familiarity with the course. She and Larry have so much fun doing this race and on some of our training runs they tell me about it. It sounds fun and something I’d like to do one day. 

2020 rolls around, I’m not even following this race – but it understandably gets cancelled, there are a lot of deferrals, but come late 2020 there are some 33 spots left and they decide to do a lotto for those spots for 21. Amy had already deferred a 2020 spot so she’s in and I realize this might be our only chance to ever do this race together, something I knew was important to me. So I sign up for the Lotto and in late December I found out I got in. I’m elated but also terrified, as the furthest I’ve ever done up to this point is a little over 100k, about 63 and change. 

The race is 100 miles all over NYC. I’ve been to NYC, like most tourists I’ve only spent time in Manhattan with occasional blips in Brooklyn. So I’m excited to see the city in a way I’d never do otherwise. 

Training:

As far as training I am already a decently high mileage baseline runner,  but instead of usual 65-70 mpw I worked in some 90 mile weeks. This was done mostly by making sure I got in a decently long run 20-30 on a Saturday followed by a 10-20 the next day. 

My biggest concern about this race was the heat. Of course I respect the distance, but for me respecting the distance came in the form of making sure I didn’t overheat because even at a shorter distance that would’ve been a nail in a coffin for me. As we look at the forecast it’s going to be the hottest day or nearly hottest day in NY yet this year – great. 

Pre-race:

I get to NYC and get to the hotel and Amy has already checked in and is there to greet me with a hug – it’s the best because this is only the second time I’ve seen her since she moved away to California. I miss her and I miss running with her, but we are about to do a lot of that! We grab some food because  I’m starving after the bus ride, buy some bodyglide and visit the M&amp;M store (I was told it’s the Mporium, get it?? Get it????) and get too many M&amp;Ms. We meet u/hollanding who is planning to meet us at mile 41 aid station with popsicles and she hangs out with us and we make a few jokes about getting a pork burrito for dinner. We eventually decide on a little pub, I have mushroom ravioli and it’s the first time I’ve eaten inside at a restaurant since march 1 2020. 

We meet Denise and Rachel her pacer and they are just lovely, we chat for a while and eventually part way to go back to the hotel grab some caffeine for the morning and get off our feet.

Race morning: 

Wake up 4 am June 19 

Amy has a few M&amp;Ms and I have forgotten my protein bar so I eat a honey stinger waffle – oops. But #1 most important thing happens in the bathroom so I’m happy about that. I put lube everywhere I can think of (spoiler it’s not enough and I didn’t think of everywhere) and get dressed. I’m scared and excited. We walk the 2 very short blocks to the race start. Everyone knows Amy and Amy knows everyone. It’s so reassuring to know I’m with someone who is such a pro at this. I’m in good hands.  There are going to be wave starts, the RD expects us to be kinda fast so we are in one of the latest waves. At first we were sad about it but it ends up being great.

5:22 And we’re off! We head north out of Times Sq through Columbus circle and up the west side of central park. It’s so early there’s hardly anyone in central park, the really fast people in the wave behind us quickly pass us, but then we also catch up and pass some people readily. So the wave start actually meant we got to kinda run with everyone a little bit, its really nice actually.  As we head out of the northwest corner of central park we are now further  north than I have ever been in Manhattan. We hit our first hill and it’s time to walk, there is a long way left to go in this race and Amy lets me know wasting our energy on steep hills is not the way to go. We breeze past 5 mile aid station (they are roughly every 5 miles and henceforth I’ll refer to them as aid(milemarker)) and continue one, these first sections have a lot of trail. We learn they added more trail in the first marathon where they did an out and back to orchard beach last time, So we got the benefit of more shade but also more time romping in the poison ivy and up and down. You wouldn’t think that so close to the city there are all these very real trails but they are there! We run most of these trails with Tiger, she’s totally lovely, going to be at Boston! Must’ve done some beastly training runs for this. Somewhere up ahead we see Ray K and we get a selfie with him and continue on. I found out later my friend’s parents were going to come out and watch me but ended up getting Ray a burger and a drink and crewing him xD. A little further on in another trail section we catch up to Michael Ortiz, we catch up for a while, it’s his first hundred in a long while, he used to do one every weekend, sounds like that time off has been kind to him and he’s really thankful to be doing this race. We stick together for a while before heading off on our own.

We finally come out of the trail sections, maybe mile 22 (forgive if these markers aren’t totally correct some of it’s a blur) and now the blessing of shade had disappeared. It’s HOT we see our first open bodega and pop in and grab a monster each. It’s extremely refreshing. None of the aid stations up until this point had had any ice so having something really cold was \*chefskiss\* . Amy downs her monster in no time, I take a few sips and carry mine while we jog some more. We are running down a lot of pavement industrial sections for a while, we end up passing something called the fish parade?? And they all cheer for us and the few other runners we are with. We have some great conversations with these runners, its another guy’s first hundred and we are happy to have company during this very urban section, it helps us have some better awareness for not getting lost (which we had already done a little bit of at this point). 

We get through this greenway section that just has an amazing view of the city across the water, it’s mindblowing that we have come that far away already and that in many many many hours we are going to get back there. Amy’s telling me about all the good and bad decisions. We end up running with and leapfrogging a bit with a nice couple from Raleigh, we get into the first aid station that has ice and I get it in my hat, my bandana, and in my sun sleeves. As the guy is putting the ice in my sleeves I tell him I am suddenly VERY attracted to him. We Laugh, I see they have PBJ and I get half a sandwich and we press on just down the street for Amy to stop in and buy a popsicle. And I take a break in the shade. 

\*break break\* 

So I put a lot of effort into allowing my friends and family to track me during this race, My husband gave me his old 935 since it has a much better battery than my old watch, I brought an extra battery so I could connect to Garmin’s livetrack feature, and I was tracking distance using /u/ak11235813213455 old stryd, so far all of these had been working perfectly, so probably 35 people had been watching us progress through the streets of NY and I had been getting encouraging messages from people. So I had 3 friends doing races at Grandmas and AK and Russ also had races and I’m eager to check in on them.

\*back to race\*

So this was my first check in other than sending a memey photo of us with Monster. This check in is great, it’s HOT but I’m all iced up from the aid station and I’m checking all these lovely messages and trying to get race progress but seems grandmas isn’t over yet so I just keep plodding along. Amy comes back with her popsicle and we are full of vigor and move forward. The next 10 miles are probably some of the hardest 30-41 were really rough. After leaving the 50k aid full up on ice it was great, but it was melting quick and 35 aid in Astoria had no ice and popsicles were melted so that put a huge damper in our oomph. Specifically the 2.5 miles on Astoria Blvd were just brutal and this spot probably sucked the most energy out of us. Amy was having a rough time between miles 37 and 41 but one of her super powers is being a problem solver. I was grateful for a little bit of slowdown since it was just scorching. /u/hollanding lets us know a few people have come through aid and she’s there with ICE – we are mega excited and that helps us power through even though both of us are roasting. 

Mile 41 aid is a godsend. /u/hollanding is there and the first person I see and I’m so happy to see her. She has so much energy and I’m dying lol. There is shade and there is ample ice and all kinda of drink options. I get some unspecified red juice that gives me life and a rice ball, but more importantly ICE. Ice Ice Ice. I am starting to understand why people love aid stations so much. Amy has a gallon of juice and after spending a little too long we amble out of aid 41 and /u/hollanding accompanies us to Flushing and tells updates me on /u u/ak11235813213455  race ( I wont spoil it but there was some crazy shit). She parts ways with us and we thank her for her mile and a half of energy and we continue on. At this point both of us would really REALLY like a bathroom and we stopped a couple places to ask but were denied, we pass Leavitts park in Flushing and the gate is unlocked and there’s a few people setting up, we ask them if we can use the bathroom and they say yes and we are so grateful. 

So at this point we are iced up from aid 41 and have just gone to the bathroom, we have some renewed vigor again, had a change to wash face off in the bathroom and feel like new women. We continue on.  We go past memorial field of flushing in a few more miles and play in a water fountain to cool off. For the next little while we are passing lots of house with cute tidy yards with impeccable landscaping and I’m mostly pointing and going “ ooh look at the cute one” and  “ that wrought iron is a little ornate for my tastes” and “ that’s not a regulation corner fence I bet that was a pain in the ass”. 

We come up on milestone of 50 miles and celebrate, I decide it's time to check my batteries on watch and phone to make sure everyone can keep tracking us. I plug in my watch to the battery  and it immediately quits the activity. I am livid. Amy is still pulling me along but I’m having a hard time because my phone is so covered in water from the ice on me melting, nothing is dry so I cant get the livetrack to restart, and of course now I don’t have any of my data from the first 50 miles so I cant see our average pace or distance anymore and I’m angry that now I’m gonna have to stitch files and my data is gonna be all messed up and mostly just the weeks of testing all this stuff working together was basically for nothing and I won't have a complete file. Amy suggests I restart my phone and that eventually get the livetrack back up, but my new activity is now starting back from 0 and that hurts to look at after being at this for nearly 12 hrs. But we get to Aid 50, they have ICE and THIN MINTS, I don’t sit down or anything but I don’t exactly hustle either. 

I have really fond memories of this section. We are on a really wide paved trail next to a parkway along a lake or inlet of some kind. The clouds have just started rolling in and as we look at the sky it doesn’t look like we are going to be getting any more direct sunlight. Amy announces that the worst of it has passed and we are both profoundly grateful. At this point we are trying to calculate where we could finish. We’d have to be pretty aggressive for 24 (especially with our slight navigational errors) so we are thinking about what 25-26 hr and possibly 27 hr means for how much sleep we might get the next day before we have to get out of the city. Conversation ensues. 

Amy tells me one of the best things we could do would be to get more efficient at aid stations, dropping a 22 minute mile in there because you faff around at said is really easy to tack on loads of time. Wish I had gotten better at that before mile 50 but every aid station after I ask how I did and it was always better. 

We are thankful for clouds and ice and passing 50m and we start picking points out ahead of us that we can jog to. This is a strategy that is working and we continue to employ it. 

We continue on for many more miles. One of the things about this race is that you are often looking for tiny yellow arrows to point you on the path. Sometimes they are not where you expect them and you just have to trust your gut that you are going the right way and if you don’t see an arrow for a while you start to second guess. Sometimes you are right, sometimes you are wrong. 

One of the neighborhoods we go through here has front lawns that are all exclusively vegetable gardens, it was very cool, near Queens Botanic Gardens. Eventually we come to flushing meadows, what a sight. Even when we were leaving Times sq at 5 am there was hardly anyone around, but flushing meadows at 6 ish pm on a Saturday was HOPPING. I’m not sure if there was a festival or if it’s like this every weekend, but there were all these stalls and tents to buy food, people playing soccer, ice cream stands (yes we partook, one entering the park and one exiting 😊 ) a spectator telling us we are doing a great job and we are with a couple other racers. We go past a very strange lookin thing called the Unisphere, past some ponds and over a pedestrian bridge and we are gone, the brief mile full of life and city dwellers and birthday parties and drool-inducing bbq smells is over. We are making forward progress. I lost a sun sleeve in the park when I was shuffling stuff around, my only casualty thankfully and past the time when I would need ice in the sleeves. 

100k Sneaks up on us. I had heard there would be “ real food” at 100k so I'm disappointed when we got there and they just had standard Aid Fare. Amy had warned me that 100k would be the easiest place to linger so not to get too comfy so we ask for our drop bags, ditch my sun sleeves, hat, and visor and it feels great. I change shirts and realize the chafing on my back is pretty bad. I’m starting to wonder if my pack is too small? I bought it and took it with me on 30mi training runs, but at this point It’s starting to sting to a point where I’m wishing I could ditch it but I know that’s a bad idea. So we start to leave Aid 100k (62m) and as we leave there are some ladies (they must be crewing a different runner) and they have a box of like 2 dozen white castle. I could’ve kissed them. I grab 2 mini burgs and munch them down and I am sooo happy. I’m also realizing that my pack feels WAY BETTER when I’m running with it unclipped. This is a game changer for the rest of the run. I’m way more comfortable. This is the point at which I realize I never want to run something this long where I have to run with a pack ever again. Fixed timed or shorter looped courses in my future. 

This is where I have to brag on Amy. I’m likely to stop a jog at this point and have a bit of a mosey before I recall I need to walk with purpose. Amy walks with purpose the moment the jog is done and that’s one reason she excels at this. She constantly amazes me and I’m at a point where I keep apologizing for slowing us down. She chides me for apologizing but keeps the pressure on me because she has faith that I can do it. I apologize if I’ve said anything untoward but she’s a great friend and understands I’m just in pain, as is she. I briefly talk about how quitting sounds nice. My butt is chafing and stings and I don’t like it one bit its starting to rain on us and I’m starting to just feel down about being so low energy. We had talked about stopping to get some caffeine but there just weren’t many options on the course where we were, we promise we will stop at a bodega once we pass one on the course… unfortunately there aren’t any for a while (more to come on that later). Amy stops at Dunkin and get a 32 oz coffee coolatta at mile 64. I keel over, just standing feels so good I don’t even care that I'm being rained on. I text my husband and the group chat and tell them how I feel awful and they all encourage me and it’s lovely &lt;3. It’s weird because at the end of my last 100k I still had so much energy, but I guess a track surface is much nicer to the feet and weather conditions were very different.

Anywho, we press on and get to aid 65 in the dark. Amy knows this Aid Station head, John. They are very nice and encouraging. They have an aid station doggo who is curled up like a shrimp in a chair and is very cute. I ask if they have lube for my poor booty and they DO! I ask for wet wipes so we can get out of sight because nobody needs to see this and they oblige and we are off basically heading out onto a very dark pathway next to a road and lots of people fishing on the other side of the fence we are running on. I have never been so thankful for anti-chafe cream. It was incredible. Sweet relief. I’ll just say from now on at every aid station I ask for more cream and that problem mostly goes away. 1 pt to me for problem solving. 

One of the most memorable moments of the whole race was this crab the size of a hand skitters out in front of us at mile 68. Just doing crabby things going back and forth. I say “CRAB” and Amy sees the crab and it scares her a little. I don’t think either of us were expecting that at that moment. It was very funny. We joke about crabs the rest of the run. 

I’m feeling pretty low. I don’t feel like I can keep up with Amy, we aren’t even at mi 70 yet and I just feel so crappy. I really want to check in on my phone and message my husband because it’s getting late. We take a break from walkjog to just call him so I can get a pick me up. He told me about his day and it was taking my mind off my pain even though I was surely going much slower while talking on the phone. Amy is telling him I’m doing amazing and I am so profoundly thankful she’s there with me. We only talked for 4 minutes but it felt nice to hear his voice and then we continued on. We find a magical port-a-potty. It is clean, had the capacity to flush with your foot, and a sink you turned on with your foot, and two brand new rolls of TP. The things you are thankful for. Was nice to have a break and now we come up on aid 71. 

Aid 71 was a magical place. Archie the support corgi was at Aid 71. I squealed, I petted, I took a photo, I lubed, we left and continued on to the rockaway boardwalk. Though I was not moving particularly fast, this was one of my favorite parts. It was so peaceful along the water. This felt like I place that should be FULL of people, but it was 10 (or later I dunno) PM and there was no one here. It felt like such a long boardwalk with nothing but the waves crashing to our left and some twinkling lights from apartments to our right. We are catching up to a guy, we come to learn his name is Matt. He’s cool. He's from the area and he got to sleep in his own bed last night, very cool. We get through some real dark spots and Aid 75 (there was chicken broth and HOT DOGS mmm). Amy gets us on the one block on one block off run/walk strategy and it gets us through this very fancy neighborhood as we head towards Coney Island Boardwalk. Notice at this point I still haven’t gotten that Bodega monster I was hoping for. There’s something awful about knowing you still have a whole marathon left before you finish. It just feels unbelievable that your sore and aching feet could possibly make it through 6 more hours of this. Amy suggests some mindfulness exercises, I try them and honestly they help but also I feel like I cant focus on moving forward so I get slower.  Matt sticks with us until mile 81 where he picks up a pacer and they rush off with great speed, we are impressed he had so much left in the tank, go Matt!

Coney island boardwalk is rough, I really have to pee, nothing is open. I was hoping we’d get here early enough that stuff was still open but it’s a loooong time on the boardwalk before we get off. (Also get slightly off course here whoops). But as we leave we come down a street, I remember the street names of Neptune and Mermaid there was a gas station.  So something I have learned about NYC is that all the gas station owners lie and say their bathrooms are out-of-order because they don’t want people using them. I plead with the guy to let me use the bathroom he says no and doesn’t like the insinuation that they aren’t being truthful, I buy the monster and move on. Amy drinks half and I put the rest in my soft flask. 10 min later I can’t take it anymore and pee in some bushes. That plus the monster and somewhere at 85 miles I am a new woman. I had a couple bites of cold pizza at aid 85 and as we continue on Amy tells me how energetic I am. We are super fast (relatively) for the next 5 miles and end up passing 2-4 racers (can’t remember exactly where everyone was) there was a longish 4 miles section where you go under the Verrazano bridge though it was long you could see the statue of liberty off in the distance. Amy tells me that’s where the NYCM starts, and I’ll be back there in November for the marathon. It better be cool by then or I will revolt. 

We get to Aid 90, we are in and out fast, grab a popsicle for a road (did I mention it was hot?) eat them pretty quickly and get back to employing the one block on one block off strategy. This section feels different. The blocks are short so there’s a lot of walking but a lot of running too. People aren’t exactly “up” yet, but there is activity around. Amy reminds me that there is only one more Aid station (HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??) and I am in disbelief. She used to live in Brooklyn and tells me about things on the streets she’s familiar with and where she used to live. We have perfected a strategy of counting to 20 while running. We are VERY good at counting to 20. I’m starting to get excited but my body is not keeping up with my brain’s excitement. Also I have to pee again oops. 

We get to Aid 95, we can see Brooklyn Bridge in the distance. They cheer us into the Aid station and I ask if they have a bathroom and they all encourage me to go into the bushes. I do it and feel so much better. Guys there's only 5 miles left. Amy dances to their aid station music, we don’t really need much. Reminding ourselves 5 miles chump change on a normal day. We get down to the Brooklyn Bridge entrance and there are TWO FLIGHTS of STAIRS. Rude. But really it was fine. We get onto the bridge and it’s just gorgeous. It’s sunrise and we are finally right here at the edge of Manhattan. We know we just have to get to times sq. We could walk it in completely and still be in under 26 now. When we get off the Bridge and head north towards Times Sq. I start to get emotional. Thanking Amy for everything she’s done for me, for being such a friend to spend all this time doing something so hard. I nearly cry, but I’m focused on moving forward. 

All this time focusing on Arrows, this yellow arrow that yellow arrow. Did you see a yellow arrow? FOUND AN ARROW! I think I see an arrow over there? Oh no that’s a piece of trash. Oh actually it’s a leaf. ARROW ACQUIRED.   This commentary happened over and over and by the time we got into Manhattan you’d think we would’ve figured it out. Well guess what, we make it onto Broadway. If you know NY you know Broadway will take us all the way to the finish line at 42nd. But somehow…we got onto 5th ave and not Broadway, so we added on this extra distance AGAIN right near the end. Thankfully we figure this out and after looking at a map (boo stopping) we got back on track.  I think I have nearly given some friends a heart attack. I knew they would be up and watching and that helped power me through too.  We get to 38th, these streets are small, we can see 40th. We can smell it. We run it in. The small bunch of people at the finish line see us and are cheering from 2 blocks away we are ready and cannot wait until the sweet release of being prone. We get there.

The finish line is across the street.

The cars have a green light. 

They seem to not want to move.

We wait for them to go by for an eternity.

We cross. 

It’s over. 

POSTRACE:

RD marks us down 17/18th overall, not sure where that puts us for women but based on the photos it seems like we are maybe 5/6/7 somewhere in there. Feels cool. The RD tells us more people dropped this year than in previous years because it was just so damn hot, makes the finish line feel even sweeter. Our finish time is something like 24:52. Under 25 hrs how awesome is that?! We got joint 3/4 women!!!  HOLY COW are you KIDDING ME??

Amy tells me I was much faster than her first 100 and how proud of me she is. I love her, can you tell dear reader??. We get our buckles, remember we need our drop bags. Amy tells me to head on to the hotel and she’ll bring the bags over so I can start getting cleaned up. I get up and start hobbling towards the hotel. It’s pretty common for me to get really lightheaded after a hard effort so I’m glad the hotel is close, but whew, I barely make it. I can barely stand in this hot elevator. The sweet release of making it into the hotel room I had been dreaming about for the last 14 hours was realized. I showered, it wasn’t so bad, but I also didn’t try very hard. My feet ache. I put them up. I pass out until Amy shows up with the bags. We don’t talk a ton because we are both exhausted, but it’s a solidarity in exhaustion. We both feel the same way. Grateful to have experienced the city together, to have spent time together when we don’t see each other, and to be off our feet. After she’s done washing up we head out and grab some breakfast. I hobbled there, I had eggs benny - it was delicious. The bus ride home was spent catching up with everyone who cheered for me and finally saying hi and thank you. Three people have already told me since they want to do this race. I hope they can because it was pretty magical. 

Notes:

Thank you to my husband who always has faith that I can achieve my goals even if I don't.

Thanks to all my sweet and kind friends and family who were cheering for me your messages meant everything and your continued friendship is the best gift &lt;3.

I wrote a lot of this in post-race haze so please forgive the typos and grammar I have no intention of fixing. 

I brought a second phone that had a cracked screen so I wouldn’t rinse my primary phones battery taking photos. Alas I haven’t been able to get to them because I think all the sweat might’ve gotten the screen. 

Somehow I only seem to have gotten two tiny blisters and nothing more on each of my heels. Injinji Magic I guess. 

Lots of people gave me unsolicited shoe choice opinions. Maybe lightweight 2018 Nike FREE RNs are a bad choice but hey I made it.",1624333453
907,AdvancedRunning,Urpledell,Half marathon training help,"Hello I seem to be struggling hard with half marathon training. I’ve been cycling through workouts but I just can’t seem to get a gauge of how well I can race a half or how to improve. I have never raced one before. I was hoping people could give suggestions on what kinds of workouts worked for them. Also workouts that help them with racing on tired legs. I already do 3 x 2 mile a lot, sometimes I’ll do a Michigan or a lumberjack although I don’t have access to a track anymore so those are kind of out.

908,AdvancedRunning,redheadnamedpeaches,How to adapt the Pfitz 10k training plan with a low starting weekly mileage,"I plan on racing a 10k in mid-September, which is just so happens to be 13 weeks away, perfect for Pfitz's 12-week 10k program. I've been running 15-20m/week, which includes playing soccer, so not strictly running. This is below the 30-42 weekly mileage recommended to start the plan. Not wanting to overdo it and get injured (I'd like to run okay, but not trying to bust out a massive PR), I plan on running the program, and simply backing off on some of the mileage, perhaps building up as it progresses. The Sept race could also be a mini-peak, with a bigger peak at Thanksgiving (would love to win a pie at a local Turkey Trot). 

My running background: I ran track in college (400m, 800m, high jump), but am more comfortable at longer distances. Never ran a proper 10k, though my PR is 37:54 from a 8 mile tempo run with bookend 1m warm up/cool down.

Any thoughts on reducing mileage/cutting anything out?",1624314013
909,AdvancedRunning,jelwood989,Running plan for breaking 4:30 in the mile?,"Hello all!

I was wondering if anyone here could point me towards a quality training plan for the mile, my goal being to run sub-4:30.

In highschool I ran a 4:32.56, and it has been a goal of mine ever since to knock off those last few seconds. 

Currently I'm running about 12 miles a week as I coming back from a hip strain. However I feel great and I am ready to graudually up my mileage and commit to a plan. 

A bit about me - I ran track in highschool, and was part of the triathlon team at my university. I have a history of hip injuries which has recurred a few times now, although proper care and management keeps me healthy. Historically I have a 2:40 PR in the 1000m and a 16:45 in the 5k, all in highschool.

Towards the end of my long run yesterday I started feeling pain in the mid to top of me right achilles that progressively got worse. Pain started at around mile 13-14 out of 18. 

My achilles now hurts to the touch and hurts on and off while walking. The pain is about 7-8 inches up from the heel. Everywhere I look for more info/ advice points towards insertional achilles pain, which I do not have. I have had many injuries in the past 2 years since I started training. My soleus was strained in the same leg 8 months ago but this is different. All of my injuries were preceded by increasing pain throughout the weeks leading up to the point where I had to stop running, but this was sudden. There was no sharp pain or pop which makes me hopeful it's not a tear. 

Has anyone dealt with something like this? 

How soon can I get back to running?

Should I stretch and foam roll?

I have a marathon planned for September, really hoping I can resume training and hit my goal for this race.

Background: 29M, 6'1, 165lbs, averaging 45-50MPW. I have been steadily increasing my milage the last few months with absolutely no problems.

### Training

A little background for context..I started running long distance at the start of covid when all the gyms closed. I played soccer through college so I had a decent cardio base but at the age of 24 (currently 26) I popped my ACL. The pandemic hit right around the time I was fully recovered from surgery. At the time all I was doing was lifting and rehab so my cardio wasn't great. I was struggling to run a 9 minute mile and couldn't string 2 miles together without stopping. By the fall of 2020 I was a much better runner so I decided to sign up for a spring/summer marathon. I managed to get a spot for the full at grandmas and off I went with training. 

I officially started training for grandmas in January. At that point I was pretty comfortable running 30 miles/week so my plan was to build up about 10-15% a week for 3 straight weeks then do a low volume week. Rinse and repeat until the taper 2 weeks prior to grandmas. I managed to build up to 65mpw at my peak and stayed injury free. 

I started my taper 2 weeks prior to grandmas and it was hell. It was 90+ degrees and humid for the entire taper period. Every run felt high effort and everything was slow. This being my first attempt at a marathon I had essentially convinced myself I somehow lost all fitness even though I never stopped running. Thankfully in the last couple days before the race the weather cooled off and I got a couple of short tempo runs in which built my confidence. Going in to the race, I had the goal of going sub 3:30 which I felt was very doable for where I was at. I had decided in the days prior that if things were feeling good I would push and try to come in at 3:20.

### Pre-race

I live in the Twin Cities so the travel is pretty easy to Duluth. Just a couple hour drive up 35 and you're there. I had the day off work Friday so I drove up early and got up to Duluth by 11am. I spent the day trying to stay relaxed. I got my bib and race packet, dropped off my gear bag and feasted on some spaghetti. I went to bed that night with tons of nerves but I kept telling myself that there was nothing I could do to improve my fitness now so may as well get some shut eye. That helped me get decent sleep. 

### Race

Miles 1-6 Splits 7:52, 7:35, 7:27, 7:33, 7:22, 7:30

Going in all the advice I received was to take the first few miles slow. I tried to take that advice but it only lasted about a mile. I get excited and got up to what I thought was a quick pace. I did a lot of my training runs around 7:45 pace so these miles felt fast but I was feeling really good so I decided to roll with it. Also, I made the decision at the first water station that I wasn't going to skip a single one and I was going to take my gels every 40 minutes rather than every hour like I originally planned. 

Miles 7-13 Splits 7:26, 7:28, 7:27, 7:11, 7:32, 7:23, 7:15

I was really in my groove through this section. Everything felt really easy. I was starting to think I was a lot more fit than I had initially thought. However, there was a long way to go so it was no time to get cocky. Around mile 13 I started to feel the first little bits of fatigue hit my legs. Specifically my hamstrings and hips. I was absolutely not prepared for all the downhill sections of the grandmas course. 

Miles 14-20 Splits 7:25, 7:31, 7:28, 7:33, 7:33, 7:23, 7:41

The splits don't really show it but things started to get a little tougher here. My main focus at this point was to just get to mile 20 and reassess how things are feeling. The rolling hills were taking their toll but I was still hitting my numbers despite the legs feeling heavier. I was confident at this point that as long as the wheels don't completely fall off I was going to post a good time. 

Miles 21-26 Splits 7:44, 7:37, 7:46, 7:40: 7:35, 7:40

So this is where I learned all about the wall that everyone is always going on about. Things really got tough at mile 21. Grandmas veterans always bring up Lemon Drop hill at mile 22. What they all fail to mention is that there as a solid mile stretch of a slight downhill leading up to lemon drop. After all the downhill sections in the previous 21 miles my hamstrings were fried so that section was especially challenging. If anything I was happy to have a little uphill to even things out. Once lemon drop was behind me I knew I was on the home stretch. I mean, its JUST 4 miles left right? that's easy. Well it didn't end up being so easy. I was absolutely redlining at this point. My heart rate data showed I was comfortable in the 180's for the last 6 miles. An absolute battle. My splits were a bit slower but not too bad. Overall I was happy with how I held up in the final miles. 

### Post-race

I was ecstatic to finish at 3:17. I really had not anticipated holding a 7:33 average the whole time. For a first timer I am really happy with the result. I became a much more confident runner through the training process but I gained so much more confidence from this race. It might sound crazy but running 3:17 this time confirmed to me that someday I can run sub 3. My new goal is to make an attempt at 2:59 next spring. In the mean time, I will be running the twin cities marathon on October 3rd so training starts in about a week.

\### Background

M24, I ran quite a bit back in high school and into my first year of college (non-competitively in college), but took a few years off after that due to frustrating injuries popping up, less time, etc. Maybe once a year or so I'd make an effort to try and get back into the shape I once was, but one of those things always seemed to keep me from really getting back. COVID turned out to be a good motivator for actually getting back into running shape and I had a decent summer/fall 2020 stretch of running peaking around 45 mpw. That fall I tried building up my long run for a go at a sub 3 time trial, but a very busy end of the semester and foot pain kept me from ever getting there.

Started up again this winter with some inconsistent running after graduating and moving. I had no plans of racing but my employer announced a give-away for entries to Grandma's Marathon in March which was too good to pass up. After a solid 10 day stretch without running I heard that I won an entry and now had 12 weeks left till the race. Ope. Time to get in shape.

This would be my second marathon and first one in 8 years - I ran a 3:30 back in high school. The goal would be a sub 3.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Training

I didn't really follow a structured plan, more-so went along some very broad mileage and long run goals. Admittedly this led to some strange weeks and most of my long runs being far more of my weekly mileage as they probably should have been. A typical week was something of this sort:

M: easy

Tu: tempo (3-5 miles total @ low 6:00 pace, sometimes split into 2 reps)

W: easy

Th: easy

F: easy

Sa: long

Su: rest

In reality, most weeks early on I was doing 2-3 rest days a week and trying to make up the miles elsewhere. The 12 week buildup and each week's long run were:

| Week | Mileage | Long run |

|------|------|------|

1 | 20 | 15 @ 8:04

2 | 28 | 17 @ 7:39

3 | 22 | none

4 | 41 | 20 @ 7:40

5 | 35 | 14 @ 6:58

6 | 45 | 20 @ MP (6:49)

7 | 53 | 20 @ 7:24

8 | 54 | 22 @ 7:13 (tried to do last 11@ MP)

9 | 50 | none

10 | 48 | 18 @ 7:50

11 | 42 | 14 @ 7:30, last 3 @ MP (6:46)

12 | 46 | 26.2 race

Overall, my training felt like it went really well. I ran on trails as much as I could for my easy miles until the last couple weeks when I had a couple ankle rolls and decided to stay on the pavement to avoid that happening again. My weak ankles and the benefits of low impact trail running always seem to be at odds with each other. Yes, running &gt;50% of my weekly mileage in the long run several weeks was quite stupid. Also - running 20 miles @ MP on week 6 was probably not the best idea. I will say however, it gave me a lot of confidence for being in sub 3 shape despite crashing towards the end. I did somewhat of a ""soft taper"" after my peak on week 8, just gradually backing off the mileage and keeping a weekly tempo until the final week of the race. Race week included a 7 miler with 2 @ MP on Tuesday, then just 4-5 easy Wednesday - Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Made an effort to hydrate well the day before, spaghetti for supper. Woke race morning at 4 AM and took my time with my morning coffee, bagel, and banana. Got geared up and headed down to the DECC to catch the train to the start line. Weather was nice enough I left my sweats in the car. After a nice hour or so long ride and some good conversation we arrived around 7 with \~45 minutes to go. Got through the port a john lines in another 25 minutes and made my way into the starting corral. Weather was looking great - 50s, sun for the time being and a slight breeze. Another 20 minutes and we were off.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Start - 10K:

As I was shooting for 2:59, I was tentatively leaning towards a slower first mile or two around 6:55, but I just felt too good to let the slight downhill go to waste. Came through 10K in 41:17, feeling really great.

6:42 - 6:41 - 6:42 - 6:41 - 6:36 - 6:35

10K - 13.1:

Miles 7-9 I felt pretty good just maintaining 6:40 pace. Took my first gel at mile 7. Mile 10 offered a pretty solid downhill, the biggest on the course which I felt good striding out on. Coming through the halfway mark I could only think about how great I was still feeling, and I seemed to be still speeding up. Another gel at 13. Half split was 1:26:56.

6:38 - 6:39 - 6:41 - 6:23 - 6:35 - 6:34 - 6:28

13.1 - 20:

The next few miles I seemed to be feeling even better. I was pushing the pace into the 6:20s and was down to an average pace of around 6:34. In my mind I just had to get to 23 miles and I'd definitely be able to kick it in even faster. Somewhere along the way I had convinced myself with some bad mental math that 6:39 pace was on par for 2:50 and that 6:33 pace was good for a 2:45. ""You're gonna run a freaking 2:45!"" I kept telling myself. I guess my brain was fatiguing earlier than my body. They'd both be on the same wavelength soon enough.

6:23 - 6:27 - 6:29 - 6:32 - 6:30 - 6:29 - 6:43

20 - 23.9:

Took my final gel at mile 20, right about the same time things started to come back to reality. From 20-22.5 or so there is some gradual uphill capped off with Lemon Drop Hill, really only about a 50' or so hill, but at 22 it felt like a mountain. Pace going up it dropped to 7 high, and while I could gain some back on the downhill after, I definitely no longer felt like I could rip like I was a few miles earlier. The pace slipped, and after passing people for most of the first 20 miles, I was the one being passed.

6:49 - 6:53 - 7:03 - 6:57

23.9 - Finish:

The last couple miles through town I was just trying to stay around 7:00 pace.  Sub 3 was almost for sure at this point barring disaster. However, my horrible mental math had me convinced I was still on track for sub 2:50, if I could just keep myself under 6:40 pace (my Garmin isn't set to show me time, just mile/net pace, distance, and HR). So it was a bit of a surprise coming around the corner to see the clock at 2:55, but honestly all I cared about was getting the sub 3 and being done.

7:03 - 7:02 - 6:39 pace (last .28). 2:55:10 official

\### Post-race

Took a slow walk through the finish grabbing some water and a banana. Then made my way down to Lake Superior for a nice wade into the cold water. For having just run a marathon I felt pretty good. Dinner at Grandma's with my parents who came for the weekend and a nap had me back to normal minus some sore legs.

\### Reflections

A big thing I was worried about for the race was fuel/hydration. Aside from the fact that I can't seem to drink on the run without pouring half of it down the wrong tube, I seemed to get enough water and nutrition and didn't really bonk. Gels at 7, 13, and 20 seemed to be a good fit.

I did probably push a bit too fast in the middle miles, but this was more-so a race to figure out what kind of shape I was in. Had I negative split the whole way I don't think I would've quite figured that out, so I'm alright with that for now.

I'm already looking for another race to get in and excited to try a more structured and sensible plan this time. I'm thinking possibly Pfitz 18/70 if I can maybe find a good November marathon, otherwise maybe I'll do some shorter races this year and train for a spring marathon or Grandma's again next year. I think I can get my 10K and half PRs pretty reasonably by the end of the year. Regardless, sub 3 feels really good to get out of the way and I can't wait to bring it down even more!

### Training
I meant to write my training section before the race, so that it wouldn't influence what I thought of it, but I didn't get around to it.  So know that this is with the results in mind.  I did the Pfitz 12/87 plan more or less by the book.  I blew up on some workouts, almost all of them because I aggressively ignored the weather conditions and would go run 5k PR pace in like 85 degrees.  I'm not smart.  Key workouts were 17/12 @ MP, which I nailed in 22 mph winds, and averaged 6:27 pace.  This was pretty in line with my 15k prediction for the full from my last race before covid, and I felt more fit than I did when I raced that, so it seemed like an ok enough goal.  My regular long runs and medium were all pretty stellar all in all.  Those MLRs had me feeling a bit like an aerobic beast.  The 10k tune ups proved that I didn't necessarily have a ton of wheels though.  Overall, I could tell I was pretty fit, but having just a little bit more time, and a few more really good workouts would have helped my confidence a bit.

### Pre-race
Traveled to Duluth on Thursday.  I booked a pretty early flight on Southwest, with the intention of getting to Duluth early afternoon, and taking care of everything that I needed to take care of, and just relaxing all day on Friday.  That unfortunately did not happen.  

I woke up at 3 am, to find a text from Southwest saying ""Lol your flight is cancelled good luck.""  Maybe not verbatim, but that's how I read it at 3 am.  Groggy I checked their other flights to find out that those didn't exist.  So I got to book a one way ticket day of on Delta.  It cost more than my round trip ticket did with Southwest.  

Get to the airport to get a text from Delta saying, ""Lol this flight is delayed, good luck nerd.""  Again, maybe not verbatim.  Whatever.  I'm already here I'll just chill in the airport.  Several delays later, I switch my flight to a plane that isn't broken cause I can see where this is going.  Get to Minneapolis.  No luggage.  It's still on the other plane because Big Plane is against me.  So I hangout in the luggage area for awhile, hoping that the plane in Oklahoma will actually leave and get to Minneapolis.  

At about 5:30 PM I get fed up with this and talk to the baggage person.  She said ""We'll send it on to Duluth and you can pick it up first thing tomorrow morning.""  So I leave the airport and drive to a running store to pick up enough gear to at least do my shakeout runs.  Luckily I had my race kit in my backpack so that was with me and I wasn't a total mess.  Just mostly a mess.  Finally roll into Duluth at 8:30 PM, get the worst shakeout in the history of shakeouts in and call it a night.  

Next morning I do the second worst shakeout in the history of shakeouts, and then I drive to the airport.  Luggage didn't get there.  Apparently the flight from OKC didn't land until 11 PM.  RIP those poor people who got to the airport at 5 am for that flight.  They said the luggage will be in around an hour for now.  I went to get donuts, and met the brother the original course director for Grandma's so that was neat.  Also the donuts were great.  Go back to the airport and get my luggage finally.  Then I spent about an hour in traffic trying to get my bib from the expo.  So much for a low key Friday before the race.

That evening I met up with /u/run_inxs and grabbed some pizza, which was great.  Next morning I got up, drank coffee, fretted more than I should have and then got on the bus out to the start.  Met up with /u/spacecadette126 since we were shooting for around the same time and with the rolling start we were both afraid it would get a little lonely out there.  Lined up a little too far back, but told myself it's ok the first mile is the warmup and being a hair slow will be a good thing.

### Race
Gun/F-18s go off and we're off to the races.  According to the results, I passed 951 people in the first 10k.  About 750 of them were in the first mile.  Grandma's asked that the slower people show up on later buses due to the COVID protocols affecting the start.  Passed more than person in the first mile doing the run walk thing.  Thanks guys.  Things thinned out by about mile 2 or 3 and we settled into pace pretty well.  Somewhere in here there was a lady with a sign on her back saying ""Through God all things are possible"" except maybe not that because I think that's it's always sunny in Philadelphia.  Something in that vein anyways.  Immediately after we passed her cadette brought up Alan Webb, and I was like did that sign was made you think of him right?  And I nearly lost her as she started laughing.  Genuinely surprised the mile wasn't slow because of it.  Crossed the 10k mat in right around 40 and knew that was 6:25 pace, so we were pretty close to the goal factoring the downhill start.  Felt a hair tight, but like everything was doable at this point.

Splits[6:39, 6:26, 6:22, 6:26, 6:26, 6:27]

Next section of the race was kind of a blur.  The talking died off a bit.  Every split mat there was a positive thing said like ""we're doing great"" between cadette and I.  I'm pretty sure I said we're killing it every time because I'm unoriginal.  I don't remember a ton of this section to be honest.  I remember just cruising along and it feeling like I was out for a long run.  It felt like no effort at all to hit the paces.  I remember that I crossed the half in a half PR and it didn't feel scary like it has in previous marathons.  Just said to Cadette that we would need the tiniest of negative splits, but we got this.

Splits[6:27, 6:31, 6:31, 6:26, 6:33, 6:27, 6:26]

Around 14 or so I left Cadette behind.  And by that I mean I kinda knew she was close behind me and would do the veteran move of flying by me as soon as I showed any weakness.  Knocked off a couple more solid miles, until I hit 16 or 17 and things started to get a little tight.  I knew this tightness.  Every time it's happened it's followed with a wall of cramps that go up and down the backs of my legs.  It feels a bit like a spiderweb, where the lines are tingly and a little painful, and the places the lines cross are incredibly sharp and painful.  It almost always comes on a mile or two after the tightness shows up.  I told myself hold it off until Lemondrop hill at 22.5 and then I can get the rest of the way to the finish on gumption.  There was no negotiating with cramps.  They showed up at 18 regardless of my feelings on the matter.  Still managed to hold on okayish until 20.

Splits[6:25, 6:27, 6:29, 6:30, 6:35, 6:32, 6:48]

Took my last Maurten hoping it would help.  It did not.  Instead I burp/dry heaved all the way to the finish.  Thanks magic Swedish energy gels.  Got passed by Cadette at some point around here.  Kept her in sight for awhile, but couldn't remotely hang.  Muscled my way through the cramps as well as I could, but it was _not_ fast.  My range of motion was about a foot total on each stride.  Lemondrop didn't do much to my pace, but it was already so shot that it was hard to affect.  Somewhere around 24 I think, there was a sharp right turn with a steep descent that I was completely oblivious to.  Dropped an F bomb as the searing pain from that drop made it's way up my leg.  Kept strugglebussing my way to the finish, telling myself every second I can hold onto is one more second that my qualifier is safe.  In the end it probably won't be enough for that, but it got me through to the end at least.

[7:01, 7:10, 7:30, 7:36, 7:36, 7:39, 6:55 pace for the last 0.36]

Total: 2:56:46

### Post-race
Walked approximately a full marathon to the drink tent and grabbed a beer with Cadette, her husband, and Run_INXS where the marathoners commiserated their positive splits, and the smart one of us was thankful to run the half.  After a shower and a lot of grimacing at obstacles like curbs, Run_INXS and I grabbed a post race lunch and beer and talked about future race plans and certain track clubs in the news right now.  

### Final Thoughts
Final thoughts about the race.  I'm a little dissapointed that my time wasn't the one that I dreamed off.  I don't think I went out too agressively.  Talking was not difficult in any way for the first 16 miles.  My heart rate was exactly where I thought it should be or even a little low.  Maybe the travel took more out of me than I thought and I should have readjusted.  Maybe the heat was just enough that I should have backed off a hair.  Maybe I need to figure something out other than gels, because I clearly don't digest them.  I am proud that I fought through the cramps to finish.  That's by far and away the longest I've dealt with them.  I am proud that I finally finished a marathon with 0 walking, because I can tell you I was pretty desperate to stop.  One day I'll nail the marathon.  Hopefully on December 5th of this year in Sacremento.

927,AdvancedRunning,JPizzzle15,Hamstring Cramping in Marathon Today,"Hi!

I ran the Grandma's Marathon today and I did ok - I got a 21 minute PR (3:14:37) but my goal is to get to Boston. Was running 6:30's for the first 16 miles and then cramping kicked in and had to run-walk the last 10. Crash and burn with slow splits in the 9+ territory (hamstring would start to cramp and I'd stop to stretch toes and hammy out. Not fun last 10 miles).

Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/5497062061](https://www.strava.com/activities/5497062061)

Training: 40-60 MPW the past 6 months with two days of speed workouts a week + long run on weekends. I had a great training block with my training and felt that my RP was obtainable but the leg cramping felt like I just wasn't prepared at all for today. I will also note, I have definitely been slacking on leg strength training and core work.

Wanted to gauge the community and see what you fast fast people think. I am happy to answer any other questions y'all have about my training. This training included a 1:22:10 half marathon in February that I ran and felt wonderful at the end of. 

Thanks and always appreciate the amazing advice from /AR.",1624154275
928,AdvancedRunning,Chonnywalker,Increasing mileage V consistency,"I’m 31 male and have been running around 35 mpw since February (5-6 core/stability training per week) and since then have run the following times:

5k - 18:56
10k - 40:14
Half marathon - 1:31 

My question is: if I stay consistent at 35mpw for say another 3 months are my times likely to continue to improve, or am I likely to have plateaued or will plateau soon at that mileage? 

For context, I ran 19:30 for the 5k in February after around 6 weeks of training (20mpw roughly) but had a fair bit of latent fitness from football (soccer) and general fitness over last 10 years. 

My goals are:
5k - 18:30
10k - sub 39

929,AdvancedRunning,ER24,Any modification recommendations to Hal Higdon's 'Advanced 1' to hit sub-3?,"M/26

Looking for any recommendations on how I could mod the above mentioned program to hit sub-3. This is my third spring/summer season of marathon training. Had a stress fracture 2 years ago due to poor footwear that took me out for 4 weeks, and last year's race was cancelled, so I haven't actually completed a marathon, but I have a decent amount of training + 7 or so additional years of casual/intermediate running under my belt.

So far I've completed week 1 of 'Advanced 1'. Instead of 3mi/5mi/3mi on Mon/Tue/Wed I did 4/7/4, and instead of the 10 mile long run, I'm doing 13 because I was already at 13 mile long runs this season prior to starting the program. Completed 13 last week at 1:40:00ish, which I know puts me no where near sub-3. My main focus is getting my pace down over the next 17 weeks. I completed the 5 mile tempo run in week 1 today, and was only able to maintain 2/5 miles at 6'50"". The 3 others were low 7's.

If I can't hit sub-3 this October, I'd like to try again in May 2022. I would appreciate any input/advice on getting this done. I know my times are sub-par right now, but I'm beyond determined to get this done and willing to put in the work.

933,AdvancedRunning,Melloncollieocr,Advice for Setting a Pace for Pfitz Training,"I'm 3 weeks into the 17 week Pfitz plan (55-70M/ week). i have not run a marathon in 5 years, and have been keeping fit/ running &gt; 1800mi/ year, but not really at an advanced pace. I am now working my way back to a 3:15 Full goal, and have 3 week under the belt from the training log. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the runs have been... let's call it, accomplished, but far from ""crushed"". I am using a matrix of pace goals + HR boundaries, and for sure if I get anywhere near the pace goal, my HR goes over for the prescribed run. 

So here is my actual question: Is this okay? To be hitting my HR too high, and getting a little tired for subsequent runs? Will my Heart catch up, or do I need to reduce my goal to something like a 3:30 race, and then pick up the training pace as I go. There is much less speed work in Pfitz, seems to focus more on LT runs, so I'm not sure how to ""get faster"". It's a chicken or egg issue, do I train at the pace I want to run or will I burn out, get injured? I'm def. tanked after a 16M run with 8M @ race pace, feel *totally* drained.

Would really appreciate some support from the community, thank you in advance.",1624053501
934,AdvancedRunning,HoleInTheAir,Improving 400m times with 2-3 workouts per week,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 29 year old male, 5'11 and 205 pounds. I am more of a lifter than runner, but love interval training and speed work. I have no background in track, but played football through high school, and ran a bit during college. I managed a 5:28 mile and 19:57 5K around that time, while mostly lifting and running around 10 miles per week.

Fast forward a few years, and I recently starting interval training again, because I was tired of just weights. I wanted to see if I could run a sub 60 400m today, and managed a 58.85, which was a PR and nice surprise. In the last three to four weeks, I would do two workouts; one was a 4x400 with 1:30 rest, averaging around a 5:50 pace, the other a 10 x 0.10 with 1:00 rests, averaging around 4:50 for that workout. I should mention that my times deteriorate dramatically with distance. I recently did the 800m in around 2:28, and I'd be hard pressed to crack sub 6 right now on the mile. 

I want to try and get to a 54-56 400m, and I would ideally like to dedicate two to three workouts to this per week. What do you all think of this set-up below? 

* Workout 1 - 4-6 x 200m with 3:00 rests - longer rest periods, focusing on top speed
* Workout 2 - 2-4 x 800m with 3:00 rests - more of an endurance focus
* Workout 3 - 10 x 0.10 with 1:30 rests - focusing on speed endurance

As mentioned, I also lift four days per week, so these would be on my 'off days', and perhaps one of them after a lifting session.

Any other ideas/thoughts?",1624037914

BLUF: I have been on a ship without a place to run for 4 months. I am now back on land and I have 6 weeks to maximize all aspects of cardiovascular shape for a week long physical screener. I am trying to improve my 1.5 mi, 4 mi, and 6mi. I understand that is further limited by time the body needs to adapt to physiological stressors. 

My info: 

Age: 25
Sex: M 
MPW: 30 mi w/ varying pace
Peak MPW: 50 mi
Workouts: easy runs, cruise intervals, speed intervals, long slow runs 
Goals: 8:00 1.5 mi

Questions:

(1) I have unsurprisingly learned I got way out of shape: HR, paces, comfort, strength have all decreased. What is the most effective use of my time to rebuild aerobic capacity and anaerobic ability? 

(2) how should the 6 week window affect my training and adaptability? 

(3) Would lots of low impact, zone 2 training on top of my running be beneficial? 

(4) I have 6 weeks to train. I will also be swimming, lifting, and doing other workouts, but I have 24/7 to train. What is the no BS way to proceed? What can be expected? 

(5) what are the best ways to expedite recovery?

938,AdvancedRunning,[deleted],Weird burnout? Or something else?,"Context: High school xc/tf runner, just finished my spring season and am currently in the off-season between summer training. 

I had a problem for most of the spring where my legs would feel weak and heavy. They would slightly ache in my lower hamstring and calf when walking around, and when I would start my runs my form would feel incredibly bouncy or my legs would feel light. This would continue for a mile until pain set in and I would feel like garbage for a few miles. After a few miles of that, my right foot would go numb and my legs would feel a lot better.

This never really impacted my race performances in track because it takes a bit of time to set in on the runs. I am 8/12 days into my off season and this has not gotten better with rest. My legs just feel like garbage when I wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

This race is popular one in my area and with my club so I decided to sign up to have a go at racing a 5K with some very good runners and to see where my fitness is currently at. I've just started a marathon training programme for October with a view to running sub-3 hours (fingers crossed all goes to plan) and I'm coming off the back of another big PB for a 10K around a month ago (37:43 - around 4 min faster than my previous PB). I've not really raced 5K since taking running more seriously around 2 years ago and my previous PB (18:21) on a solo time trial during lockdown last year. So I didn't really have any idea where I was at with both my fitness and ability.

**Gear**

I've added this in here as I made an interesting observation on the starting line with a friend of mine. We'd both turned up in our old reliable Cliftons but seemed to be only people there that weren't wearing a pair of carbon plated shoes. I've recently just invested in some carbon plated shoes myself but I didn't have chance to break them in prior to this race and so I played it safe. Perhaps there were a few more seconds I could've taken off my time if I'd gambled on using my new carbon plated shoes...

**Training**

I previously mentioned that my training has just started ramping up for a marathon in October. I've decided to go with a Jack Daniels 2Q plan with the aim to run around 80-110 km per week during this (depending on peak). It's early days for this plan so I don't credit any of the results in this race to that programme, however, I have been running around 70-80 km consistently for the past 18 months during the pandemic. Each week contained at least one (usually two) quality sessions (usually interval and/or tempo) and a long run of about 21-28 km. Personally, I think this consistency over the past 18 months is where my current success is coming from. I'm feeling stronger and more resistant to injury (which was a major hurdle earlier in my running time) and I think this has allowed me to fully kick on. Consistency is key!

**Pre-race**

This race was an evening one so I had a relatively large pasta-based lunch and a small snack at about 4 pm (banana soreen - the dream!). Additionally, the past 3 or 4 days I've been really upping my water intake to make sure I'm fully hydrated as I knew it'd be a warm one. I also did a small tempo session 2 days before to keep the legs feeling sharp and I did some super easy miles the day before the race to keep the legs ticking over.

**Race**

As pleased as I am with the result, my goodness the race was horrible! I think 5K might be my least favourite distance to race. It's just pain from start to finish and it's just about grinding it out for what feels like an eternity!

The race started on a track so it was a quick (probably too quick) first km. I checked my watch coming off the track and I was running 3:10 min/km which was clearly unsustainable. I backed off a bit but still ran the first km far too quickly (3:25 min/km). I think this pace check gave me a wobble as I slowed a bit below my ideal pace for the next 3 km. These were the hardest parts of the race. From km 2 to km 4 simply sustaining a pace close to my stretch goal target of pace of 3:35 min/km felt impossible. It was made worse as initially (2 km) I was overtaken by a few familiar faces, making me feel like I was slowing down fairly quickly. However, I ended up taking over the same faces at the back end of my 3 km which gave me a huge boost mentally. The only problem was my body (legs, core, lungs) were all screaming at me to stop before I passed out. Fortunately, the 4 km marker flew by and that gave me enough of a boost to push on towards the end. However, the final sting was the final 300 m on the track to the finish. These were the longest 300 m of my life to date. And they were made much worse by the fact I was caught in a game of cat and mouse with a club mate who just pipped me to the line! That being said, I'm pretty sure this to-ing and fro-ing between us dragged me through to a huge PB so I could only thank him!

**Post-race**

Initially I just tried to not collapse but within a couple of minutes all was well with the world again and it began to sink in that I'd managed a huge 5K PB. I'm now writing this, rehydrating, and eating ice cream as I think I'm still cooling down from the race (it was a warm one...).

**Summary**

Now the result is sinking in, I'm glad I pushed myself as much as I did and it's given me a huge confidence boost moving forward with my marathon goal of sub-3 hours.

Was able to keep a 6:50 pace (for the last 8 miles only as called for) until about 13.7 miles in to the run (so completed 5.7 of the 8 at target marathon pace) and then had to slow down to about a minute slower at 7:50 for the last two miles and change. 

I have otherwise been able to do all the runs at the target paces. 

Should I be adjusting my goal and thus my target paces at this point? 

I don't really have any prior race times to try to estimate what a good goal pace would be. I feel pretty good on the plan right now but came in with a base of between 50-60 mpw.

My concern is overreaching and being counterproductive if I don't have an outside shot at 3:00. My heart rate was higher than his recommended marathon pace heart rate of 88 of your max pretty much once I got to the 6:50 splits but it was over 80 degrees and sunny.",1623961157

I'm looking for feedback on setting race goals after a relatively long (marathon) race hiatus. M31 and have been running for 10 years. Most recent marathon PR of 3:18 in spring 2016 on the Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 plan plus a bit of extra mileage (average 40-45mpw).

Since then, I've kept running but volume has been inconsistent, ranging anywhere between 15 and 40mpw for the last 5 years. I'm currently training for an October marathon, just finished 10 weeks of base building (worked up to 35mpw) and 1 week into Hansons advanced plan. I did a 10K time trial by myself of 44:30 towards the end of base building and am currently basing my marathon training runs on a 3:15 target. So far hitting my paces fine (first track workout 12x400m was comfortably under 6:30 target with each interval at a 5:50-6:20 pace) but haven't started tempos yet.

My goal was to go sub 5 in a mile or 1600 cause a mile is 1609 which is dumb, but besides the point I eventually ended up achieving it but it had its consequences. Almost every night before each race not even a 1600 I would get almost little to no sleep and I’ve had problems with anxiety in the past but never like this even when my mind was calm and I’d taken melatonin and done everything I could aka going to sleep earlier I still would close my eyes and stay awake.

I would do things like 3000 sit-ups 80 minute planks all in the effort to be the best runner I could be.

I ran when I was allowed to (following doc and PT advise), and did a lot of cross-training. However, I think that I lost fitness in some key glute/hamstring/quad muscles. I was just starting to get back into mid-level mileage this past month (30-40 mpw) when one knee started hurting. I kept running through it (of course), and then the other knee started hurting two weeks later. Now I have all the classic signs of Runner's Knee (and have a formal diagnosis).

My PT and coach have me doing a lot of strengthening exercises, which I'm doing daily. I'm also going to see if Cortisone shots will help reduce the pain while I try to work on my muscle imbalances. I've ordered an under the knee wrap/brace for each leg to help out a bit.

For anyone else who has had this, do the strengthening exercises help? Have you had luck with the shots, and the wraps/braces? I do have one race coming up (Mt.

*History*

Who doesn't like ice cream sandwiches?! From [Lauren Fleshman's Workout of the Week series on Strava](https://blog.strava.com/wow-the-icecreamsandwich-9584/).

*What*

This workout is basically an easier variant of The Lumberjack. Apparently the magic of the workout happens in the final tempo, when your body has to clear the lactate acid built up during the 6x1' hard set. The second tempo will feel like a slow pace after the hard 1 minutes! If you find it too easy, increase the tempo time up to 12-15 minutes.

* 10-15 minute warmup
* 10 minute at tempo pace w/2-3 minutes rest
* 6x (1 minute hard, 1 minute rest) w/2-3 minutes rest at the end of the set
* 10 minute tempo
* 10-15 minute cooldown

*How*

Tempo portions at slightly faster than half marathon pace, 1' intervals at about 3000m pace.  For a variations, the tempos on either end can build up to 15 minutes each or you can even do them as a progression, increasing every 5 minutes.",1623849800
956,AdvancedRunning,tomatessechees,VAM: running vs. cycling," \[cross-posted on r/cycling\]

For those who run and do road cycling (and live near mountains!), I am curious about your experiences with average vertical speed (VAM). Are your numbers mostly the same or are there big differences?

I personally use this to manage efforts on cycling climbs &gt;6%, and also keep a close eye on it during long ascents trail running. I also use it as a proxy for aerobic fitness.

For example, right now, for a 20 minute duration, at the same perceived effort (near maximum) cycling I can sustain a \~1100 m/h VAM and \~1250 m/h VAM running/speed hiking. If I put in the weight numbers (65kg me + 10kg bike+bottles), this would imply that I am only 1.5% more efficient (effectively 0% given the uncertainties on the numbers) on a bicycle, which doesn't seem to make sense as I had assumed that cycling should be more biomechanically efficient than running/hiking.

At the extreme end, for 30 minutes Kilian Jornet can maintain 2000m/h running (i.e., a VK race in half an hour) and 1800 m/h ski mountaineering. Unfortunately, I don't know his numbers on a bike...but top professional cycling climbers can usually sustain about 1800 m/h on fairly long climbs.

Was wondering if  anyone has returned to running after a hip scope and what their experience was like. I tore my labrum at the end of 2019, had it  repaired October of 2020 (everything delayed due to covid)

Did  my PT and returned to running very slowly but basically everything  constantly bothered me. Body was not used to the impact and motions as  I'd basically been sedative for 18 months. 

Piriformis  is never something that's bothered me but it's been persistent for  months now. I can barely jog a couple miles without it flaring up. I  took a month off because I had my gallbladder removed (hooray for more  surgery), and the piriformis acted up immediately.

* 31 Male (175cm 67kg) , training for my first ever Marathon (Amsterdam, 18 weeks from now).
* Averaging 60km/week (37 MPW) for more than a year, currently at 70km/week (43MPW). Never peaked higher than 45MPW (never tried to either).
* Training so far mostly consist of: Easy, Tempo and Long Runs (usually around HM distance) with limited speedwork/anaerobic running.
* Recent best efforts: 20km in 1:17:10, 10M in 1:00:51 (none were in perfect conditions. Both felt like longer would be ok, faster would be very difficult)
* Target: There isn't any PR to beat, but Sub3 is a must. I hope that a good training cycle could get me in the low 50s.

**Question:**

I am thinking about doing a Pfitz cycle, but can't decide which option to pick:

1. Start the 18/55 plan now, which means decreasing my mileage by 10M in week 1 (-25%)
2. Build up mileage over the next 6 weeks then start the 12/70 plan (week 1 is 55MPW (+25%))
3. Maintain base and rest a bit over the next 6 weeks to then start the 12/55 plan
4. Tune up the 55 plan by turning day offs into recovery days when it feels right

35/F running off and on for 17 years. 
I'm trying to beat my all-time PR of 19:35 (20 years old). Most recent 5k race time was 19:51 at 33 before COVID hit :(
Goal 1 is sub 19:30 and goal 2 is sub 19min 5k. Would like to go lower obviously, but starting with clearly attainable goals first!

Planning a 5k time trial in a couple weeks to see where I'm at. 
Recently started a focused track workout series but I don't really know what I'm doing.
Been doing repeats and sprints, recalling workouts from when I was on teams and from things I have read from running forums.

Current best times from interval workouts:
1000m = 3:32min
800m = 2:49min
400m = 81s
200 = 35s
100 = 14-15s

All my times have fallen below or between the range for projected 18:50-19:50min 5k based on pace calculators. So it seems my goals are within reach? Most of my track times cluster below the 18:50min projection, which I am hoping is promising!

What kinds of resources should I use for constructing my workouts? I feel on track, but don't have a reference point (other runners). I think my times are good? I am working very hard to hit this goal. The early summer weather has been a challenge for me - I don't do well in the heat.

Recent workouts (the descending ladder is a fav) have been like:
2x800, 4x400, 4x200, 4-6x100
3x1000 (planned 5 but the weather killed me)
5x3min with 90s rest, 3x1min sprints (forest run)
4.4km tempo run 

Would getting a professional coach be advisable?
Please let me know if you have some helpful tips on how to reach my goals or feedback on my track workouts or times :)

I’ve been dealing with PF for around 6 months. I went to a new running specific PT, and they focused a lot on my toe flexibility. My pinky toe had been migrating and they suggested buying a pair of toe spacers to correct it, and I’ve been wearing them consistently since (brand - Correct Toes). Additionally, they noticed I have a tendency to clench my toes, which affects my walking motion in a way where I will shuffle my feet instead of allowing my foot naturally roll off itself. Subsequently, this is believed to overload my plantar fascia, and may be contributing to my PF. I’ve been given some exercises to help address that issue, and have been able to manage the PF and keep pain levels down to around a 1-2 while continuing to train.

I do however notice that I have to be intentional about ensuring I roll my feet as opposed to shuffling them while running. It’s not hard, and it feels better, with a palpable increase in efficiency, but I still have to be intentional about it and I’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience in making a correction to their running form.

This is a broad question, so stick with me. Beginner running plans are all structured around time, whereas advanced plans are all mileage based.

A 3 hour marathoner is considered to be a pretty strong runner, but they're racing at 2/3rds of the pace of an elite marathoner. Even if the training pace gap isn't the same, a 20% difference in training pace leads to them spending quite a bit more time on the road, and a lot of people running 3.5-4 hour marathons are still running 70 mile/week plans, but are spending a ton more time on the road than faster runners.

What was weird was that wearing flip flops or going barefoot did not hurt at all but wearing closed back shoes irritated my heel and it hurt a lot. I took a month off of running and walking (only biking which sort of felt ok). I went to a sports medicine doctor but they couldn’t really figure out if it was tendinitis or bursitis. 

In March, I tried on some new running shoes that came up higher in my heel and sure enough it did not hurt at all to run or walk! I was able to ease back into running and walking in normal shoes with little to no pain. Hooray! I went on to run track and had one of my best seasons. 

Anyways over the past couple of days I’ve noticed my Achilles and calf is really tight which has happened every now and then since my injury. It’s not painful like it was back in February (nowhere’s near that bad and it’s more stiffness not pain - also higher up on my leg) but it just feels stiff and heavy where my other leg does not.

I ran through foot pain last summer for a month (what I thought was plantar fasciitis). This isn’t pain though so I’m thinking I should just stretch my calf a lot.... I know this sounds weird, but I have a feeling that even if I took a month off and did nothing, my Achilles will still feel tight and exactly the same. Since the running does not seem to be hurting it, I’ve figured I should just stretch more and keep running. I honestly can’t feel anything when I’m racing or training.

* **Name:** St. Jude Benefit Run
* **Date:** June 12th, 2021
* **Distance:** 5K
* **Location:** Yates City, Il
* **Time:** 18:50

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|

### Splits
| Mile | Time |
|------|------|
| 1 | 5:51
| 2 | 6:05
| 3 | 6:16

### Training
I've been putting in 30-35 MPW. Workouts have been either 800M intervals or 1K intervals

### Pre-race
I was feeling stiff in the days leading up to the race and wasn't sure why. My shoes are pretty new, I've been resting well and my easy runs this past week were very easy. Thankfully I woke up this morning feeling better and was ready to go after a proper warmup

I had no real expectations for this race, other than to use it as a dress rehearsal of sorts for a four mile race next Saturday. My last race was a 3 mile run in September that I ran in 17:10, while my 5K best is 17:50. I was not expecting to PR here, but I was set on running a relatively hard effort regardless. I figured if I ran this at a 5:45 to 5:50 pace, I'd be happy. As you can see from my split times, this didn't happen, which I'll explain in a moment

### Race
I did not account for potential humidity. It was humid - it was almost 80F at seven in the morning when the race started with a relative humidity of ~90% and dew point of around 72 or 73

I started just fine, didn't go out too fast, and hit the first mile right around where I thought I would. But it was also just as I completed that first mile that the adrenaline wore off and I started realizing how difficult it was to breathe. I slowed down a bit, though this didn't help much, and from basically the halfway point onward the race turned more into a mental battle. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to stop to catch my breath - I was sweating bullets and felt like my lungs had collapsed. But I asked myself repeatedly ""How bad do you want it?"", and the answer was ""Bad enough to adjust our expectations and grind this out"". I slowed down a little more during the second mile, but it honestly didn't feel like it made much of a difference, and I gave the final quarter of a mile whatever energy I had left to finish relatively strong

It also didn't help that this course is just long, straight stretches of nothing - Yates City is a town of 750 people out in the middle of a bunch of country. There's nobody to cheer you on along the course and nothing particularly interesting to see

### Post-race
I crossed the finish line and immediately sat down with the coldest bottle of water I could find. It genuinely felt like I'd never run a 5K before. I caught my breath for a few minutes before talking with some of the race organizers and a few people who finished after me. Then I ran back onto the course to find my friend Jason (who was running with his dog) and ran with him until he finished. We talked a bit after, I drank a ton more water, then I went home

At first I was disappointed with how this went; I was expecting much better than a 6:04 pace. But when I got home, I did some reading on how humidity affects running, and apparently, given the conditions, I performed just fine. I found a ""calculator"" someone else on this subreddit made in Google Sheets that takes temperature, dew point, etc, into account and tells you what your adjusted pace should be given the humidity. Apparently I was right around where I should be, which made me feel a bit better. I also reminded myself that physically, I felt fine during the race, never felt like I was straining or cramping - even now, sitting here typing this, I don't feel particularly sore or anything. I was a lot more accepting of my time/performance once this was all put into perspective. And honestly, I'm just proud that I conquered the mental aspect of it too

I also won first place by a couple of minutes and they gave me fifty dollars, so I took my brother out to pizza for dinner

### What's Next?
Not a lot of time to relax, I'm running [Steamboat Classic](https://www.steamboatclassic.org/4-mile/) next Saturday. Really hoping it's not as humid, though the course should be better

974,AdvancedRunning,buhritscold,Strength Training for Half Marathon,"Hello, I (24 M) have recently begun training for a HM in September. This will be my second, first was done in November 2019. In training for that I did not do any strength training, only aerobic training. I’d still consider myself a novice runner because I began doing it to lose weight and am still of bigger stature (6’3” 245, 230 for 2019 HM) so doing these long distances often take their toll. I haven’t ran more than 5 miles since 2019. Also never ran track or cross country in school or competitively so I have never seen a strength program for long distance runners. However, two years down the line I’m now a Strength &amp; Conditioning coach and have made the first phase of a program for myself based on what I think seems right. I’m curious too see what those with more running experience at longer distance think.

975,AdvancedRunning,Sensitive_Buy1656,Heart Rate Zone Questions,"I have some pretty basic questions about heart rate zones but I am having trouble finding good resources. 

Questions: -I've read it can be unhealthy to spend too much time up in your peak range. What are the risks? 

\-Do I need to be changing my training to spend more time in the ""cardio"" zone? (Tips for how to stay in that range given that I can't easily see my HR while running?)

\-How do I improve my fitness so that I can push my body harder while staying in lower zones? 

\--

Core Problem: -All of my runs have me in my peak heart rate zone according to my Fitbit (usually a peak of around 195) regardless of how hard I feel I'm running. Monday I did what felt like a pretty easy 1.5 miles (9:14 pace) and my HR was up at 188, Thursday I hit my 1.5 mile PR since returning to running (8:13) and my HR was up to 198. Today I did 4.4 miles, average pace 9:28, HR max 194 - it got up into my ""peak"" zone very quickly and stayed there the whole run. 

About Me: I'm a 30F, 5'6"" 143 (currently working on shedding a few extra pounds in healthy way, it's a struggle. Resting heart rate - 60-63 BPM. 

Activity: Currently doing about 10-15 miles in a week, after running my first half marathon last month. I completed the half marathon doing a walk-jog method trying to come back from an injury. I had been building up miles using that method, running almost every day, for about 5 months. Since the half marathon I have been running 1.5 miles every day, with longer runs on weekends. The length of the long runs has been very variable and time dependent. Today's 4.4 was the longest I've done without walking this year. But I often get in longer runs with the walk jog method. I have been doing a daily stretching routine and for the last 3 weeks doing a beginner strength workout for runners 3 times a week (both on Dynamic Runner). Both stretching and strengthening have made a HUGE difference for how my body feels and for my ability to push pace over the last month. I struggle quite a lot with picking up pace although I have been improving lately, it's slow progress. I feel a little incompetent that my PR was still over an 8 minute mile, after 6 months of working pretty hard on it. 

Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated! (Also - I'm sorry if this isn't the right tip of post for this sub. Should this be in /running instead?)",1623542524

Got to the track and didn't feel so hot on the warmup (HR climbed up to 170s). Was debating if I even wanted to run a mile anymore with the mix of nerves and everything else. 

First 409m (74) : Went out in 36 feeling alright. Morale was already taking a hit on the opening lap. Debated walking off after the first lap

800m 2:30 (76) : This point kinda started dilly dallying in my head thinking about random stuff not even thinking about the pace so it dropped. Had the same exact thought as the previous lap but kept on trucking

1200m 3:46 (76) : My attention mainly went to dodging the people walking in lane 1 and 2 and going around the clowns running two wide in those same lanes.

1609m 4:58 (72): Had a o shit moment when I realized when I was on the final lap. Decided to turn on the jets a little but wasn't hunched over when I finished.

Final time: 4:58.8

Post race thoughts: 

I need more motivation to push myself. Probably gave 90% of the tank today. Definitely think I'm capable of sub 4:50 but need someone to chase or to relax the nerves a little more pre race. Honestly happy to still break 5 on a off day where I wasn't present at all mentally though. My old mile PR is 4:57 and my chest was burning for 4 hours the last time I ran this distance like 6 years ago.

977,AdvancedRunning,SpecialFX99,Update: I tried to run my fastest mile yesterday!,"This is an update to [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/n1xvzt/how_to_run_my_fastest_mile/) which was a wealth of information for me. Thank you to everyone that responded!

I'm not going to make you read all the text if you just want to see my result so here it is: I ran 5:18 and couldn't be happier!

I didn't manage to follow any one person's advice completely but I took bits and peices from everyone, substituted a couple races for speed work, did one time trial and adjusted my warmup routine.

I was really shocked how fast I could get back to running even after pretty intense speed work. I think I had been doing my speedwork too easy and not often enough out of fear I'd take too long to recover. I saw the difference in speed pretty fast once I upped the frequency and intensity. 

I did a time trial on as similar route as possible to the race route and despite losing my focus in the middle and falling off pace a bit I managed a 5:39 when my race goal was only 5:45. I had no idea how much more I had in me so I went into the race just trying to best that time. A local coach told me he thought I was good for 5:15 and I just laughed at him.

Imagine that! The coach knew what he was talking about! I don't have much to say about the race. I did a 20 minute warmup with 5 strides, lined up at the back of the pack and ran like hell to the finish. I was surprised to find I had a really strong kick still and managed to pick 2 people off in the last 50 feet or so. No DFL like I was worried about!

The whole lead up to the race I felt like a poser for entering the elite heat but I felt a little more justified when there were 12 people behind me and my time would have been 2nd OA in the open heat. Don't get me wrong, I know I'm nowhere near being an elite runner but I think I at least belonged in the elite heat for this race.

Thanks again for everyone who responded with advice in my first post. I'll end with some advice of my own. Don't be scared to jump into the deep end. You might find out that you have been selling yourself short and are capable of a lot more than what you give yourself credit for!

[INSTAGRAM POST](https://www.instagram.com/p/CP_ahvQrtrK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Allie Ostrander has been in treatment for a month and a half for an eating disorder. This treatment is not entirely voluntary. This is why she has been in Denver for her last few videos.

I have very little to add to this. Please watch the video if you are interested; I think she does a phenomenal job explaining what she is going through right now. Unlike most athletes who share their story, she has not recovered. She is, as she says, currently ""in the shit."" She has chosen to share her journey from here on out. Again, she elaborates on her reasoning in the video.

People are constantly asking questions on this sub about nutrition, and I feel like our community is a great place to get (non-professional) advice, with a constant emphasis on your own personal growth and success over what you should specifically eat or how your body should look or weigh. But that's never enough for people who are struggling.

I thought I'd make this post in hopes that it may spark some discussion, or at the very least remind people who are ""in the shit"" that you're not alone. Allie O has been one of my favorite athletes for years now, and it's crushing to see her go through this, but she's sharing it with all of us. Let's wish her the best on her road to recovery.

After this track season ended my coach (Reuben Reina) gave me a three week break where I could only run 4-5 miles every other day. This alone was pretty disheartening because I had been on a roll when it came to running. He started me back up running daily on the first of June, but when I saw the workout plan I felt even worse. I’d only be doing 28 miles the first week, 30 miles the second week, and by the end of the month only 39 miles.

Is he trying to prevent over training and injury? Because I had been doing much more mpw than these first few weeks even when incorporating speed workouts during the winter.

I was an occasional runner prior to November 2020, so running economy was mediocre with lots of room for improvement. Here's the results for both:

December 2020:

last 20 avg HR: 191 (max 193)

Obvious improvement, but what confuses me is that the drop in HR. Did I not push hard enough? I don't think I could have pushed harder honestly. Is in normal to decrease max HR?

I've had weight problems (overweight because of eating too much) for the most of my life. I've started running 5 years ago and this has helped to significantly reduce weight, so even though I think I'm still eating too much, I'm 82 kg/185 cm, so it's not too bad.
I'm currently running around 80 km / 50 miles per week and I know I have to taper before races to get better results, but I'm always scared that if I start running less, I'll quickly gain weight again, which will impact both my result in the race and my general self-esteem. How do you deal with this? How do you explain yourself that you have to run less to achieve more?",1623356967
999,AdvancedRunning,duffingtonbear,Access to a real gym once a week - most productive way to use that one day?,"I do my own bodyweight strength workouts at home to help with running multiple times a week, but my family recently got a gym membership. However, with my current schedule, I'm only going to have access to the gym around once a week. What would be the most productive way to spend this one day, since I'll have access to all the gym equipment and gear that I don't usually have at home? Any certain machines or exercises that I should make sure to look into? Thanks!",1623356494
