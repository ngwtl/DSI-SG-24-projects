# Capstone Project - Understanding the cross-section of REIT returns

## Problem Statement

I am a portfolio manager at a real estate fund of funds, and I am intrigued by recent publications in academia on machine learning and asset pricing. According to Campbell and Thompson (2008), small improvements in R2 can lead to large improvements in performance for a mean-variance investor. They show that the proportionate increase in expected excess return earned by an active investor exploiting predictive information is a function of predictive R2 and the Sharpe ratio earned by a passive buy-and-hold investor. Sharpe ratio describes how much excess return an investor's portfolio receives for the volatility he has to endure for holding on to that portfolio, and it is how my performance as a portfolio manager is assessed by my clients. 

My job is to improve my portfolio's Sharpe ratio by finding better ways to assemble my portfolio of real estate stocks to beat a buy-and-hold portfolio such as the FTSE Nareit U.S. Real Estate Index Series. I am encouraged by the recent findings of Gu, Kelly and Xiu (2020) who state that a portfolio that executes market timing on S&P 500 stocks using neural network forecasts enjoys an annualized (out-of-sample) Sharpe ratio of 0.77, as opposed a Sharpe ratio of 0.51 enjoyed by a passive buy-and-hold investor of the S&P 500 index. This is a more than 50% improvement in the risk-return tradeoff. 

## Executive Summary

For this project, datasets containing information such as mosquitos species caught, number of mosquitoes caught, presence of WNV in the mosquitos and coordinate location of traps were used. Information on the date and location of spraying and various weather parameters were also utilized. The following summarises the analysis process:

1. Impute or remove missing or duplicated data from the train, test, weather and spray datasets

2. Merge the train and spray datasets and perform EDA on the effect of spraying on presence of WNV and number of mosquitos

3. Merge the train and weather datasets and perform feature engineering and selection by evaluating the ROC_AUC score of models against the selected features iteratively 

4. Tune the hyperparameters for 18 models by gridsearching and choose the best one based on ROC_AUC score on the train set, the CV ROC_AUC score on the train set , the ROC_AUC score on the test set and finally the Kaggle score

The best model selected was the XGBoost Classifier (Model 18) as even though it has a lower ROC_AUC than the Logistic Regression (Model 17), it has a higher sensitivity which is important because Chicago city officials might make expensive decisions on mosquito-eradication methods (spray in areas we predict to be positive, and don't spray in areas we predict to be negative). Therefore it is also important to have as high true positive as possible, and as low false negative as possible. This points to using sensitivity as a secondary metric for us to use as assessment since ROC_AUC is quite close between Models 17 and 18.

The following table summarizes the performance of all 18 models:
